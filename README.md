## caveat utilitor
I haven't interpreted the results yet, nor tried to visualize; am just providing my R script and my initial output files for DH / Data journalist types / others to explore for themselves. The R script does have a piece in it for making word clouds for the various topics, where the size of the word corresponds roughly to the importance of that word in the topic. For more on MALLET and visualizing the results, see the Journal of Digital Humanities, the work of Ted Underwood, Matt Jockers, Andrew Goldstone, etc.
