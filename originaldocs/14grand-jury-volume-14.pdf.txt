GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME 14 
MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley. 
3 Today is October the 20th, 2014. It is 
Page 5 
4 approximately 8:41 a.m. I'm here present with all 
5 12 grand jurors and , the court reporter. 
6 Kathi Alizadeh is out of the room right now, but 
7 will be joining us a little later in the morning. 
8 We're going to start off this morning 
9 playing recorded statements. So I have three 
10 recorded statements of He was one of 
11 the contractors that was at the apartment complex 
12 that morning and he's already testified, but we 
13 didn't get a chance to hear his statements because 
14 he was present and we wanted to get the live 
15 testimony going. This morning we are going to go 
16 ahead and do his statements. 
17 After that I anticipate we'll listen, 
18 we'll have a live person that will testify and that 
19 is , who says that he was in one of 
20 the cars driving in when all of this took place. 
21 There is also one other witness, 
22 that is scheduled to testify hopefully this 
23 morning, and then we will probably have recorded 
24 statements toward the conclusion of the day. 
25 So with that bit of an introduction, I'm

2 I don't recall exactly how long this one 
3 is, but I don't believe it is very long. If you 
4 find any notes, I guess those are probably Kathi's 
5 if you see one with notes on it. 
6 There is two short interviews of 
7 and then there is a longer interview with 
8 the police officer. So those are the three that we 
9 will play. 
10 Probably an hour and a half total maybe. 
11 So with that bit of an introduction, I guess we'll 
12 pause the recording and go ahead and listen to the 
13 statements. 
14 (Playing of three interviews of 
15 . ) 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley

18 statements that we just listened to were from Grand 
19 Jury Exhibit Number 24. 
20 I'm going to now play the interview with 
21 that was conducted by two police 
22 officers from St. Louis County. That interview is 
23 approximately, well, it is less than an hour long. 
24 There's plenty of down time in this 
25 interview where he's just sitting in a room. I'm

8 it falls with the scheme of those things. 
9 With that bit of introduction, we'll get

12 . ) 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: That concludes the interview 
of They call it DCI. That's the 14 
15 detectives and that's Detective and Detective 
16 As I mentioned, I kind of skipped through 
17 just to the part where there was an actual 
18 interview. There was a lot of down time and the 
19 interview began at 15:27 and then it pretty much 
20 ended at 18:08:58. And the exhibit number for this 
21 interview is Grand Jury Exhibit Number 47.

So you don't know where he was shot? 
No. 
You're just guessing because he fell over? 
Yes. 
And then once he's on the ground you see 
12 the officer standing right over him and shoot him 
13 while he's lying face first on the ground? 
14

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So after the police car is a black car you

A

Not that I remember. 
And you're saying where this white car is 
19 on the map is about where Mike Brown stopped running 
20 and turned around? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And that would have been where he fell 
23 then since you said he didn't move forward or 
24 backward at this point? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.

9 MS. WHIRLEY:

11 visualize your perspective but when the scene was 
12 kind of concluding. You are still sitting in the 
13 driver's seat of your car, when you are viewing, as 
14 you said, Officer Darren Wilson, you said he's got 
15 his gun aimed, you can see his back, are they 
16 perfectly lined up, are they off to an angle, what's 
17 your perspective? 
18 A I can't understand, what's that. 
19 I'm trying to understand 
20 your perspective of what you saw from your car right 
21 as the scene was concluded. I'm going to guess you 
22 can see the back of Officer Darren Wilson, but are 
23 they standing at an angle, are they perfectly lined 
24 up, I guess, what is your perspective?

3 A The very end of the scene? 
4 Yeah. You said you could 
5 see Officer Darren Wilson's back, but you were also 
6 stating that you could that he see him shot in the 
7 head, or you assume he shot him in the head. I'm 
8 just trying to understand was that at an angle to 
9 where he could see the front of Michael Brown and 
10 the back of Officer Darren Wilson. Were they 
11 straight on, what was your angle from your 
12 perspective with respect to the vehicle? 
13 A No, he was, whatever the officer name, he 
14 was facing toward this way now on his intercom or 
15 whatnot. 
16 So you could see Officer 
17 Darren Wilson's back? 
18 A No, I couldn't. After everything is over 
19 and Mr. Brown is on the ground, I see his face, back 
20 side. 
21 You understand what I'm 
22 saying? 
23 Yeah, I do 
24 understand what you are saying. I think you say you 
25 could see Michael Brown turn around.

14 A No, while he shot him while he was laying 
15 on ground he's facing towards me. 
16 So how did he get from 
17 facing Michael Brown and watching him fall, he 
18 walked forward and shot him on the ground, how did 
19 the officer's face get towards you, did he walk 
20 around the body? 
21 A Yes, he was just proceeding around the

25 walked around the body?

21 actually, how many shots was actually fired.

A 
Q 
That was just the one I heard. 
Did he appear to be shooting him in the 
10 face the way you thought back on the 18th of August? 
11 A Yes, I would have thought it was in the 
12 face.

10 recollection of how things happened after the feds 
11 told you it couldn't have happened the way you 
12 originally described it, is that fair to say? 
13 A Yes, that's when I went and try to 
14 actually go on what I remember. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And so now your memory has 
16 changed? 
17 A No, I'm remembering what I'm telling you 
18 now. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: You told three different 
20 stories in the time we've been here today. So I 
21 want to know which one is really your memory or did 
22 you see this at all?

3 telling you. Whether that was two, three different 
4 stories, I'm only going on so much that I can 
5 remember. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: But you today said that the 
7 reason that you changed your story today? 
8 A Is because the FBI say my forensic science 
9 wasn't right. So that's why I went back and try to 
10 actually remember what I saw. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So what is your memory 
12 today, what is it? Were there nine shots, were

5 questions, this is When you first saw 
6 this happen, at one point you said you were directly 
7 behind the police officer's car? 
8 
9 
10 
A 
A 
Huh? 
You were directly --
In front of him. 
11 In front of the police 
12 officer's car? 
13 A Yes. 
14 And then at one point you 
15 said you were maybe four or five car lengths away. 
16 Did you stop four or five car lengths away? 
17 
18 
A Before I was able to approach them, yes. 
Okay. When you saw the 
19 struggle going on even though there were no cars 
20 between you, you were four or five car lengths away? 
A Yes. 21 
22 That is probably longer 
23 than this whole room, right?

2 Twice this room. And you 
3 are saying you can tell from twice the length of 
4 this room that Michael Brown was trying to get away 
5 from the police officer? 
6 A Yes. 
7 And the police officer 
8 was pulling his shirt and his neck? 
9 A Yes. 
10 And you could tell that 
11 that far away and there's no possible way that there 
12 was a struggle and Michael Brown could have been 
13 frying to fight the police officer?

And then he shoots him?

17 after Michael Brown is actually injured that he's 
18 able to get away? 
19 A Yes. 
20 Why was he not able to 
21 get away with all of his strength, non-injured but 
22 he is able to get away injured. If the police

10 scene. I don't know what was capable of happening 
11 me moving, so I just stood there.

21 proceeded, she was sitting, she was watching what 
22 was going on too. She proceeded to do what she was

7 A Why the fuck you shoot him like that. 
8 Why the fuck you shoot him 
9 like that. At any time did you think, I mean, if 
10 you reportedly saw the officer shoot this guy in the 
11 head, that he might turn and just shoot you and your 
12 passenger? 
13 A Yes, I felt that, I felt that. But at the 
14 time I didn't, I mean, at the time I'm guessing he 
15 didn't realize what he put hisself into. So I

1 investigator from our office, his name is

3 the G is silent. He actually talked with 
4 on the phone. That's Grand Jury Exhibit 
5 Number 17. 
6 And then we have another statement from 
7 , which Grand Jury Exhibit Number 49, 
8 where he spoke with the FBI. With that bit of 
9 introduction we can stop the recording and we'll go 
10 ahead and play the phone call. The phone call is 
11 like 16 minutes or so, and I think that his 
12 statement is less than an hour, so we'll see how 
13 much we can get through.
