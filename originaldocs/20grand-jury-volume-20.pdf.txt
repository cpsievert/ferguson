9 before going on the record this morning. A lot of 
10 it was to do with, some of it was to do with 
11 scheduling of what we thought we had is still left 
12 to do. And I hope I answered your questions about 
13 that. 
14 There was also talk about some concerns 
15 for safety and we talked about that and I will get 
16 you some information that I promise to get you.

1 But I did mention to you that previously you had 
2 provided me with your most recent curriculum vitae. 
3 I had marked that Grand Jury Exhibit Number 5. I 
4 forgot about putting that on when he was here 
5 previously. So can you identify that as the CV that 
6 you gave me prior to your testimony earlier? 
7 A Yes, this is the CV that I presented to 
8 you. 
9 Q Okay. And I'm going to make copies of 
10 this for everybody. I, again, just kind of forgot 
11 about this. I will get copies for everybody of 
12 that. 
13 Dr. we spoke last time 
14 about how when the body or the remains of Michael 
15 Brown were brought to the morgue and how he was in

A 
Q 
Page 8 
And is he, how long has been 
3 an employee? 
4 A I'm not sure, I don't know exactly. 
5 Q And what does he do for the medical 
6 examiner? 
7 A He's an autopsy technician and he's, he's 
8 responsible for one, helping me during my 
9 examinations. He's helpful for, you know, drawing 
10 any fluids I need for toxicology. He's helpful for 
11 weighing the body, checking in the body, and check 
12 the body for any type of personal belongings. 
13 Q And you've already testified that when the 
14 body was received by the Medical Examiner's Office 
15 and eventually the body bag was unlocked and opened, 
16 that Michael Brown still had his clothes on him; is 
17 that correct? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
His name is ? 
Yes. 
And so did assist you during your 
22 autopsy of Michael Brown? 
23 A Yes, he did. 
24 Q In fact, does he appear in some of the 
25 photos that were taken during the autopsy as well as

1 some of the morgue photos? 
A Yes, he does. 2 
3 Q And you testified that it's procedure for 
4 someone such as to check the personal items 
5 that might be on the body, any body that is received 
6 by the medical examiner's, correct? 
7 A That is correct. 
8 Q And then once the personal items are 
9 removed, are they photographed? 
10 A Yes, they are. 
11 Q All right. So previously I had introduced 
12 or offered or identified for the grand jurors a 
13 packet of photographs which I marked as Number 9, 
14 which are, I call the morgue photos. Those are 
15 different than the photos that the police took 
16 during the autopsy; is that right? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q Okay. And so I'm going to hand you a 
19 photo which was, is in the packet of Grand Jury 
20 Exhibit Number 9, and this is, on the back it says 
21 looks like, well, it says 039CD. I'm not sure if 
22 that's the JPEG number or not. But I'm going to 
23 just show you where I'm reading 039CD on the back 
24 there. And then I'm going to show you this photo. 
25 Does that look like, do you recognize that as one of

1 the photos that was taken? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
Okay. And the items in this photo would 
4 represent the items that were on the person of 
5 Michael Brown when it was received by the Medical 
6 Examiner? 
7 A Yes, they are. 
8 Q Now, this blue thing right here, was 
9 that 
10 A That's on the body bag that locks the 
11 zipper. 
12 Q Is that placed in the photograph to 
13 further identify who these items belong to? 
14 A Yes, it is. 
15 Q And then there's a placard that says St. 
16 Louis County and a number beneath it? 
17 A 
18 Q 
19 correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q

That's the Medical Examiner's number. 
Okay. I will go ahead and put this on 
25 here, and I will pass it around too. But you see in

1 this photograph two, 5 dollar bills, two, looks like 
2 disposable lighters, some paper that has some 
3 writing on it, and then this item that you talked 
4 about right here. Is that the lock that came off of 
5 the body bag? 
6 A Correct.

And then what is this item right here? 
Leafy green substance. 
Okay. And these items were all found by 15 
16 on the body? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q Now, Dr. you talked about when 
19 you were here previously that during your 
20 examination you looked at an injury or wound on the 
21 palm of the right hand of Michael Brown. Just, I 
22 can't remember how, is this --

Q Okay. Near the right thumb or thumb? 
A Right, correct. 
1 
2 
3 Q And you indicated or you testified last 
4 time that you thought that that looked suspicious 
5 for possible soot or something that you wanted to 
6 examine further? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And you also testified back then that you 
9 had cut a piece of that tissue off of the body for 
10 you to then later examine; is that right? 
A Correct. 11 
12 Q So I know you've already testified about 
13 that, but we, I want to go into a little more detail 
14 because since you were in grand jury, you've 
15 completed a report about your examination of that 
16 tissue, correct? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q And so once you cut that tissue out 
19 because you and I talked about this in a little 
20 greater detail since you were here previously, once 
21 you cut that tissue out, what did you do with it? 
22 A Okay. So anything that I have on the body 
23 that I'm concerned about that I would like to 
24 perform histology on, which I will get to in a 
25 second. I take that fresh tissue, I mean, it hasn't

1 been altered or anything, it hasn't been washed, it 
2 hasn't been manipulated. I take those pieces of 
3 tissue and I put them in a cassette. The cassette 
4 is simply a plastic chamber that holds the tissue so 
5 that it doesn't get lost or moves around and it 
6 stays positioned how it's put when I put it in the 
7 gray cassette. 
8 From that point I take that gray 
9 cassette and I put it in another container and it is 
10 filled with a fluid called formalin. Formalin is 
11 simply a preservative that gets the tissue in a 
12 state of preservation where it can now be prepared 
13 for the next step of processing. 
14 So when I took the piece of tissue 
15 off to put in a cassette and I put it in formalin 
16 for later processing, that's what I did initially. 
17 Q So did you do with then, is it still in 
18 this cassette then? 
19 A Yes, the tissue remains in that cassette 
20 in that fluid until it is transported to another 
21 facility where they will process the tissue. 
22 Q Okay. And so where does the tissue go 
23 from there? 
24 A So after it leaves my position at the St. 
25 Louis County Medical Examiner's Office, it is then

1 sent to the St. Louis University Medical 
2 School/Histology Department where it will be 
3 processed. 
4 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 75 
5 marked for identification.) 
6 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And I showed you this 
7 morning some photographs that I have put in an 
8 envelope marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 75. And 
9 do you recognize what's in those photographs? 
10 A 
11 pictures. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Yes, I do recognize what is in these 
And what are those pictures of? 
The pictures that I'm looking at right now 
14 are the samples of tissue that I took from 
15 Mr. Michael Brown's right hand that I put in that 
16 formalin liquid that I spoke with you earlier, 
17 transported it to the St. Louis Medical School for 
18 Histology and then it is processed. That tissue is 
19 then put in a wax to keep everything positioned and 
20 that's what I'm looking at right now. 
21 Q Okay. So this is after the medical school 
22 has put the tissue in a wax? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
And so you've seen this before? 
Yes.

1 Q 
Page 15 
Not only these photographs, but this would 
2 be how you would preserve and process any tissue 
3 sample that you might want to look at 
4 microscopically? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q And so I'll just show you, this is image 
7 number one and again these, this box here, is that 
8 the cassette or is that a box? 
9 A It could be either/or. It could be 
10 representative of the cassette or something else 
11 that they used. 
12 Q So these reddish, beige-ish brown things 
13 inside, that's the actual tissue? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And these are numerous photos of 
16 the same tissue; is that correct? 
17 A That is correct. 
18 Q And there's a ruler next to the box that 
19 kind of gives you perspective on the size, correct? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Do you weigh these tissue at all? 
No, I do not. 
Okay. And there's markings on the side of 
24 that box, did you make those markings? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, I did not.

Page 16 
1 Q You recognize these as the tissues that 
2 you had removed? 
3 A Yes, I do. 
4 Q Okay. And I just put on the overhead 
5 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 1 through 5 to show the 
6 grand jurors. 
7 Now, we see this is a larger kind of 
8 tray, do you know what that is? 
9 A It was just a tray for transportation 
10 purposes. 
11 Q Okay. All right. So once the medical 
12 school histology lab places this tissue in paraffin, 
13 what does it do then to prepare it for examination? 
14 A So after the tissue is put in that wax 
15 substance that you saw, that's the paraffin 
16 material, at that point, that block of tissue is now 
17 taken to be sliced with a microtone blade, which is 
18 a very sharp blade that slices very thin segments, 
19 about five micrometers, which is very thin, pieces 
20 of wax tissue with the tissue embedded. 
21 That slice is then put on a glass 
22 slide and it is then counterstained by adding a pink 
23 solution and a purple solution. One is called eosin 
24 and the other is called hematoxylin. And then that 
25 slide now has been prepared where I can look at it

1 under my microscope and examine it at a histological 
2 level. 
3 Q Did you ultimately receive some slides 
4 from the medical school that were actual, this 
5 tissue that you had removed from Michael Brown's 
6 right palm? 
7 A Yes, I do. 
8 Q Okay. Did you examine those slides under 
9 a microscope? 
A Yes, I did. 10 
11 Q And again, you've already testified about 
12 this, but I'm going to, did you take photographs of 
13 those slides as well? 
14 A I did take some photographs of the slides. 
15 Q Okay. 
16 A Or representative photos of some of the 
17 pieces. It is not everything. 
18 Q And you know, Dr. , I didn't have 
19 the opportunity to show you this this morning 
20 because by the time you got here, the grand jurors 
21 were already here. So I'm going to show you a 
22 photograph that's on Disc Number 79, Grand Jury 
23 Number 79, which actually just to tie things in, did 
24 you later time send some of those photographs and 
25 the actual slides to the Department of Defense

1 Medical Examiner for them to also examine? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes, I did. 
Okay. And we're going to hear from that 
4 doctor after we hear from you. Actually, just have 
5 to ask you if you recognize this picture? 
6 A 
7 Q 
8 there? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
You recognize what you are seeing up 
Yes, I do. 
And so is this a picture of what you would 
11 see in the microscope when you were examining that 
12 tissue? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And does this picture help you to explain 
15 to the grand jurors what you are looking at when you 
16 previously testified that you saw some particulate? 
17 A Just to take a step back and just to 
18 preface again, this is just, there are a lot of 
19 pieces of tissue that you saw on that paraffin 
20 embedded block. So when you take a slice of that, 
21 all of those slices are represented on one slide. 
22 So what you are looking at right now 
23 is just a small corner of one of those tissue 
24 fragments. So we are not looking at all of those 
25 slices at one time.

1 So this is merely just a corner or a 
2 piece of some of that tissue. 
3 Q You can use this if you feel it will help 
4 you. It will pick up your voice. 
5 A All right. So for histology, what I was 
6 telling you about the colors and the purple and the 
7 pink, once that waxed tissue is stained, it give us 
8 this pinkish color and some of these things here is 
9 the purple color. I spent a lot of time knowing 
10 what each thing is, I will just try to keep it as 
11 simple as possible. 
12 So you are looking at the edge of the 
13 tissue and the tissue that I took was from that 
14 wound that I passed around and showed up before. I 
15 took little samples of those and those were 
16 represented in the paraffin block that I showed you. 
17 This is the histology. 
18 So here, this is just regular, you 
19 know, normal tissue of the hand, this pinkish 
20 material, but here you can see these little darker 
21 areas, these little pigmented flakes, these are the 
22 foreign particulate matter that I was talking about 
23 that is not native to his hand. It had to be 
24 introduced into his hand from another source and 
25 that's some of those particulate matter that I was

1 talking about previously. Like that right there, 
2 that right there, that right there. (indicating) 
3 As I said before, this is merely just 
4 a representation, there are other areas on this 
5 slide, but this is just a representative of some of 
6 that matter that I saw. 
7 Q And so you have already testified that in 
8 your opinion those particulate, the particulate? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Particulate matter. 
Matter, that is consistent with soot? 
I would say it is consistent with products 
12 that are discharged from a firearm. What I was 
13 telling you guys before, there is lots of things 
14 that can come out of a firearm. Remember I was 
15 telling you guys talking about the primer, the 
16 primer on the cartridge is the combustible material 
17 that ignites that, then lights the gunpowder, which 
18 then propels the bullet. All of those substances 
19 together are kind of coming out of that barrel. 
20 So the definition of soot is actually 
21 burned gunpowder. So there can be different types 
22 of things in there. You can have burned, you can 
23 have unburned, you probably could have primer, have 
24 lots of different types of materials. 
25 For myself, a better way to say it is

2 with products that can be discharged from the 
3 firearm.

5 it's a lot of material.

Okay. And, Dr. , could those 
14 black or darker particulate matters that we can see 
15 on that image on the slide, could that be dirt? 
16 A In my personal opinion it is not. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 A But it is due to the circumstances and 
19 things that I know about in this case why I feel 
20 that that's not dirt. 
21 Q And what would those circumstances be that 
22 you feel that it's not dirt?

1 something of interest that I'm trying to see. 
2 So in this particular situation when 
3 I look at some Michael Brown's hand there was kind 
4 of an area of discoloration in his thumb area on his 
5 right hand that I was concerned about that this 
6 could be some type of material discharged from a 
7 firearm. 
8 To myself in looking at it, it is 
9 kind of like an experience thing, when I was looking 
10 at it, just the color of it, the nature of it, it 
11 didn't look like dirt to me. Specifically right 
12 near the wound, when I think about dirt, we have all 
13 been children or working on things that you have 
14 dirt, like dirt is all over your hands, it is not 
15 like in one little particular corner. 
16 So essentially it was associated with 
17 that particular area and it just looked different to 
18 me. I did not think that this was dirt and that's 
19 why I decided to take the next step to look under 
20 the microscope to confirm what I was looking at 
21 through my eyes. 
22 So that the next step was doing 
23 histology. So when I did this and I saw these 
24 little molecules here, the fact that they are very 
25 darkly pigmented, they are embedded in the tissue,

1 it is hard for dirt to introduce itself into tissue. 
2 Dirt usually sits on top of things, it doesn't get 
3 into things. 
4 So the fact that this is in the 
5 tissue, that let's me know that it had to be 
6 introduced into the tissue and that is going to be 
7 more consistent with products that are going to be 
8 discharged from a firearm that would be able to 
9 insert itself or get itself into those tissue. So 
10 that's why I feel this is not dirt, and this is 
11 particulate matter from the discharge from the 
12 firearm, if that makes sense. 
13 Q And, Dr. , we talked about the 
14 fact that, you know, you've already testified about 
15 what the immediate affects would have been to 
16 Michael Brown once the gunshot wound that entered 
17 the top of his head and traveled through his brain 
18 and exited out by his jawline, somewhere around 
19 there, that that was actually, would have 
20 immediately rendered him incapacitated? 
21 A Right. And just to back up, the wound 
22 that was going to be the more incapacitating, you 
23 know, the one that actually went in the top of the 
24 head and stayed in, there was another one that came 
25 over the brow that came out of the face, but the one

1 that went in and stayed in, that's the one that was 
2 going to render him immediately unconscious. 
3 Q And a person who was still perhaps on his 
4 feet who would receive that wound would immediately 
5 fall? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And would they be able to put their hand 
8 out to brace themself for a fall? 
A No. 9 
10 Q I don't know if you've seen those 
11 photographs at this time. These were images that 
12 were taken at the crime scene by Detective 
13 and they are contained in a packet that I've 
14 marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 3. And I'm going 
15 to show you Image Number 70 through 75, which are 
16 pictures of Michael Brown at the crime scene. Can 
17 you see the hand area that you were looking at 
18 during your autopsy? 
A Yes, I can. 19 
20 Q And if you can look at various pictures 
21 because it might show different views of that. His 
22 right hand is alongside his body, a little out from 
23 the body, but his palm is facing upward in those 
24 photographs; is that right?

MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody want to look 
if I pass them around? 
And it is showing the hand is exposed to 
8 air and not the ground. So it is not touching the

11 wound of the hand that I testified about earlier.

1 because 
2 A I will try my best. So start from the 
3 very beginning, upper left-hand corner you have 
4 Michael Brown and then upper right-hand corner you 
5 have our case number 2014-5143, exam case. And then 
6 it is headed as Supplemental Microscopic Examination 
7 Report. 
8 Then the next line is, Microscopic 
9 Slide Examination. 
10 And then the next paragraph, that's 
11 where I start to begin to describe some of the 
12 particular features that I'm seeing on the slides 
13 that were prepared of Mr. Mike Brown's gunshot wound 
14 to the hand. 
15 So starting with skin and muscle I 
16 say, sections of the tissue from the right hand show 
17 multiple fragments of skin and single fragment of 
18 skeletal muscle. 
19 What I was telling you before there 
20 is all of those little bits of tissue there, there 
21 is different fragments there and then one of those 
22 pieces was a piece of muscle, but it is not 
23 represented on what you just saw there. That was 
24 just one of the pictures and there is lots of things 
25 to look at, but that's in totality what I'm looking

1 at. 
2 So all of those fragments in that 
3 tissue block I looked at each individual one of 
4 them, every little corner under the microscope, so 
5 that is what that first sentence means. 
6 Next, I say there is a darkly 
7 pigmented foreign particulate matter present on the 
8 superficial surface. 
9 So that dark material that you guys 
10 saw, that is more in a deeper layer of the tissue, 
11 but on the top. Like if you think of the top of a 
12 cake, some of that similar type of material is 
13 sitting on the superficial, that means the top 
14 portion of some of those skin fragments. 
15 And the stratum corneum, on your hand 
16 skin has different layers. On your palmer skin, you 
17 have a very thick layer called stratum corneum, it 
18 is kind of the more superficial layer of your skin. 
19 It is kind of like where your skin eventually sheds 
20 and it's kind of similar to what dandruff is. That 
21 is what the stratum corneum is. 
22 So that particular layer there is 
23 pigmented material embedded within that superficial 
24 layer. 
25 As I was telling you before,

1 something has to introduce or cause those little 
2 particles to get pushed into that particular area, 
3 and that's what I'm talking about right here. 
4 Also embedded within the stratum 
5 corneum of the skin fragments. A mixture of 
6 pigmented and non-pigmented foreign particulate 
7 matter is present focally within the dermis. 
8 So when I was showing you that 
9 previous picture, there was pigmented material, that 
10 was the darker material and there was some, some 
11 things a little white in there, kind of shiny, 
12 that's the non-pigmented material. So there is a 
13 spectrum of items within the skin and that pink area 
14 that I was showing you, that's the dermis. 
15 So when you have skin, you have the 
16 stratum corneum, you have a granular layer, beneath 
17 that you start to get into your connective tissue 
18 layer of your skin, which is the next layer beneath 
19 and that's where you will kind of see pinkish 
20 tissue, that's the dermis. 
21 So in the dermis, deeper into the 
22 tissue below the skin, you still have those little 
23 foreign particulate matter introduced into the 
24 tissue. 
25 So some of the skin tissue fragments

1 within the skeletal muscle tissue fragment. So as I 
2 was telling you before, in all of those little 
3 pieces that I had there were different types of 
4 tissue, I had a piece of skeletal muscle. Skeletal 
5 muscle is even deeper than the skin, deeper than the 
6 dermis and the next layer will be muscle. 
7 So deep in that tissue injury I took 
8 some muscle out too. The muscle that I looked at 
9 under the scope also had some of that foreign 
10 particulate matter. So this matter, this foreign 
11 material was getting embedded deep into the tissues. 
12 Some of the non-pigmented particulate 
13 matter is polarizable. All that means is that when 
14 you polarize something, polarize means basically 
15 reflecting light. So there is some of the material 
16 that's in there is able to reflect light and some of 
17 the material doesn't. It is kind of a nonspecific 
18 thing, but it is important for me to describe 
19 everything that I'm seeing to let, you know, let 
20 people know that there is a mixture of things in 
21 here. 
22 But some reflect light, some don't. 
23 The previously described particles of foreign 
24 particulate matter are consistent with the products 
25 that are discharged from a barrel of a firearm.

1 That last statement is simply meaning 
2 that the things that I'm seeing under the scope in 
3 my opinion are being introduced into the hand as 
4 foreign material coming from another source. And 
5 that other source, in my opinion, what I'm seeing is 
6 consistent with coming from the barrel of a firearm, 
7 not being dirt introduced from another place, but 
8 specifically coming from something else due to the 
9 nature of the particles, how they're distributed in 
10 the skin, where they are distributed in the skin, 
11 and how they got into those particular levels. 
12 Q Dr. , you previously testified 
13 about how close the barrel or the muzzle or the end 
14 of the barrel of a firearm would need to be deposit 
15 those type of particulate or those products once the 
16 firearm is discharged. 
17 Can you give us an estimate or a 
18 range as to how far away the barrel would have been? 
19 A In my opinion, the range would be about 6 
20 to 9 inches away. 
21 Q Okay. Could, do you have a terminology 
22 that you use such as contact, close contact, medium 
23 range or something of that nature? 
24 A I would say this is consistent with a 
25 close range wound.

1 Q Okay. Now, contact wound that would be 
2 with someone actually, the barrel could possibly be 
3 touching the skin; is that right? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q Could you, if the barrel was touching the 
6 skin, would it look the same or different? 
7 A It would look different. 
8 Q Okay. And so, in your opinion, is it your 
9 opinion that the barrel of the gun was not touching 
10 the hand of Michael Brown if, in fact, one is to 
11 conclude that this is gunshot products from a gun? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
That the actual barrel of the gun would 
14 not have been up against the hand? 
15

Now, let's talk about one more finding 
17 that you made after you had testified previously. 
18 You were given something to examine that was 
19 described by our St. Louis County Crime Laboratory 
20 as skin or hardened nasal mucus?

it was. 
And what did you 
10 in order to determine what it was? 
do with that thing 
11 A So as I described to you all previously 
12 with those tissue fragments from Mr. Michael Brown's 
13 hand, that process of taking the fresh tissue, 
14 putting it in the formalin, putting it in the 
15 cassettes, sending it to SLU for processing, getting 
16 it sliced out of the paraffin block, put it on the 
17 microscopic slide, getting it stained and then 
18 coming back to me on a glass slide. That whole 
19 process happened again with this extra piece of 
20 tissue that I was given to look at independently.

22 any findings as to what that thing was?

25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 associated with some connective tissue, that's just 
2 supportive tissue beneath the skin layer. 
3 Q Can you tell where on the body that skin 
4 comes from? 
A Urn, not definitively. 5 
6 Q Okay. Do you have an educated guess or in 
7 your medical opinion, do you suspect it comes from 
8 one place as opposed to another? 
9 A Urn, I guess I'll preface it with this. 
10 Within a skin sample, there's a variety of cellular 
11 elements meaning different types of cells that are 
12 present within our bodies and, urn, at times there is 
13 a cell called melanocyte. It's our cell that's 
14 responsible for producing pigment. 
15 That particular cell when it makes 
16 its pigment, it kind of gives it away to another 
17 cell type, which is called a keratinocyte. In this 
18 particular cell at the junction between the dermis 
19 where I was telling you guys that connective tissue 
20 layer is, it's at the bottom part of the legitimate 
21 skin layer. 
22 These two cells are kind of in 
23 contact with each other and they communicate. So 
24 the melanocyte makes the pigment, gives it to the 
25 keratinocyte, which kind of absorbs it and then it

Page 34 
1 kind of allows skin to kind of display its pigmented 
2 characteristics. 
3 And the particular sample that I 
4 received to look at independently, there are 
5 keratinocytes there, but they are not picking up a 
6 lot of pigment. 
7 So in my personal opinion, this 
8 particular skin fragment has to be from an area of 
9 the skin that is not highly pigmented. There is a 
10 few places on the body, especially for someone whose 
11 skin is of a pigmented nature, where you can have a 
12 more likely pigmented type skin. 
13 And I'd like to show you, if you look 
14 on the back side of my hand here, if I looked under 
15 a scope on a piece of my skin under the microscope, 
16 I would see more pigmented keratinocytes present, 
17 but on this side of my hand it is more lightly 
18 pigmented, they are not going to be as prominent or 
19 being as significant. 
20 So saying all of that, the fact that 
21 that's specimen that I do have, there aren't a lot 
22 of pigmented keratinocytes. So I suppose that this 
23 fragment is coming from an area where the skin is 
24 lightly pigmented.

1 have once again the examination 2014-5413. You have 
2 the heading, Supplemental Microscopic Examination 
3 Report. 
4 Then you have Microscopic Slide 
5 Examination, and then you have the body of the 
6 paragraph where I preface by saying tissue fragment. 
7 And then I say sections of the tissue 
8 fragment from the exterior surface of the police 
9 officer's motor vehicle. I say that because that's 
10 where I knew where it came from, so I'm just trying 
11 to give it a description so that if someone looks at 
12 this later on, this kind of identifies where I got 
13 the tissue from and also helps to remind me where it 
14 came from. 
15 Are consistent with a fragment of 
16 skin overlying soft tissue and then I put in 
17 parentheses connective tissue. So when I'm looking 
18 at this particular fragment there is characteristics 
19 of cutaneous skin that let me know histologically 
20 that it is skin as opposed to something mucosal. 
21 When I say mucosal, like the inner side of your lip, 
22 that's an epithelial surface, meaning the outer 
23 layer of cells that surfaces a lining, but it is a 
24 different type of tissue being that it is mucosal. 
25 The difference between mucosal and

1 actual true skin, there's something called a 
2 granular layer. On the histology, and when I was 
3 talking about like the stratum corneum, you have the 
4 granular layer and you have another layer, you have 
5 a basilar layer. All of these things are kind of in 
6 a continuum. 
7 A granular layer is specific to skin 
8 that's on the outside of a body, it is not mucosal. 
9 So this particular fragment that I'm looking at has 
10 a granular layer. 
11 Since I see that, that let's me know 
12 that it is definitely exterior skin and that's how I 
13 know it's skin. And then the next part where it 
14 says overlying soft connective, the skin surface 
15 sits like on the level and beneath that you have a 
16 supporting layer of tissue. The supporting layer of 
17 tissue is this connective tissue layer that I'm 
18 talking about here. 
19 Then I say there are features of 
20 desiccation/drying artifact. This particular piece 
21 of tissue that I had that was, you know, was sitting 
22 outside on a car door for an extended period of time 
23 before, let me back up. 
24 Before I got a chance to put it in 
25 formalin, it has been exposed to air, other type of

1 things that can cause it to dry out, that's all 
2 desiccation means. It is kind of an artifactual 
3 change of it drying out, not being put in 
4 preservative, that would kind of halt or stop that 
5 process. 
6 So for an extended period of time, I 
7 don't know how long it took before it got to me, but 
8 those features are there, it is hardened, it dried. 
9 I can appreciate those changes under the microscope. 
10 Those changes under the microscope look like little 
11 circles or kind of like pockets of air, kind of 
12 looks like swish cheese, in a way to think how the 
13 little pockets of swish cheese are. That's cause 
14 the tissue has kind of been affected by these drying 
15 changes and causes that artifactual change on my 
16 slides, so that's what I'm talking about right 
17 there. 
18 Then I say there is a granular layer 
19 present within the upper layer of the stratified 
20 squamous epithelium. 
21 So that granular layer that I just 
22 spoke to you about, that's how I definitively know 
23 that this is a skin sample from the outer surface of 
24 the body skin surface. 
25 And the stratified squamous

1 epithelium is just how I as a pathologist describe 
2 this particular type of skin set. There is 
3 different types, but this particular type that you 
4 have on your skin is known as stratified squamous 
5 epithelium, so it is just a name. 
6 So focally, lightly pigmented 
7 keratinocytes are present within the basal layer of 
8 the stratified squamous epithelium. 
9 So that's just going back to what I 
10 was telling you before, you have that relationship 
11 between the melanocytes, who are responsible for 
12 making pigment. They give that pigment up to this 
13 keratinocyte, who holds onto it and eventually over 
14 time, you know, they will migrate up and disappear. 
15 But this particular cell type is not, 
16 it is present, but it is not overly pigmented. So 
17 it was important for me to describe that to maybe 
18 suggest potentially where this piece of tissue may 
19 have come from and that's what I'm saying in 
20 essence. 
21 Q Okay. I'm not even going to try to 
22 summarize that because I can't pronounce half the 
23 things you just said. I'm passing out copies of 
24 your two supplemental reports to the grand jurors

3 questions for Dr. ?

Q 
A 
Q 
(By Ms. Whirley) Hi, Dr. 
Hi, how you doing. 
Are you able to tell regarding the handle, 
7 how the injury occurred. For instance, whether he 
8 was grabbing the gun, shot went off and hurt his 
9 hand or if he was trying to block the weapon or stop 
10 him from shooting him, can you give any insight into 
11 that? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
No, I cannot. 
Why is that? 
Due to the nature of the wound, really all 
15 the information in my report is saying is that it is 
16 helping me with a distance. How far away this gun 
17 was discharged when this wound was generated. So 
18 other than the fact knowing it is a tangential graze 
19 wound and it is a wound of close range, I can't say 
20 any more about it because the information that I 
21 have, that's all it is telling me. 
22 I thought 
23 before, if you could remind us, do you know the 
24 direction in which the wound, the gunshot would have 
25 entered?

1 A So when I was telling you guys before 
2 there's, when you get, not all the time, but with 
3 graze wounds you can get injury called skin tags or 
4 you get these little projections of tissue that 
5 point a particular way. 
6 So in a situation for Mr. Michael 
7 Brown, the skin tags were going in an upward, let me 
8 back up. When I do my diagram, it is like this, 
9 anatomical position, you are like this. So with his 
10 wound --
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Would this help? This is a 
12 picture that I am using, which was taken during the 
13 autopsy and it is in the packet of Grand Jury 
14 Exhibit Number 7, and it is Image Number 49. If it 
15 is easier, you want me to turn the lights down? 
16 A Yeah. The tips of Mr. Michael Brown's 
17 fingers will be out here. That's my hand 
18 manipulating his hand. So those skin tags I'm 
19 talking about kind of look like little shark teeth, 
20 these are the little skin tags I'm talking about. 
21 These tags are pointing this direction, they're 
22 point that way. 
23 So the barrel of the gun points 
24 towards the tags. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: So let me do this. I'm

1 using my hand as a gun. So would the barrel be in 
2 this 
3 A The barrel is in that position and the 
4 bullet is going in that path just like that, that's 
the way it is going. (indicating) 5 
6 So when I put it on a body diagram, 
7 I'm like this. It's going in an upwards fashion. 
8 It doesn't mean it is going upwards, but that's the 
9 way that I have to present it to give a reference 
10 point of the injuries on a body diagram. 
11 But what it is saying in realtime is 
12 the hand can be positioned in all kind of fashions, 
13 but that gun barrel is going to have to stay like 
14 that. It has to be coming in a fashion like this. 
15 It can't change, it can't start coming this way, it 
16 can't. It has to always be in relationship like 
17 this. (indicating) 
18 Where the hand could have been like 
19 that generating the wound, the hand could have been 
20 like this generating the wound, and it could have 
21 been like this generating the wound, but they have 
22 to stay in this locked position, that's the only way 
23 it can be. (indicating) 
24 How long from the first 
25 examination to the further examination that you did,

1 how long of a time was it that you got those 
2 samples? You said you put them in a preservative 
3 liquid. 
4 A Uh-huh. 
5 Was there any 
6 deterioration or anything from the time when you 
7 received it until you did the second examination? 
8 
9 
A So in terms of processing that tissue, so 
I did the examination on August lOth. I immediately 
10 took samples, I cut little pieces out with scissors 
11 from kind of randomly around this area where it is 
12 kind of discolored. That's the area that I'm most 
13 suspicious for, concern for, for some type of 
14 particular matter or deposition of foreign material. 
15 I cut those out and immediately put 
16 them in preservative solution of the formalin as 
17 soon as I took them off that day. 
Okay. 18 
19 A Once they go in that solution, no more 
20 desiccation, nor more changing, nothing else is 
21 going to happen to it with the histology that I did 
22 of this wound. 
23 That other tissue didn't get a chance 
24 to go into formalin immediately. I don't know where 
25 it sat, it could have been in a cooler or an air

1 room temperature room, I don't know, but it didn't 
2 get into formalin until I got it until weeks later 
3 after the event occurred when it was given to me. 
4 That couldn't affect the 
5 way the particulates appear? 
6 A Just to make sure we are talking about the 
7 same specimen. For the things that I took here, 
8 once I put those into the solution, they are going 
9 to be preserved and nothing is going to be altered. 
10 Okay. That was the other 
11 thing, wasn't it, I'm sorry. 
12 A So once it goes into that tissue, I'm 
13 sorry, once it goes into that liquid, then goes to 
14 my histology lab and then, you know, through a 
15 series of steps before it gets put in that wax. 
16 So the tissue you got 
17 from the hand was preserved right away? 
18 A Correct. 
19 I just want to clarify 
20 because I understand you said it was sent to the

12 say soot, I know you can't verify that. I'm just 
13 going to call it that for right now. I know that we 
14 see that the hand, the hand palm is upright. 
15 Michael was almost 300 pounds and when he fell, 
16 could his hand have hit and moved and embedded dirt 
17 in there. Is there any way that that could be

1 A No problem. 
2 You said that you could 
3 tell that his hand wasn't on the barrel of the gun? 
4 A Yeah, I can't determine that though. 
5 You don't know that it 
6 was or you know that it wasn't? 
7 A On the information on my report, the 
8 information on my report is saying it is kind of a 
9 thing of static time. 
10 Okay. 
11 A Having the presence of that material,

20 9 inches when that wound was generated. 
21 But you cannot tell?

A That's all that I can say. 
Thank you so much. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And just let me clarify 
8 too, the tissue that was on the side of the police 
9 vehicle, did you see any of the particulate matter 
10 in that sample? 
11 
12 
A No, I did not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: When you examine the right 
13 hand and in particular the palm of Michael Brown and 
14 not just the wound, but the entire palm, did you see 
15 any dirt or debris on his, on the palm of his hand. 
16 A When I examined, the only area of 
17 discoloration that I was concerned of being 
18 something, I guess, not native to his hand was right 
19 here in this region. The rest of his hand is clean. 
20 You can see it is a normal palmer hand except when 
21 you get into this area associated with the wound. 
22 I do want to reiterate

1 flexibility in what you want to take, but standard 
2 specimens that I take on a full examination pretty 
3 much every time I always take some type of blood, I 
4 try to preface where it is coming from. I take 
5 urine and I also take vitreous fluids, which is 
6 fluid from the eyes, and I take liver and I take 
7 brain. 
8 I have to specifically tell the tox 
9 lab to test the brain and the liver if I'm concerned 
10 or worried about substances being in those organs. 
11 So for this particular case, the substances that 
12 were generated were active and metabolites of 
13 marijuana. 
14 Those particular things are found in 
15 the blood and it is not necessary to correlate them 
16 to the brain or the liver. The blood samples are 
17 going to give an accurate representation of the 
18 levels that were in his body at the time of his

1 possibility that, you know, it is conceivable. 
Page 51 
It 
2 is possible that the hand is in a certain position 
3 when something goes off. We know it is a graze 
4 wound, it didn't stay, so it had to go someplace. 
5 Could it have went into the door? Could it have 
6 reentered another area on his body? Could it have 
7 just went out into another place in space? All of 
8 those things are reasonable and I can't definitively 
9 say because I wasn't there to actually see the 
10 positioning of how the body was when it happened. 
11 It's possible, there is a multitude 
12 of ways that the bullet could have traveled after it 
13 struck the skin. 
14 Thank you. 
15 When I 
16 look at that wound, it looks to me there is a lot of 
17 tissue missing yet only one small piece of tissue 
18 was recovered. Is that maybe an illusion there is 
19 not a lot of tissue missing, more like where it 
20 opens up you could put it back? 
21 A That's a possible thing where it is kind 
22 of more like filet and just kind of split open. 
23 It's tracking deep, muscle is more, I guess, firm 
24 for lack of a better word. So the more firm, the 
25 more it is going to kind of split.

2 So it is hard to say that something, 
3 pieces get scattered around or whatnot, but from 
4 what you can see, there is definitely a track 
5 traveling through deeper into that muscle that you 
6 have. 
7 You feel your thumb right there, that

14 There would have been more

17 where the hand was positioned in space. It could 
18 have been in the car, it could have been outside the 
19 car, you can't. 
20 I guess no tissue was 
21 recovered in the car, that's what I was after, would

1 between it and pushed things to the side. It is 
2 just open like that because the muscle, that's just 
3 what muscle kind of does once it gets hit. Because 
4 your muscles are in a bundle, it is like a fascicle. 
5 You have tissue that kind of holds them together. 
6 So when you injure that, they just 
7 kind of fall out. So that is going to make a wound 
8 that may not necessarily be, you have a little small 
9 bullet, but it goes through and filets that stuffs 
10 open, the integrity of the tissue elements has been 
11 disrupted. So now things are going to be able to 
12 kind of flop out. You no longer have the skin 
13 holding things together, you don't have connective 
14 tissue holding muscle together, that stuff's 
15 disrupted, it is going to flop open. 
16 I'm also too, I'm putting traction on 
17 the hand too, and that's going to help to expose it 
18 more. You can see me pulling on his thumb, I mean 
19 your hand, your hand kind of just rest like this, 
20 I'm stretching it out like that. So that could make 
21 things look more dramatic than they really are.

1 question? 
2 A Yes, I recall his question and it is a 
3 good question. Urn, you know, I guess in my, I have 
4 to be honest with you guys, I have never been in a 
5 experience like this before. I've only been doing 
6 my craft, I guess on my own, for a little over two 
7 years. I haven't been involved in any really high

10 for me and I will always be learning throughout my 
11 life dealing with experiences and whatnot.

it could become what it is going to become. I was

21 I don't, you know, if there is little 
22 special things I'm concerned about. I pursue those, 
23 I do that, but I usually have the same approach 
24 every time.

1 come behind me, I've never had people come behind me 
2 before. I was a little nervous about it, but I know 
3 that I approach this in a logical fashion and I 
4 wouldn't have done anything different. 
5 So that being said, when people come 
6 behind you, the work that we do at the end of the 
7 day it is an opinion. There can be a difference of 
8 opinion, but as long as, you know, everyone, once 
9 everything is documented, you know, when someone 
10 says this is an end, this is an out. You know, this 
11 is an entrance wound, this is an exit wound. Well, 
12 this looks close range, blah, blah, blah. 
13 Once you get all of that kind of down 
14 on the table, you get all the facts out there, then 
15 at that point people start to say well, okay, this 
16 is what I think this is. 
17 Will somebody potentially look at my 
18 slides and say, oh, that's dirt, they can. But you 
19 have to understand is you have to, you can't look at 
20 these things in a vacuum, you know. 
21 Each piece is important for me not 
22 physically being there, I have the body, I have the 
23 evidence, I have to have all of these things to be 
24 able to generate my opinion. I think you have to 
25 look at everything in totality. You can't just take

1 a snapshot. You can do my job and do it in a vacuum 
2 and some come up with all kind of conclusions, but 
3 what you have to do is you have to look at 
4 everything and then you have to look at the person 
5 who was telling you, I mean, if the person is 
6 credible to you and like I say, I'm not here 
7 promoting one thing or another, I'm just speaking to 
8 the things that I observed. And for lack of a 
9 better term, regurgitating them back out with my 
10 level of medical training to try to make sense of 
11 everything. 
12 People can come in and say whatever 
13 they want to say for whatever their agenda is and I 
14 think people need to be aware of that. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: That brings up some good 
16 points that I wanted to maybe clarify with you. 
17 Have you, Doctor, ever performed a second 
18 autopsy? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
No, I have not. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And you said you've 
21 never had anybody perform a second autopsy after 
22 you? 
23 A No. 
24 Q Are you aware of what the proper protocol 
25 would be if a second autopsy would be performed

1 regarding what that second doctor may need in order 
2 to complete his findings, do you know? I don't want 
3 you to guess. 
4 A I have personal feelings about it what you 
5 may need, but I don't know is there a standard 
6 protocol, what someone is supposed to get when they 
7 do a second autopsy, I do not know the exact answer 
8 to that. 
9 Q Okay. So in your profession in your job, 
10 you were tasked with examining the body and 
11 determining the manner of death, the cause of death, 
12 and documenting and describing any defects or wounds 
13 of the body and testifying perhaps about the affects 
14 of those wounds and preparing a report which you did 
15 in this case? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q Now, you just said that when you went in 
18 on the lOth to do this autopsy, you approached this 
19 in the same manner that you would any autopsy that 
20 you are going to do; is that right? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
You didn't do this any differently because 
23 it was Michael Brown? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, I did not. 
Did you even know at that time you had

1 just said, you didn't know that this would become 
2 what it has become? 
3 A No, I did not. 
4 Q And are you familiar with Dr. , do 
5 you know him? 
6 A Yes, I do. 
7 Q Do you have an opinion as to whether or 
8 not he is a reputable or respected pathologist? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
I have no comment. 
Okay. How about have you seen a report 
11 from Dr. ? 
12 A I have not seen a report from him on this 
13 case. 
14 Q And now you're aware that there was a 
15 third autopsy done; is that right? 
16 A Yes, I am. 
17 Q That was done by Medical Examiners with 
18 the Department of Defense? 
A Correct. 
Q And you are aware that one of those 
19 
20 
21

doctors was Major , go you not? 
A Yes, I am.

When you met him, was it in relation to

Okay. And have you seen his report? 
No, I have not. 
Okay. So you can't today testify to any 
9 other findings by other professionals, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But you do recognize that very competent 
12 and reputable experts may differ in their opinions? 
13 A Correct.

15 opinion in this? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q All right. And we'll hear from Dr. 
18 and hopefully Dr. in the future. 
19 In order to do the things that I told 
20 you, you are tasked with doing in this case so that 
21 you testified, did you have to examine Officer 
22 Wilson's vehicle?

No.

20 clothing of Michael Brown; is that correct?

22 of the autopsy and then I gave it over to the St. 
23 Louis County Police Department as evidence.

X-rays of the body, correct. And we have

22 of anything.

24 gun that was used in the shooting, did you need to

14 Is the body cleaned in any 
15 way. 
16 A I mean --
17 Do you wash it down like 
18 with distilled or stabilized water. 
19 A The autopsy technician, like I said, doing 
20 the autopsy is not a totally clean process. You 
21 don't want to have blood all over the place from 
22 point of health hazards and visually esthetic 
23 purposes, it just doesn't look good. 
24 With water, the body is washed also 
25 so it is not all bloody and things of that nature.

Dr. 
Yeah. 
MS. ALIZADEH: In fact, I think, 
, if you recall from your previous 
18 testimony there's a series of photos that are taken 
19 before the body is washed and then there's a series 
20 of photos taken afterwards, and in cleaning parts of 
21 the body, is that so you can visualize the wounds 
22 and see what you are looking at?

1 actually an injury or wound? 
A Correct. 2 
3 Q Okay. And just also to clarify when you 
4 did your autopsy, the body of Michael Brown had not 
5 been embalmed or touched by a funeral director or 
6 anyone else, it came from the crime scene to be

1 Q And so in your job with the military, do 
2 you perform autopsies? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And do you perform autopsies and then 
5 prepare reports regarding your findings? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And have you testified in court regarding 
8 your findings after performing autopsies?

10 
A 
Q 
Yes, I have. 
And so in relation to this case, you know 
11 that you are here because you performed an autopsy 
12 on the remains of Michael Brown, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q When were you contacted, approximately, in 
15 order, when did you first learn that you were being 
16 asked to perform for an autopsy? 
17 A I believe August 18th was the day that we 
18 performed the autopsy, I know that. I think that 
19 was a Monday. I don't recall specifically, but I 
20 remember getting a call when I was at home from my 
21 boss. It was probably Sunday, the day before. 
22 Q Okay. And what did your boss tell you 
23 about what you were being asked to do? 
24 A Well, he said that the Department of 
25 Justice was making a special request from the

1 Department of Defense to perform an independent and 
2 non-biased autopsy on a civilian that had died in 
3 St. Louis. 
4 Q So was it unusual for you to perform an 
5 autopsy on civilians? 
6 A I would not say it is unusual for me to do 
7 autopsies on civilians. We perform autopsies on 
8 anyone that dies in federal jurisdictions as long as 
9 it's a medical examiner's case. If there's a 
10 civilian on a federal installation, we will be 
11 responsible for performing that post-mortem 
12 examination. 
13 Q So, for example, a serviceman, serviceman 
14 who maybe lives on base, his child dies and there is 
15 a need for an autopsy? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
That's a civilian, correct? 
Correct. 
Someone who may be, would be shot during a 
20 bank robbery, that would be a federal case, but that 
21 wouldn't necessarily be military, involved? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And so, so you were told that you 
24 were be requested by the Department of Justice to 
25 perform an independent and unbiased autopsy, is that

2 
3 
A 
Q 
Page 72 
Correct. 
Were you are told that the body had 
4 already been autopsy previous? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, I was. 
And did you, were you told that it had 
7 been autopsy twice? 
8 A Definitively it had been autopsy at least 
9 once before by the St. Louis County Medical 
10 Examiner's Office. There was some rumor at the time 
11 that a second independent autopsy had been 
12 performed, but we weren't sure at that time. 
13 Q Now, did, when you were notified about 
14 this, did they tell you who you were going to be 
15 autopsying? 
16 A At that time the name was given to me over 
17 the phone. 
18 Q Did they tell you it was going to be the 
19 body of Michael Brown? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
They did. 
And on August 18th, had you ever heard of 
22 Michael Brown? 
23 A In fact, I was ignorant. I'm not sure why 
24 I hadn't been watching media on this. I know there 
25 was a lot of coverage that I know now, at the time

1 this was the first I was hearing of it at that phone 
2 conversation that Sunday. 
3 Q So you had not viewed or at least had not 
4 made any connection between the media coverage 
5 regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown and 
6 the allegations that are being and were being made 
7 at the time with the autopsy that you were 
8 performing? 
9 A Correct, this was the first I was hearing 
10 of it. 
11 Q And so did you travel to St. Louis to 
12 perform the autopsy? 
13 A Yes, ma'am, I did. 
14 Q Did anyone come with you? 
15 A I was accompanied by one of our senior 
16 forensic pathologist was a Navy captain. He 
17 probably has 15 or 20 years experience named 
18 Dr. We performed the autopsy 
19 together and whenever we travel to do a case, we 
20 also bring one of our photographers. We have a 
21 staff of photographers that will accompany us when 
22 we go on road cases. So I had a photographer and 
23 Dr. accompany me. 
24 Q And so prior to doing the autopsy, did you 
25 learn anything additional that helped you to do the

1 autopsy? 
2 A So once we arrived at the Medical 
3 Examiner's Office, they welcomed us in, essentially 
4 gave us all access to the radiology, all the x-rays 
5 they had taken on the day that they performed their 
6 case, which I believe was the lOth of August. 
7 So before any gunshot wound case, we 
8 need to review the radiology in order to see what 
9 bony structures have been injured, if there are any 
10 projectiles in the body that need to be recovered. 
11 So this is standard procedure. 
12 So they gave me access to those 
13 x-rays and then I also was able to look at a small 
14 scene investigation synopsis probably a few 
15 paragraphs, I guess dating back to the 9th or lOth 
16 of August. So I had that information to review 
17 before we performed our, I guess, third autopsy. 
18 Q Do you recall what you learned from that 
19 scene synopsis? 
20 A It was just that there was an individual 
21 that had an altercation with a police officer and 
22 that he received multiple gunshot wounds and died at 
23 the scene. 
24 Q Did you have any information about, for 
25 example, whether or not there was an altercation at

1 or near a police vehicle?

3 
A It wasn't specified in what I had read. 
Q Okay. Did you have any information that 
4 there were perhaps conflicting reports about whether 
5 or not the individual was running or standing still 
6 or turning or what position his body was in? 
7 A I don't recall that being elaborated in 
8 that small synopsis, no. 
9 Q Okay. And so when you arrived at the 
10 Medical Examiner's Office in St. Louis County, did 
11 you speak with any of the medical examiners in St. 
12 Louis County? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. I spoke with Dr. right 
14 before we performed our own procedure and then 
15 afterwards, I spoke with Dr. 
16 Q So Dr. would be the chief medical 
17 examiner for St. Louis County? 
18 A To my knowledge, she is the chief at that 
19 office, yes, I believe so. 
20 Q All right. And did she give you any 
21 information that you felt was necessary in order for 
22 you to perform the autopsy? 
23 A She didn't provide any additional 
24 information before the autopsy itself. She was just 
25 there mostly to facilitate and make sure things were

1 going smoothly and she allowed us to actually use 
2 one of their own technicians to help with the case. 
3 Q Do you recall who that technician was? 
4 A I do not recall. I saw him in the 
5 photographs from the first autopsy, I don't recall 
6 his name. We have a full ledger in our own case 
7 file of everybody that was present in that room, 
8 which would include that technician as well as an 
9 FBI agent. 
10 Q And so the photographs that you mentioned 
11 that you saw from the first autopsy. 
12 A That is correct, but I did not get to see 
13 those until after we performed our own examination. 
14 Q Is that because they wouldn't allow you to 
15 see them, but you wanted to? 
16 A We actually prefer that we did not look at 
17 any photographs before completing our own autopsy. 
18 We felt like we were there to perform our own 
19 independent study. We didn't want to get biased by 
20 other photographs. 
21 Q All right. And when you arrived at the 
22 Medical Examiner's Office, I assume that the body 
23 was identified to you as the body of Michael Brown? 
24 A That is correct. He also had 
25 identification bracelets around his ankles and his

1 wrist that said Michael Brown. 
2 Q And did your photographer take photographs 
3 of the different stages of the autopsy? 
4 A Yes. We have a very specific protocol in 
5 the military in the way we deal with photographs and 
6 we performed our autopsy the same way we would as if 
7 it was a service member for a normal autopsy. 
8 When we arrive the body was 
9 discovered in several blankets. We take a 
10 photograph of that and then we removed those 
11 blankets and then we begin our standard photographs, 
12 which would include identification bracelets and 
13 anything else that could identify the body. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Are you looking for the 
15 other file? 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Sorry. 
17 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) For the record, we are 
18 using a disc that I've marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 
19 Number 79, and there are a number of photographs on 
20 this disc. And I'll ask you, Dr. if it is 
21 easier for you, and it might be, to maybe wheel that 
22 chair, you don't need to worry about the microphone 
23 picking you up, it will pick you up and you would be 
24 in a better position to look.

Yes, ma'am. 
Do you recognize this placard? 
I do. We use this placard on all of our 
11 autopsies, this is how we start all of the 
12 photography with this placard. And usually we make 
13 this at Dover Air Force Base before we go to the 
14 actual case.

Dr. 
Q 
A 
And the side of that placard says 
, St. Louis, Missouri? 
Correct. We were the two pathologists 
18 that were performing this autopsy. 
19 Q Okay. The date at the top, is that the 
20 date that you prepared the placard or the date that 
21 you actually performed the autopsy? 
22 
23 by 
A So this placard would have been prepared 
at the bottom, he's our photographer. I'm 
24 not sure if he did it the day before or the morning 
25 we flew out, but that was the day we performed the

So AFMES, what's that? 
Arm Force Medical Examiner System. That's 
4 where we work and we're stationed out of Dover Air 
5 Force Base. 
6 Q You have your own case number? 
7 A Correct. ME140240. 
8 Q Then you said MCCS , that's the 
9 photographer that you brought along with you? 
10 A Correct. I'm not in the Navy, so I don't 
11 know what MCCS stands for. He's a senior chief 
12 enlisted in the Navy. I'm not sure what that means. 
13 Q So you indicated that when you first 
14 arrived and the body was presented to you, it was 
15 wrapped in some blankets and that you took some, 
16 that your photographer took some pictures. 
17 There is, in this next image, Image 
18 Number 2, you can see something that's inside a 
19 blanket and there is a piece of paper perhaps that's 
20 on top of the blanket and that is your case number, 
21 correct? 
22 A Correct. We label all of our images no 
23 the matter what they are with a case number. I 
24 think that is just important for us to do not to 
25 misplace images across different autopsies.

1 Q This was all done at the Medical 
2 Examiner's Office here, correct? 
3 A Correct. This entire autopsy was done 
4 here, but these placards that we are seeing were 
5 things we had printed up before we arrived. 
6 Q Okay. So Image Number 3, and that is 
7 another different view of the body underneath the 
8 blankets? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Image Number 4. And so now in this image, 
11 we're seeing the lower half of the body and you 
12 indicated that there were bracelets, there is a 
13 green bracelet around the right hand and then there 
14 are bracelets around the ankles of the body. Did 
15 those identify the body as Michael Brown? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. I think we have closer up 
17 images that show his name actually written on these 
18 bracelets, but they did. 
19 Q And the next image. And then this is the 
20 upper half of his body; is that correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now just viewing this as we see it and as 
23 you saw it that day, can you tell by looking at it 
24 then that this body has been autopsied?

Yes, this is the standard Y incision that

1 we do in the United States and it has been sutured 
2 together. 
3 Q All right. And the next photo. Again, 
4 you indicated that you took close-up images of the 
5 actual identifying bracelets around the wrist and 
6 ankles s of the body, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And the next image and then the next, and 
9 the next, and then the next. Sorry, and so the last 
10 image we've already seen that image. So now we saw 
11 a number of images that you could see close up the 
12 bracelets that identified the body and now do you 
13 know why this image was taken? 
14 A Again, this is just our standard protocol. 
15 So at this point we would consider the body, usually 
16 the bodies that we are dealing with are actually 
17 still within the body bag, the human remains pouch. 
18 This is just a standard image. 
19 After we remove the blankets, 
20 whatever was underneath him, we will take pictures 
21 of him on the actual autopsy surface that we are 
22 going to be performing the case on. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So again, pretty much redundant 
25 information.

Q Okay. But these are different images? 
A They are, they are. We have already 
3 removed the blankets. 
4 Q All right. Now, this is an image of the 
5 lower half of his body, but he's turned over and 
6 he's lying on his stomach? 
7 A Correct. And you can see here some 
8 evidence of decomposition change, some skin 
9 slippage. 
10 Q And we see some discoloration on the, 
11 maybe I shouldn't characterize it as discoloration, 
12 you can see that there is definitely some different 
13 color to his skin, what's that caused by? 
14 A Correct. So the body has been embalmed, I 
15 think any images you may have seen up to this point 
16 have been from the first autopsy. So now, you know, 
17 eight days later, the body has been embalmed, been 
18 three, several other autopsies. So when the body's 
19 playing flat on the table getting embalmed, some of 
20 the embalming fluid may not reach these areas 
21 because the skin is pressed against a flat surface 
22 that prevents it from getting in. So I think any 
23 changes in tone or color is probably due to that. 
24 Q All right. So those aren't anything that 
25 you feel that were caused by the injuries that he

A 
Q 
No. 
And the next image? 
Page 83 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask him, what's the 
5 white. 
6 A This here? Skin slippage. It is 
7 decomposition. 
8 Again, the skin here isn't going to 
9 be as embalmed as the skin on the front. He's 
10 laying on his back, so this area could be prone to 
11 decomposition. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the embalming 
13 process is to slow down decomposition? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q And then you see the back of the upper 
16 half of his body. And you see some injuries to his 
17 body from that photograph; is that correct? 
18 A Correct. And this photograph we can see 
19 clearly, it is hard to tell from here, but that's 
20 the exit gunshot wound from a gunshot wound to his 
21 forearm. 
22 And then here is actually an autopsy 
23 artifact, that's where they had removed a bullet 
24 gunshot wound to the right lateral chest. That's 
25 where they recovered that round during the first

1 autopsy. 
2 Q Now, were you able to tell that just by 
3 looking at it? 
4 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Or did you have to examine it? 
This information I'm giving you is after I 
7 examined the entire case. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
I did not know at the time of first 
10 looking at his back that that was where they 
11 recovered a round from the first autopsy. 
12 Q And you weren't able to conclude that from 
13 the x-rays either? 
14 A No, because the x-rays, all we have is 
15 pretty much one dimension anterior and posterior, so 
16 it is hard to tell where exactly the bullet is. I 
17 only know it's in the right side of the chest 
18 somewhere, but in this situation, it was actually in 
19 the back. 
20 So you need x-rays from two different 
21 angles in order to really tell that, which we didn't 
22 have. 
23 Q All right. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: There's no indication that 
25 he was shot in his back?

No, I would not at any point thought that 
2 was a gunshot wound. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) The next slide, is this 
4 a repetition of the previous, of a previous slide 
5 we've seen?

13 
Q 
A 
I'm not sure why we are looking at this 
Okay. 
Just closer up image of the same thing, 
14 this is that defect that they created during the 
15 first autopsy to remove that round. 
16 Q And you learned that after your autopsy? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q But looking at that, you can say that that 
19 is not an entrance wound, a gunshot entrance wound? 
20 A That is correct. And there is no evidence 
21 here of any, what we would say a sign of life. 
22 There is no vital reaction here, there is no blood, 
23 there is no inflammation around these edges, this 
24 looks like a post-mortem phenomenon and that's what 
25 it is.

Q 
A 
Page 86 
All right. Is that a closer up of the 
Correct. As you get closer you can 
3 actually see a scalpel injury here, it's all 
4 post-mortem, it is where they removed it. 
5 Q And the next image. Describe what this 
6 photograph shows? 
7 A So this is the right hand, we are looking 
8 at the palm surface and this is a tangential gunshot 
9 wound to the base of the right thumb. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
And what do you mean tangential? 
Meaning if the skin surface is like this, 
12 the bullet is kind of going in the same direction as 
13 the skin at that point. So it is basically, you've 
14 heard the term graze, I'm sure. I would beg to 
15 differ this is a little deeper. When I think graze, 
16 I think of something very close to the surface of 
17 the skin only, which we will see later in this case. 
18 But I think this would be, I prefer to call it 
19 tangential gunshot wound, meaning the bullet was 
20 kind of going in the same direction as the skin at 
21 that point. 
22 Q Now, you were just showing with your hand, 
23 you had your, at this point can you tell by looking 
24 at this the direction, if this injury was caused by 
25 a bullet, can you tell the direction the bullet was

1 traveling? 
2 A It is difficult in this image because we 
3 have to orient it differently. You will see through 
4 different photographs there are skin tags and that 
5 is what we use to tell the direction of fire in a 
6 tangential gunshot wound. In this image I would 
7 have a hard time telling. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Again, this image can't help a whole lot. 
10 You can see a little bit of skin tag kind of 
11 pointing in this direction and one on this side 
12 also. This still a little difficult based on this 
13 image. 
14 You will also have to keep in mind, 
15 again, the body has been embalmed. So as the skin 
16 starts to get tighter, it starts to change compared 
17 to first autopsy. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
Have you ever done a second autopsy? 
In fact, we do a lot of second autopsies 
20 at Dover Air Force Base. A lot of the civilians 
21 that die overseas, they are going to get autopsies 
22 in sovereign countries and then they are going to 
23 come back to Dover and do a second autopsy, so we 
24 see a lot of these.

1 to the right hand and there is a scale that is 
2 placed over the wound to give it perspective, is 
3 that fair to say? 
4 A Exactly. We do this for any gunshot 
5 wound, that is standard. You can start to see 
6 another tag coming into the field here again, it 
7 starts to point in that direction, not as good as I 
8 would like. 
9 Q All right. And the next image? 
10 A So in this image we have the posterior 
11 surface, an anatomic position, this is actually the 
12 anterior surface. I'm sure this has been 
13 demonstrated, right? So anatomic position is like 
14 this, standing straight ahead, palms facing forward. 
15 Okay. 
16 This is actually confusingly the 
17 anterior surface of the right forearm and that's an 
18 exit gunshot wound right there. 
19 We can also see that tangential 
20 gunshot wound to the thumb also in this image. 
21 
22 
Q 
A

Is just close-up image here of the exit 
23 wound on the anterior surface of right forearm.

Here we are moving up a little bit closer

1 into the axilla. Basically still on his back and we 
2 are taking a picture here of the back of his arm 
3 here close to his armpit. So this is actually an 
4 exit gunshot wound. If I hold my arm out like this, 
5 it is right about in this location here. 
6 (indicating) 
7 Q Now, let me ask you, Dr. , is there 
8 any, this may sound silly for me to ask you this, is 
9 there any rhyme or reason as to the order which you 
10 document and photograph wounds? 
11 A There is, a lot of it's mechanics, right. 
12 Michael Brown wasn't a light person, you know, he 
13 was probably well over 250 pounds. It is difficult 
14 for us to continuously manipulate and turn him from 
15 front to back. 
16 So we try to take all the photographs 
17 when he is laying on the stomach, then flip him over 
18 and then take all the photographs from the other 
19 side. 
20 Q So when you talk about these wounds, we 
21 will see in your report later you might have them as 
22 numbered, or in this case the first wound you 
23 photographed and the second one you photographed, is 
24 there any, are you saying that those were the order 
25 in which the wounds were sustained?

1 A No, I'm not. This has nothing to do with 
2 the order of infliction of these wounds. This is 
3 just the order that we happen to photograph them at 
4 autopsy. 
5 Q All right. So you said that this is on 
6 the back, upper arm and that is an exit wound?

9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And is this a gunshot wound? 
Correct, this is an exit gunshot wound. 
And then the next photograph? 
Just a closer up image of the same thing. 
And the next photograph? 
Okay. So now he's still laying on his 
14 stomach and now we have an image of the left forearm 
15 and we can see an injury here. I think if you go on 
16 we can actually get a better picture of that. 
17 Perhaps, okay, a little bit better here. 
18 So we actually call this a 
19 superficial incised wound. In our opinion, a sharp 
20 force injury, it is not blunt. 
21 Whatever caused this was something 
22 sharp, like a piece of glass, a piece of jagged 
23 metal, a knife, something like that, something 
24 sharp. The way that we can tell that is the edges 
25 of this are very clean. We don't see any abrasion

1 along it. 
2 I think what you see here that is 
3 kind of dark along the edge of this is actually some 
4 vital reaction, he is getting a little inflammation 
5 from it. It doesn't take long for a wound to become 
6 inflamed. I think that is what we are seeing here. 
7 And again, it is a little dry, it is 
8 eight days later, he has been embalmed, so it is a 
9 little different than it would look during the first 
10 autopsy. 
11 And then along the same trajectory 
12 right here, you can pick up kind of a faint scratch 
13 along with it. So again, this is consistent, in our 
14 opinion, with something sharp. 
15 Q All right. So in your opinion, you have 
16 said a couple of times in our opinion. 
17 So are you performing the autopsy 
18 
19 
together with Dr. ? 
A That is correct. We performed this 
20 autopsy together. 
21 Q And do you talk about your beliefs and 
22 findings as you are performing the autopsy?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Since Dr. is not here to testify. 
Yes. 
And let me just ask you, was there ever 
11 any difference of opinion between you and 
12 Dr. in your autopsy and your findings in 
13 this case? 
14 A There was not. 
15 Q Okay. All right. So if you continue to 
16 say our opinion, it is also your opinion as well. 
17 A That is correct. I can change and say my 
18 opinion. 
19 Q Okay. So now in this wound you said you 
20 think this was caused by a sharp object? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
23 a bullet? 
24 A 
I do. 
You don't think that that could have been 
I do not. This does not look like a graze 
25 gunshot wound to me. Again, I know we use the word

1 clean, I know that is kind of subjective. It is a 
2 little hard to fine, but when I say clean, I mean 
3 the edges of this are very straight, there is not a 
4 lot of abrasion to it. 
5 A gunshot wound is going to create a 
6 lot of abrasion, it's going to look for all intents 
7 and purposes a lot slopier, it is not going to look 
8 like that. 
9 Q And to kind of jump ahead a little bit 
10 here. After your autopsy, did you have a chance to 
review Dr. report? 
A I did once we completed our autopsy. We 
11 
12 
13 actually sat down with Dr. , Dr. 
14 Dr. and our photographer at a table and we 
15 reviewed all the images from the first autopsy. It 
16 was at that point he also gave us his autopsy 
17 report, which may have been preliminary at that 
18 time, but actually I think it was finalized. 
19 
20 Dr. 
Q Regarding this particular wound, you and 
disagree about what might have caused 
21 that wound; is that correct? 
22 A Correct. Dr. , he may have called 
23 this abrasion. In my opinion an abrasion is 
24 superficial. It's basically the very most outer 
25 layer of the skin is just kind of worn away and it

1 is a blunt force injury. It is either your body 
2 impact a blunt object like a baseball bat or 
3 something flat or blunt object impact your body. 
4 That is what an abrasion is, it is very superficial. 
5 This is deeper, it goes through the 
6 outer layers of skin. You can actually start to see 
7 a little bit of the deeper dermis and the 
8 subcutaneous tissue within that wound. 
9 The only other thing that would be on 
10 differential for this is a laceration, which is also 
11 a blunt force injury. We see them all the time in 
12 contact sports, people that get hit in boxing, they 
13 get lacerations, the skin rips. 
14 Again, I think this is a sharp force 
15 injury, a superficial incised wound. 
16 Q Now, let me ask you then, Dr. in 
17 your experience as a pathologist for the military, I 
18 would imagine you have seen performed a number of 
19 autopsies on servicemen who were killed by IUD's? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
22 forth? 
23 A 
24 Q 
Correct. 
And they have like shrapnel injures and so 
Correct. 
A shrapnel injury, would that be something 
25 like you would have a piece of metal or some other

Page 95 
1 hard object that would injure the skin or injure the 
2 tissue? 
3 A Correct, it can injure the body in a great 
4 number of ways. If you want to call shrapnel 
5 injuries, we would call them blast fragment 
6 injuries. They can actually look like gunshot 
7 wounds, but depending on the velocity and size of 
8 the fragment, it can also cause lacerations. I 
9 would not call them sharp force injuries if they 
10 impacted the body. 
11 Q Okay. So you don't think the bullet 
12 grazing the surface of skin could cause that injury?

17 
that 
A 
Q 
Dr. 
A 
Q 
That is 
Okay. 
I did. 
And I'm 
not my opinion. 
Did you look at the photographs 
has taken of this injury? 
just wondering because we've 
18 talked earlier and Dr. has testified, of 
19 course, before about that experts can differ in 
20 their opinions. Did anything about the photographs 
21 that Dr. had taken change your opinion 
22 about the cause of what caused this injury? 
23 A No, in fact, his photographs reinforced 
24 what I thought. I still believe this is a sharp 
25 force injury with his photographs and in addition to

1 ours. 
2 Q Did you discuss with Dr. that you 
3 had a difference of opinion in regard to this 
4 injury? 
5 A We had talked about it, yes. But he 
6 wasn't swayed one way or another. 
7 Q And you weren't swayed either to change 
8 your opinion? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No. 
All right. And so could a piece of glass 
11 could have caused this injury, yes. I believe a 
12 piece of glass could have caused that injury? 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: The only question I have is 
14 that this injury you believe happen 
15 contemporaneously with the gunshot injury? 
16 A I do, especially if you look at the first, 
17 the first autopsy images of this injury. It looks 
18 very acute, it doesn't have any signs of healing. 
19 It has a little bit of inflammation around the 
20 border, it is still wide open and it is bleeding. I 
21 would think that if that injury had occurred in the 
22 past it would have potentially have been treated in 
23 some way, a bandage or something, that is a pretty 
24 large wound to leave open.

1 is the back side of what side, left or right? 
A This is the left arm. 2 
3 This is the left arm? 
4 A Correct. It would be like right here. 
5 Oh, so it is right here. 
6 So could that have happened against a metal car 
7 rubbing up against the window? 
8 A I believe so, as long as whatever impacted 
9 his arm at that point was a sharp object, jagged 
10 metal, glass, yes. 
11 Okay. 
12 What a 
13 about fingernail? 
14 A Fingernail, no. Fingernail injury we 
15 would term abrasions. It would have to be an 
16 extraordinarily filed and sharp fingernail to cause 
17 that injury. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: You know, I appreciate as 
19 we move along, rather than save your questions just 
20 butt in because while we have a slide up, it makes 
21 sense for you to raise those questions for the 
22 doctor as we go along.

1 the left hand here. At this point you saw in the 
2 last image we flipped his body back over and I think 
3 what is becoming apparent here is a small abrasion 
4 here kind of at the base of the wrist. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So you describe this as 
6 an abrasion? 
7 A Correct. An abrasion meaning it is a 
8 blunt force injury, either the hand impacted a blunt 
9 object or the blunt object impacted the hand. And 
10 it eroded away some of the superficial layers of 
11 skin leaving that. 
12 Q Could that injury have been caused by a 
13 bullet? 
14 A No, it is not my opinion that could be 
15 caused by a bullet. 
16 Q 
17 abrasion? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
A 
You can't say what object then caused that 
I cannot. 
MS. WHIRLEY: A fingernail? 
Fingernail abrasions usually, we call them 
21 curve linear, they are basically a little U shaped 
22 abrasions. I don't think that that's a fingernail 
23 injury. 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. WHIRLEY: Someone grabbing, holding? 
Potentially, but again, I cannot look at 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

1 that and tell you what caused it. 
2 
3 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
A bracelet? 
November 6, 20 14 
Page 99 
4 A A bracelet potentially, yeah, a bracelet 
5 could do it, that's one possibility. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Would the bracelet have to 
7 have been a hard object? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A It depends on how the injury occurred. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, all right. 
A I can't add any more to that. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you this. We 
12 see a bracelet now on the right hand, was there an 
13 identifying bracelet on the left hand? 
14 A I don't recall there being one on the left 
15 hand, no. But I know that it is not a postmortem 
16 abrasion because we can see that same abrasion on 
17 the autopsy photographs in the first case and there 
18 wasn't that bracelet there yet. 
19 So in this image here now we can see 
20 entrance gunshot wound to the right forearm and that 
21 couples with the exit gunshot wound that we saw on 
22 the anterior surface of the right forearm in 
23 previous images. 
24 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And so this wound have 
25 been, entrance wound would have been on the other

Page 100 
1 side of his forearm, correct? 
2 A Correct. This is the entrance wound for 
3 this gunshot wound, and we saw the exit wound when 
4 he was laying on his stomach and that was on the 
5 right forearm in this location on the anterior 
6 surface. 
7 Q And I just lost what I was going to say. 
8 Looking at the x-rays of his extremities, were you 
9 able to tell if this gunshot wound impacted any 
10 bone? 
11 A Correct. The right ulna was fractured and 
12 we picked that up on x-ray. 
13 Q And was that fracture consistent with a 
14 bullet passing through his forearm? 
15 A It was 100 percent consistent with a 
16 bullet trajectory with an entrance wound here and an 
17 exit wound here, going through the right ulna. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Two things. One is this 
19 wound consistent with being, with him being shot 
20 from behind, you understand what I'm saying? If 
21 someone is pursuing him and shooting, is that wound 
22 consistent with receiving that shot in that way? 
23 A Right, obviously, a difficult question to 
24 answer because as you know, our arms can do all 
25 sorts of things in three dimensional space. And, 
FAX 314-241-6750

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XX November 6, 20 14 
Page 101 
1 you know, the shooter versus who is receiving the 
2 bullets, it also depends on where they are in three 
3 dimensional space. 
4 So if you are asking me could a shot 
5 from his backside produce that, I say yes. Because 
6 as you are running, if your arm is down like this, 
7 that surface, that very surface of your arm is 
8 exposed posteriorly. So a bullet coming from behind 
9 you could cause that injury. 
10 Could it come from the front side? 
11 Yes, depending on how your arm is. If your arm is 
12 out in front of you like this, a bullet impacting 
13 here could still exit here. 
14 If your arms are up like this, they 
15 have to be rotated in order for the bullet to impact 
16 here if the shooter is directly ahead of you. It's 
17 difficult, but I think there is a lot of different 
18 scenarios that can explain that trajectory. 
19 (indicating) 
20 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the last posture that 
21 you demonstrated with your arms above your head. 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
You said you believe your palms would have 
24 to be rotated? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XX November 6, 20 14 
Page 102 
1 Q So I can describe for the record, you had 
2 your palms facing each other? 
3 A Correct. If my palms face outward like 
4 this, that part of the arm is starting to go 
5 lateral. The shooter in my opinion if you are 
6 facing like this would have to be at that angle. In 
7 order to go through your arm here and exit here. It 
8 is kind of going leftward, right. If your arms are 
9 up like this. If you rotate in, then the bullet can 
10 come more face on. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: And that's assuming that the 
12 shooter is right in front of you? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: If the shooter is diagonal 
15 to you? 
16 A If the shooter is diagonal, right, then I 
17 believe your palms can be facing forward, but you 
18 are not directly whoever is shooting you at that 
19 point. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And this is the right arm, 
correct? 
A This is his right forearm. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So if the shooter were

MS. WHIRLEY: Ready? 1 
2 A Just a close-up image of the entrance 
3 gunshot wound to the right forearm. Just some 
4 pertinent negatives that we see here, we don't see 
5 any close range discharge of a firearm, any evidence 
6 of that. 
7 When I say that, that means 
8 stippling, which is essentially impact with the skin 
9 with burning and unburned gunpowder particles. We 
10 don't see any soot, which is a product of combustion 
11 of the gunpowder, we don't see any deposition of 
12 that. 
13 I don't see any searing or muzzle 
14 imprint that would have occurred if a gun was right 
15 
16 
up against that forearm. So no evidence of that. 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And just to jump ahead a 
17 bit so you're not repetitious. We will talk about 
18 the hand injury separately, but other than the hand 
19 injury, were any of the other gunshot wounds in your 
20 opinion, did you observe any soot or stippling on 
21 any of those other injuries? 
22 A On none of the other injuries did we see 
23 any soot, stippling or unburned gunpowder particles. 
24 No evidence of close range discharge of a firearm on 
25 any of these gunshot wounds except for the one you

1 had just mentioned on the hand. 
2 And again, we have to preface that by 
3 saying I did not have the clothing to inspect at the 
4 time of this autopsy. And furthermore, this could 
5 have been the third autopsy, the body has been 
6 embalmed, washed several times. A lot of that stuff 
7 can start to wash away. Stippling doesn't, but soot 
8 can. 
9 And the other thing to say is the 
10 gunshot wound to the top of the head, Michael Brown 
11 had pretty thick hair. So a lot of times hair can 
12 actually prevent deposition of soot, stippling. 
13 Q Okay. Can you describe this injury, this 
14 wound? 
15 A This here is an entrance gunshot wound to 
16 the upper right arm. We saw the exit wound earlier 
17 that was closer to the armpit. So this entrance 
18 wound was here on the right lateral arm and the exit 
19 was under the arm here by the armpit area. 
20 And again, just a close-up image of 
21 the same.

Q 
A 
Next image? 
Okay. So we have two things we can talk 
24 about here. One is an entrance wound, gunshot

1 is a gunshot exit wound on the right chin. 
Q All right. 2 
3 A Again, close-up image here of the entrance 
4 gunshot wound to the right clavicle area. 
5 So here we have two things we can 
6 talk about. This is a graze wound, a graze gunshot 
7 wound on right forearm, excuse me, right upper arm, 
8 that's basically in the bicep area. That would be 
9 about here on my arm. 
10 This here is just another angle on 
11 that entrance gunshot wound to the upper right arm. 
12 (indicating) 
13 Q Can you tell anything from that graze 
14 injury that you are circling right now about the 
15 direction of travel of the bullet? 
16 A So we cannot, I cannot. We talked about 
17 earlier with that thumb wound, a lot of the ways 
18 that we can tell trajectory on some superficial like 
19 this is with the skin tags. Well, you guys can see 
20 just as well as I do there are no skin tags here. 
21 Sometimes we can start to guess by 
22 the direction of the abrasions. We don't really 
23 have anything that I can go on here to tell the 
24 trajectory of this fire. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
All right. And the next image?

1 A Just a close-up image of the same here. 
2 And some of what you are seeing here is drying 
3 artifact. Again, the body has been now deceased for 
4 a number of days and embalmed. It is starting to 
5 take on a more black color, which is not uncommon 
6 for these gunshot wounds. 
7 Q And the next, this image is just a more 
8 distant image of that grazing wound that you just 
9 spoke of? 
10 A Agreed, and then there's that entrance 
11 gunshot wound again on the upper right arm. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
All right. 
A picture here of his tattoos. Another 
14 shot here of the exit gunshot wound on the right 
15 side of the chin here and coming into the field here 
16 also are abrasions. Now, a little more dry 
17 appearing than what they were eight days prior. 
18 The exit wound 
19 you were speaking of, were you able to determine 
20 what entrance wound? 
21 A Coupled with that exit? 
22 Was it this one on the 
23 chest? 
24 A Oh, okay. So this is the exit wound for a 
25 gunshot wound that was on the forehead. And right

1 here on the right clavicle area was another entrance 
2 gunshot. So I guess we haven't talked about that. 
3 So the total amount of the gunshot 
4 wounds in this case is eight. There is eight 
5 separate gunshot wounds. 
6 Now, the possibility exist that the 
7 gunshot wound to the right clavicle and the gunshot 
8 right lateral chest could be reentry gunshot wounds. 
9 The gunshot wound to the arm or the gunshot wound to 
10 the forehead. It is my opinion that entrance wound 
11 here on the right clavicle is likely a reentry wound 
12 from that exit right there on right chin because the 
13 trajectories line up perfectly. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And then regarding the 
15 entrance wound on the chest being a reentry of a 
16 gunshot wound to the forearm, would that all just 
17 depend on how that forearm was positioned when the 
18 bullet passed through it? 
19 A Correct. This gunshot wound on the upper 
20 right arm, which we've seen and then the exit was 
21 here, under the axilla basically. I have a hard 
22 time with that one coming from my body and causing 
23 this entrance gunshot wound to the right lateral 
24 chest, which we actually have not seen a picture of 
25 yet. The trajectory doesn't make sense in my mind.

1 The arm would have to be pretty up 
2 and over across the chest in order to come back, 
3 because that's where they got the bullet. It 
4 entered here and recovered it down here on the right 
5 lower flank. It is challenging, but the forearm one 
6 I do think could line up with that lateral chest if 
7 it was out like this. (indicating) 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
All right. And this is also that wound 
This is the exit wound on the jawline 
10 there on the right side of the face. 
11 Question, Dr. 
12 
13 
14 
A Yes. 
In order for a bullet to 
15 enter twice, go in, come out and enter, do you have 
16 to be close or far away for that to happen? 
17 A You do not, no. It is really going to 
18 depend on the type of weapon, the type of ammunition 
19 and what structures the bullet hits as it goes 
20 through the body. It's a very complicated question. 
21 But at this range, I'm actually not sure what weapon 
22 was used and I do not know the caliber. I can't 
23 really comment any further on that.

1 injuries to the right eye and above the eye? 
2 A Correct. So now we can see the entrance 
3 wound that was on the forehead here. It is a little 
4 bit to the right of the midline. 
5 This gunshot wound actually caused 
6 these lacerations both here to the right eyebrow and 
7 to the upper right eyelid here as it passed 
8 underneath of it. It also ruptured the right eye. 
9 I didn't even see it at the time of our autopsy. It 
10 was essentially obliterated. 
11 It fractured several bones in the 
12 
13 
face and then it exited right here. (indicating) 
Q And that is a bullet that you said 
14 possibly could have then reentered the clavicle 
15 area? 
16 A Correct. So minimum number of gunshot 
17 wounds is six in this case and then eight total 
18 depending on whether or not you believe these are 
19 reentry wounds, you can drop the total number of 
20 gunshot wounds to six. Again, just a closer up 
21 image.

23 about gunshot wounds, if each wound is separate.

1 heard about other possible opinions. So how many 
2 total gunshots wound were on Michael Brown's body? 
3 A If you want to count entrance and exist 
4 separately? 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Right. 
See, I haven't been doing that. When I 
7 say eight total gunshots wounds, I just mean 
8 basically eight bullets went through his body. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
If you want to drop the number to six 
11 total bullets went through his body, you would have 
12 to consider this and these two injuries on the right 
13 chest as reentry wounds. 
14 Q Okay. I didn't want there to be some 
15 confusion that you thought there were only eight 
16 wounds on the body that were caused by a bullet. 
17 A No. 
18 Q Okay. All right. So the next slide we 
19 see is another image of the entry wound in the 
20 forehead; is that right? 
21 A That's correct. This is a closer up image 
22 of that. 
23 Q And again, you do not believe that this 
24 was a close contact wound? 
25 A

I do not. There would have been,

1 obviously, in this situation no clothing over the 
2 body. He wasn't wearing a hat, his hair wasn't 
3 here, we see no stippling, no soot, no muzzle 
4 imprint, no searing of his skin, no evidence. 
5 Q This bullet would have traveled downward 
6 through the eye and then exited out the jaw? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And so given that Michael Brown was about 
9 6'5", the bullet would of had to have entered and 
10 traveled downward, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So the barrel of the gun would have to 
13 have been above, when I say above, it had to enter 
14 from this direction, correct? (indicating) 
15 A Correct. Again, it is difficult with 
16 trajectories. We have to imagine, there is a lot of 
17 different scenarios to explain this trajectory. 
18 Yes, if you just look at it in anatomic position, it 
19 goes sharply downward to the right and a little bit 
20 backward. I can manipulate my head in all sorts of 
21 ways in three dimensional space where the shooter, 
22 if we don't know where he is, there is a lot of 
23 different ways to get that wound. 
24 So we don't know anything 
25 whether or not he was falling or whether he bent

1 over to charge or whether he was just bending? 
2 A Correct, yeah. I can't tell you from this 
3 what he was doing, that's correct. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. The next slide. 
5 A Okay. So here they're just taking a more 
6 close-up image of the skin lacerations that were the 
7 result of that entrance gunshot wound. So again 
8 here, eyelid and eyebrow. 
9 Q But those were caused by the bullet 
10 passing through? 
A Correct. 
Q That's not like a blunt force? 
11 
12 
13 A We don't have any reason to suspect these 
14 are separate injuries. We believe, I believe that 
15 they were caused by that single gunshot wound to the 
16 forehead. 
17 Q Okay. Next one? 
18 A So left hand, we just noticed a few 
19 defects here, some small abrasions. Dr. 
20 also mentioned some possible abrasions, I think he 
21 calls them postmortem at times. Bottom line, I 
22 wouldn't make a big deal of these abrasions. They 
23 could have been there before. 
24 I have a question going 
25 back to the one in the head. I just want to make

1 sure that I understand. Would it have been 
2 possible, from what I'm reading, you're not 
3 indicating that somebody was standing over here, 
4 that's not indicated or standing over him at a close 
5 range? 
6 A That's possible. When we say close range, 
7 it still did not deposit any evidence of close range 
8 discharge on 
9 So not as close as we 
10 are? 
A Not as close as we are. That's a whole 11 
12 another topic. I don't know if we want to get into 
13 that, you may have already addressed it, you know, 
14 at what distance does this stuff still deposit onto 
15 the skin. And I can just give a ballpark average, 
16 I'm not a ballistics expert, but with a standard 
17 handgun, it's about 2 feet to still get stippling 
18 and then within a foot you can get soot. 
19 So if I'm two feet away from you with 
20 a standard handgun, standard ammunition, you are not 
21 going to have any evidence of close range discharge. 
22 So having said that, this 
23 is 12. It is at least 2 feet away? 
24 A Ballpark, yes, 2 feet away. But the 
25 weapon needs to be test fired with the exact same

2 I understand. That's an 
3 educated guess. 
4 A Educated guess I would say greater than 
5 2 feet. 
6 Okay. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. The next image? 
8 A So just a closer up image here, small 
9 discoloration here and then an abrasion there. 
10 Again, I cannot tell you what caused that and I 
11 really wouldn't put much significance into it. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And the abrasion, you can't 
13 even say if it was contemporaneous with the 
14 shooting. 
15 A I cannot. I would have to re-review all 
16 the images from the first autopsy again. I remember 
17 seeing some of these abrasions there, but I believe 
18 Dr. called them postmortem, which it is 
19 possible. Once the body is down on the ground, it 
20 is being manipulated and put in a body bag, 
21 abrasions can still occur.

No, a lot of the fingernail abrasions that

18 hand here and again, some small defects, a little 
19 abrasion here and there. I really, again, I cannot 
20 tell you what caused them, just small abrasions.

1 the right lateral chest and this is where they 
2 recovered that round that we saw that defect from 
3 the prior autopsy. It is basically going front to 
4 back and a little bit downward. 
5 And while it goes through this 
6 course, it doesn't actually enter the chest cavity, 
7 but it fractures the eighth rib and a splinter of 
8 that bone actually injured the right lung on the 
9 lower lobe. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) This is a gunshot wound 
11 from the front? 
12 A Correct, correct. Here is your entrance 
13 here and this is where the round was recovered. 
14 Q And in this image, because we can't see 
15 the hands or feet of the body, where is his head?

1 wouldn't disable him. 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) If someone received that 
3 wound, could they run 25 feet? 
4 A Yes, yes. Again, another image here. We 
5 kind of put his arm back and you can see his armpit 
6 and again entrance gunshot wound here, and that is 
7 where they recovered that round. 
8 Just because we haven't mentioned it 
9 yet, we haven't really described that other wound 
10 here on the right clavicle. What it did on the 
11 inside he had about 400 milliliters of blood in his 
12 right chest cavity. That's about like a can of 
13 Coke. A can of Coke is about 350 milliliters, so a 
14 decent amount of blood in his right chest. 
15 And again, this fractured a rib that 
16 caused injury to the lung and that gunshot wound to 
17 the right clavicle area fractured the clavicle and 
18 then it went right through the upper lobe of the 
19 right lung. So quite a bit of injury to the right 
20 side of his chest. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: We're going to ask the same 
22 question. If someone received those injuries that 
23 then injured his lung, would that immediately

1 but also that the bullet entered the lobe of right 
2 lung? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q And there was a significant amount of 
5 blood from that, which I imagine you did not see in 
6 your autopsy? 
7 A Of course, that's correct. A lot of these 
8 things that I'm telling you I could not tell from 
9 our autopsy. We actually had to go back and look at 
10 Dr. report and his images. And that's 
11 because, as you can imagine, after the autopsy, all 
12 of these organs have been dissected and they're 
13 dissected again on a second autopsy. And they're 
14 put in a bag and they are in the abdominal cavity 
15 after embalming. 
16 So we basically just have a bag of 
17 organs to look at. We lay them all out, we do our 
18 best, but it can be challenging to interpret gunshot 
19 wounds at that point. 
20 Q If the lung was injured in two different 
21 places at that point, could a person scream loudly? 
22 A Yes, I see no reason why a person couldn't 
23 scream loudly.

25 gunshots wounds, correct?

A Correct. 1 
2 Q Even a person with one lung can speak, can 
3 yell and scream, correct? 
4 A Correct. 
5 But a 
6 person of that size where only one chest cavity, 
7 might be very short of breath, he might be short of 
8 air. 
9 A To answer your question, yes. That 
10 undoubtedly would make it difficult to breathe with 
11 two gunshots affecting your right chest, 
12 undoubtedly. 
13 You said that 
14 entrance wound and it affected the lung and the rib 
15 was broken? 
16 A Correct. 
17 And it also affected the 
18 clavicle? 
19 A Correct. 
20 So when someone's hurt, I 
21 know when I'm hurt for whatever reason, my instinct 
22 
23 
is to do this? (indicating) 
A Correct. 
24 My instinct when I'm in 
25 pain would not be to do this, not arms up, but that

1 could be misleading. If we were hurt like that, our 
2 instinct would be to bend over? 
3 A I agree, that's possible. 
4 Okay. And he would be 
5 out of breath, so he'd be breathing heavy probably. 
6 A Yes, he would have labored breathing. It 
7 would be difficult to get a good breath at this 
8 point. 
9 With that 
10 same out of breath, he's out of breath, maybe he 
11 can't move as fast? 
12 A Oh, I agree, undoubtedly. These are 
13 definitely, they're not fatal gunshot wounds, but 
14 they are difficult to breathe afterwards. I mean, 
15 having any injury to your right chest like that. 
16 Once a bullet goes through your lung, a lot of 
17 things can start happening physiologically. Your 
18 lungs can shrink down, it can be a real difficult 
19 time to breathe after that. 
20 You could still run or 
21 walk? 
22 A You have a lot of reserves, especially in 
23 a certain situation like this and you have a lot of 
24 adrenaline going, you will be surprised what you can 
25 do after you receive a gunshot wound.

18 I have one question, 
19 On that forehead shot, I know we talked 
20 about some of the lungs, would he be able to still 
21 stay on his feet and run?

5 We've seen people knocked out from

7 forehead. Yes, I believe it could be very difficult 
8 to not be disoriented after receiving that.

23 firearm. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: And just let me ask you 
25 this. This is an entrance wound, correct?

A Correct. 1 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Was there a corresponding 
3 exit wound for this injury? 
4 A There was not. On the x-rays we noticed a 
5 projectile on kind of the right side of his head. 
6 So this particular trajectory through the head went 
7 downward and to the right. It went right through 
8 the right hemisphere of the brain, clear through it. 
9 Clear through the parietal lobe, clear through the 
10 temporal lobe and then they recovered a bullet next 
11 to the base of the skull beneath the brain, and that 
12 was also fractured. 
13 So there were skull fractures at the 
14 top of the head and also at the base of the skull 
15 and quite a bit of what we call intracranial 
16 bleeding. There was a lot of blood associated with 
17 this bullet going through the head. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you explain what the 
19 effects of this wound would have been on Michael 
20 Brown? 
21 A Right. So, you know, we had some debate 
22 with the gunshot wound to the forehead if that could 
23 immediately debilitate you and make it impossible to 
24 have purposeful movement. This gunshot wound, in my 
25 opinion, would be instantly fatal.

1 You know, there are things that we 
2 hear about in the media and the literature, people 
3 getting gunshot wounds through the head and still 
4 being able to do purposeful things. This one in 
5 particular went right through the right hemisphere 
6 of the brain. And then through really important 
7 areas. Motor control of the left side of your body 
8 would have been right there where the bullet went 
9 through. I don't think he could do any purposeful 
10 movement after this. He would have been instantly 
11 unconscious in my opinion. 
12 Q When he received that injury, would his 
13 body become limp? 
14 A In my opinion, yes. I think he would fall 
15 rapidly once receiving this gunshot wound. 
16 He would fall 
17 forward? He would not be able to go to his knees? 
18 A Okay. So that's going to depend on where 
19 your center of gravity is when you receive this 
20 gunshot wound. Again, gunshot wounds in three 
21 dimensional space, they're difficult. I mean, 
22 there's a possibility he could have been leaning 
23 back at this point. It is difficult to say. 
24 If he was leaning forward when he 
25 received this, I think it is still possible he could

1 have hit his knees on the way down. 
2 If he had hit his knees, 
3 is it possible to be no abrasion on his knees? 
4 A Well, I took a look at his clothing, which 
5 we didn't have and obviously he wasn't clothed when 
6 he came in for his third autopsy, but his shorts do 
7 seem to go beyond his knees, around the level of the 
8 mid calf. I think they would have offered some 
9 protection to his knees, so it is possible he could 
10 have hit his knees on the pavement and not gotten an 
11 abrasion. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, hold on. Is this the 
13 last gunshot wound. 
14 A Well, we haven't talked in full detail 
15 about the one to thumb yet.

17 already seen, correct?

A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So to spare everybody from 
20 looking. If you want to see those other images that 
21 show the eye and the mouth, let me ask you this, you 
22 talked about the injury to his right eye. Did you 
23 notice anything remarkable about his mouth? 
24 A Uh, no. So when we open the mouth, we are 
25 going to look at the teeth and make sure they're all

1 intact. We also look at the frenulae, that's 
2 basically the part that attaches the gum to your 
3 lip, that was all intact. I didn't notice any 
4 significant injury to the mouth. 
5 The tongue was still in place, we 
6 took the tongue out and we didn't see in any 
7 injuries to the tongue either. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. Did you examine 
9 the neck of Michael Brown? 
10 A So with any autopsy we first look at the 
11 exterior of the neck, we didn't see any lesions at 
12 all on the surface of his neck, any lesions on the 
13 back of his neck. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: What's a lesion, Doctor? 
15 A Any kind of a defect out of the ordinary 
16 that you wouldn't expect to see. So we didn't see 
17 any abrasions, any contusions, any lacerations, no 
18 injuries. 
19 During the autopsy you reflect the 
20 skin over the face and then we can look at 
21 underneath, we can look at all of the musculature of 
22 the neck, we can look at the deep layers of the 
23 skin. We didn't see any evidence that there was any 
24 bleeding in any of the neck structures.

1 through your autopsy or examining the photographs 
2 and the report from Dr. autopsy, did you 
3 note that there was any bruising to the neck area? 
4 A No, we did not, nor through our 
5 examination or review of what Dr. had done, 
6 there was no injury to any of the neck structures. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: We talked yesterday a 
8 little bit about this bruising is a very difficult 
9 thing to interpret, would that be fair to say? 
A Correct. 10 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And people bruise 
12 differently? 
13 A Correct. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And people have different 
15 skin tones, might make it more difficult to see a 
16 bruise, visualize a bruise, correct? 
17 A Correct. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you see a bruise after 
19 you've reflected the skin? 
20 A Yes, especially once we reflect the skin, 
21 you can actually see, a real bruise is going to 
22 diffuse in the skin beneath. 
23 So you can take your scalpel blade 
24 and run it over a bruise. If there is contusion or 
25 bleeding underneath that's consistent with a true

1 bruise. But in this situation, we didn't see 
2 anything like that in the neck. 
3 Just so I understand what 
4 you're saying, I know I want to make sure that I 
5 understand it. 
6 It is easier to see a bruise under the 
7 skin than it is on the skin? 
8 A Oh, no, not necessarily. It depends on 
9 the skin tone, it depends, you know, how old you 
10 are, because it is pretty easy to see bruising on 
11 some people that are over the age of whatever. Very 
12 old people have thinner skin. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Be careful, Doctor. 
14 A That is true. 
15 Just because they 
16 couldn't see it doesn't mean the bruising wasn't 
17 there? 
18 
19 
A There was no evidence of bruising. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Again, visually on the 
20 surface, no evidence of bruising, correct?

3 somewhat, but have you seen strangulation injuries?

15 someone were to have grabbed Michael Brown around 
16 his throat with one hand and were to have hold 
17 tightly enough with that grasp so that Michael Brown 
18 could not get away from that grasp, would you expect 
19 to see bruising? 
20 A I would, I would. Strangulation in 
21 general is a very violent act and it requires a lot 
22 of force. And in order to do it effectively, you 
23 need to be doing it hard. So you are going to have

3 A I would prefer to use Dr. 
4 photography on this. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I've got some

10 I'm going to show you one that is Image

12 is when I put it up on the overhead here. So if you 
13 need to look at it on the overhead, I can have that, 
14 I can show you the picture, but can you see it 
15 clearly enough to describe what you need to see to

1 wound. 
Q Why do you think that? 2 
3 A So this is very classic once again for a 
4 tangential gunshot wound. It was going in this 
5 direction towards the base of the palm here and the 
6 reason why I can say that is because whenever these 
7 injuries occur, these skin tags will form and they 
8 point toward the direction from which the bullet 
9 came. 
10 So you can appreciate them a lot 
11 better here than you can on our autopsy photograph. 
12 And again, the body has been embalmed, the tissue's 
13 kind of contract and it makes it difficult, but you 
14 can appreciate several tags that point in that 
15 transaction. 
16 Trajectory is going this way, and in 
17 this area, and I know it is difficult to appreciate 
18 projected on the screen, but I'm sure you guys have 
19 seen these photos in person before. 
20 Again, I would suggest you take a 
21 close look at this area. This was from the first 
22 autopsy, it is after he washed the hand, but before 
23 he took sections of it for special microscopies. He 
24 was interested in this area right here which is the 
25 origination of this gunshot wound where the bullet

1 came from. 
2 So right in this region, the skin is 
3 slightly discolored, it's a little gray in 
4 comparison to the skin around it. It's hard to see 
5 on the screen, but on these images you can see it up 
6 close. That is our interpretation of soot. It is 
7 from the barrel of the gun. 
8 And we can confirm that when we take 
9 this and we look at it under the microscope and we 
10 can see the soot deposits on the skin and within the 
gunshot wound track. (indicating) 11 
12 Q Now, at some point after your autopsy, did 
13 you receive some slides and some photographs of 
14 slides that were sent to you by ? 
15 A Yes, ma'am, I did. took 
16 photographs of a slide from this location and sent 
17 it to me and then eventually sent me a slide to look 
18 at under my own microscope. 
19 Q And we've seen actually a picture of the 
20 slide that you have talked about. Actually, the 
21 slide we had shown during Dr. testimony I 
22 received from the Department of Defense, but the 
23 image that you looked at through the microscope, did 
24 you draw any conclusions about whether or not there 
25 were any foreign particulate in the tissue?

1 A Yes. So what we're actually seeing, if 
2 you guys have already seen this image, it might be 
3 easier to explain. Little black deposits, foreign 
4 material. It is highly consistent with soot. 
5 And again, we see the same thing in 
6 people that are in and around fires that get smoke 
7 inhalation. Inside the airways when we look at it 
8 under the microscope, we can see soot deposits, this

I don't know what else it is, it's 
Could it be dirt? 
It is not my opinion that it is dirt. 
What does it tell you then if you looked 
15 at the tissue samples provided to you by 
16 Dr. as well as the pictures of the slides 
17 that he has taken. What is your conclusion once you 
18 determine that he believed that there is soot 
19 deposited in the tissue that you examined? 
20 A That this is officially close range 
21 discharge of a firearm at this point. This entrance 
22 wound was extremely close to the barrel of the 
23 weapon. 
24 Q And what would be the farthest distance 
25 that you would consider before you would say it was

1 not close range? 
2 A So we discussed this briefly before, 
3 again, in order to get soot deposition, standard 
4 ballpark number, standard handgun about one foot 
5 out. After two feet, you no longer see soot 
6 certainly, and you don't see any gunpowder 
7 stippling. Beyond 2 feet you won't see any evidence 
8 of close range discharge. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Did you see any gunpowder stippling? 
We did not see any gunpowder stippling on 
11 any of the gunshot wounds in this case. 
12 Q It is your opinion that the foreign 
13 particulates, the little black specs that you saw on 
14 the slide that was the tissue sample from the wound 
15 of the right hand, that that was soot and that would 
16 indicate to you that it was a close range wound? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q Did you do any gunshot residue test on 
19 that wound? 
20 A We do not. The Arm Forces Medical 
21 Examiner System does not do gunshot residue testing. 
22 It is usually through CID or NCIS, one of the other 
23 investigative agencies. We did not do that in this 
24 case.

1 most part useless. The body had been autopsied 
2 twice before, it has been washed a number of times, 
3 embalmed, it wouldn't have given anything valuable 
4 at that point. 
5 I was writing 
6 while you're talking. Are you saying in order to 
7 get soot they would have to be one foot or closer? 
8 A Within a foot, ballpark within a foot. 
9 With gunshot wounds, if it is right up against the 
10 skin, at that point all the soot is going to be 
11 inside the wound. It's not going to deposit around 
12 the skin because the muzzle is pressed against the 
13 skin. 
14 As you start to pull back, the other 
15 thing you will see when it is right up against is a 
16 muzzle imprint. You can actually see the barrel 
17 basically abraded and stamped right on the skin 
18 around it. 
19 So you will soot and you also get 
20 searing of the skin, like a thermal burning affect 
21 from the hot gases of the gun going onto the skin. 
22 As you start to move the weapon back, 
23 the soot will start to disburse around the entrance 
24 wound a little bit and then as you move further and 
25 further back, you will start to get stippling. And

1 what stippling is, is basically the gunpowder 
2 particles, both burning and unburning that come out 
3 of the barrel, they pepper the skin, it's abrasions. 
4 They are not burns, they're abrasions from the 
5 gunpowder hitting the skin. 
6 You usually have to be a few inches 
7 back before you start to get stippling. Soot 
8 indicates to me it is close, we're within a few 
9 inches here, this is close. 
10 So if it were up close 
11 right to the skin, it would be almost like a 
12 branding. 
13 A Right, you would see a muzzle imprint. In 
14 this case we don't, but remember, though, this is a 
15 tangential gunshot wound, the gun is not 
16 perpendicular to the skin at this point. So the 
17 muzzle, you know, if I'm trying to recreate this as 
18 it is in my left hand. The muzzle is going to be 
19 like this compared to the skin, it is going to be 
20 close, it is not right on it. We would probably see 
21 some kind of a muzzle imprint at that point. 
22 Is that the 
23 direction that the stippling shows the gun was 
24 fired?

1 direction. Starts here and goes in that way and 
2 that's why the soot is deposited here because that's 
3 the closest to the barrel in this location. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Dr. , you 
5 made a further finding in your examination of the 
6 slide or slides, you received several images and 
7 slides; is that right? 
8 A Correct, yeah. Dr. has sent me 
9 at least three or four images of his slide. 
10 Q We actually just used one today. For our 
11 purposes, it kind of all looks the same to me, if 
12 you feel it would help you to explain, we've got 
13 images of all of your slides. If I put up the slide 
14 that you and I looked at yesterday, would it help

1 Dr. , you and I met yesterday and we talked 
2 about this image and can you describe for the grand 
3 jurors what you are seeing? 
4 A Okay. So we don't really have an 
5 establishing low power shot to kind of explain where 
6 we are. I can tell you this is the dermal part of 
7 the skin, it is the deeper layers of skin. 
8 So you have the surface which is the 
9 epidermis and under that is the dermis. It's a 
10 little deeper, but it's not quite into the fat, 
11 which is pretty deep into the skin. 
12 So what we are seeing here along this 
13 side, this is the gunshot wound track that was from 
14 that gunshot wound into the thumb, okay. And what 
15 we are seeing along the edge here are these 
16 polarizable fragments here, and then this black 
17 carbonation looking deposit. 
18 This is soot, in my opinion. There's 
19 really nothing else on my differential. Dirt, I 
20 don't see how dirt is going to get into that wound 
21 in this situation and not really be deposited 
22 somewhere else on the palm that we're going to be 
23 able to see it. 
24 Furthermore, when tissue is processed 
25 in histology, it is a pretty destructive process and

1 there's a lot of washing, a lot of chemicals. I 
2 would think that simple dirt would get washed away, 
3 okay. 
4 And also look at where this stuff is. 
5 It is actually getting inside the tissue a little 
6 bit. For dirt to just crawl inside of the tissue, I 
7 think it would be difficult to do. I think this was 
8 deposited by force with a gunshot. 
9 Q So this jagged edge along the right side 
10 of the tissue, that's the track of the bullet or it 
11 shows the track of the injury at least? 
12 A Yeah. So in order for me to explain 
13 exactly where this is, I have to go back again to 
14 the photograph of the hand. But this is the bullet 
15 would have gone right through this location and it 
16 would have literally touched and injured this skin. 
17 Q Okay. And so you mentioned the polarized 
18 particles, are those little white things? 
19 A Yeah, these things that are standing out 
20 as clear like that and these guys, those are called 
21 polarizable foreign debris is what that is. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
And the black things are? 
Again, we would just call this soot. I 
24 cannot tell you exactly what that is. It's 
25 polarizable foreign debris.

1 So if you think about when you shoot 
2 a gun, a lot of things come out of that barrel than 
3 just a bullet. You have vaporized pieces of metal, 
4 all sorts of things coming out. So it could be 
5 that, I'm not sure. 
6 Q Okay. Now, you also made a particular 
7 finding about some thermal changes to the tissue? 
8 A Correct. So thermal changes to the tissue 
9 again, it just means it is in close proximity to 
10 that barrel, so the heat from the gun can actually 
11 thermally coagulate the skin. A lot of what we see 
12 in those situations, these are nuclei down here, the 
13 nucleus is inside the cell. They can start to blur 
14 and stream, it is kind of hard to see these as clear 
15 as you would if it hadn't been heated up. 
16 Again, here, there is some indication 
17 that there were nuclei here, but they're all kind of 
18 homogenizing and blurring and blending. It is a 
19 soft indicator there was probably some thermal 
20 affect here. 
21 Q And so when a bullet passes through the 
22 barrel of a gun, does the barrel itself heat up? 
23 A The barrel itself would, there is a lot of 
24 pressure in that barrel, it would heat up. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And then the gases that are expelled?

1 A Especially hot, the gases that come out of 
2 the barrel, you get a muzzle flame and super heated 
3 gases that come out of the barrel and they can burn 
4 you. 
5 Q When you examine the injury visually on 
6 the hand, do you see any evidence of burning? 
7 A So we have to remember when I did my 
8 autopsy, Dr. had already taken this 
9 relevant area out of the body. He submitted it for 
10 histology, so I had nothing to look at really of the 
11 hand that would suggest to me at that moment in time 
12 that there was close range. 
13 Q So your conclusion about the thermal 
14 changes is based strictly on your examination of the 
15 slides that were provided? 
16 A And Dr. photographs. 
17 Q Okay. And so is there a difference, can 
18 you draw, what conclusion do you draw from the fact 
19 that you see thermal changes in the tissue? 
20 A I would just lump it altogether and say 
21 close range discharge of a firearm. It is within a 
22 very close proximity of the muzzle of the weapon, 
23 enough to get thermal effect as well as soot 
24 deposition. 
25 Q

Is there any difference, it has to be

1 closer, or farther away, like you could possibly 
2 wouldn't see? 
3 A I know what you are trying to say. 
4 Q You give a range for the close contact or 
5 the close range? 
6 A That would cause thermal effect? 
7 Q Yes. 
8 A That is difficult, I cannot do that. I 
9 don't know of any ballpark numbers to say, you know, 
10 it has to be 2 inches before you see thermal affect. 
11 I don't know, but I can tell you it has to be close. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And then you 
13 prepared a report regarding your findings in this 
14 case. I'm going to hand you what I've marked as 
15 State's Exhibit: Number 80. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask a question while 
17 you are looking for that. Doctor, can you say that 
18 how the injury occurred to the hand, I mean, you 
19 could say close range, but you can't say whether or 
20 not someone was grabbing the weapon and moving it or 
21 trying to avoid the weapon from shooting them or any 
22 of that? 
23 A Right, there's nothing based on images and 
24 histology for me to be able to say how the hand was 
25 and what he was intending to do, I have no idea.

1 MS. WHIRLEY: You're not calling it a 
2 contact? 
3 A I'm calling it close range. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Close range. Tell us the 
5 difference, I know it sounds self-explanatory. 
6 A It is kind of what we are discussing. In 
7 order for me to call it literally contact gunshot 
8 wound, the muzzle was on the skin. I would prefer 
9 to see a lot of soot deposition inside the wound. I 
10 like to see some searing of the barrel. I would 
11 like to see a muzzle imprint of the barrel on the 
12 skin. That's what I prefer to see in order to say 
13 contact range. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: You don't see any of that, 
15 so you call it close range? 
16 A Close range. It's a little bit more of a 
17 hedgy term. To say I don't know exactly how far it 
18 was, but it wasn't necessarily right up against the 
19 skin. 
20 A contact 
21 would be somebody taking their life? 
22 A If they take the barrel and put it right 
23 to their temple and pull the trigger, yes, I would 
24 call that a contact range gunshot wound.

5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going ahead to mark 
6 my copy, and this is Grand Jury Exhibit 81, is this 
7 a copy of your autopsy report? 
8 A Yes, ma'am. This is copy of our autopsy 
9 report. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. Since this is my 
11 copy and I've marked it with highlights, but I'm 
12 going to make a clean copy for everyone. I thought 
13 I already did this, but just for the sake of making

23 any differences between your findings and

25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
?

1 difference is that wound that we described on the 
2 left forearm. He called it blunt force, I called it 
3 sharp force. Whether that's significant, but that's 
4 the only difference. 
5 Q In order for you to perform your autopsy, 
6 did you need to see the vehicle, Michael Brown's 
7 vehicle, I mean, Officer Wilson's vehicle? 
8 A No, ma'am. 
9 Q What about medical records from Officer 
10 Wilson? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
Did you need to see the clothing from 
13 Officer Wilson? 
14 A No. 
15 Q And you said you did not have the clothing 
16 for Michael Brown when you did your autopsy, 
17 correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Would it have been helpful for you to have 
20 the clothing? 
21 A It is always helpful to have the clothing 
22 in gunshot wound cases. That way you can see any 
23 soot or anything, any gunpowder particles on the 
24 clothing, but it doesn't mean I can't perform my job 
25 if I don't have them.

1 Q Was there anything that you needed in 
2 order to do your job and come up with your findings 
3 that you didn't have? 
4 A No. 
5 Q Did you, how did you have the gun to 
6 examine? 
7 A Oh, no. 
8 Q Did you need to have the gun in order to 
9 come up with your findings? 
10 A No, ma'am, I have never had a gun to look 
11 at during an autopsy. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Anything else. 
13 Was this 
14 the time that you examined the body eight days 
15 later. Do you normally examine, is there like an 
16 earliness or being eight days late, do you normally 
17 examine later or sooner? 
18 A So my job is kind of unique. People that 
19 die overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq, it takes them 
20 a number of days to get back to Dover. Sometimes 
21 embarrassing, they it could take a week. So I'm 
22 pretty accustom to seeing bodies if they have been 
23 dead for a number of days.

2 or prepare your report? 
3 A No, ma'am. Yesterday was the first day I 
4 was seeing the crime scene photos. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: That was when you and I 
6 were talking about this? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And would you have 
9 needed those to have performed the autopsy and come 
10 up with your findings? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Not in this case, no. 
The ones I showed you, you recall that we 
13 were looking at the position of the deceased body as 
14 it laid on the ground and the position of his right 
15 hand? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q All right. And was I asking you if you 
18 would expect to see dirt in the wound when his hand 
19 would be positioned in that manner? 
20 A All we can see from that is that the 
21 relevant gunshot surface of his hand was not 
22 touching the ground, that's all I can say about 
23 that.

4 12 grand jurors are present and , the court 
5 reporter, is present and taking down what's 
6 happening in the grand jury. We have one more 
7 witness for today and his name is 
I'm not sure if it is And I 8 
9 believe it is he will spell it 
10 when he gets here. 
11 And so prior to his testimony, we're going 
12 to play a disc that I've marked.

15 MS. ALIZADEH: Grand Jury Exhibit Number

17 of a POD cast. Do you all know what a POD cast is? 
18 If you were on the internet, you can broadcast 
19 yourself as well as images and voice, okay. 
20 There is a man, I don't know where he 
21 originates from, but his name I'm 
22 not sure how you say it. But he has a POD cast and 
23 so you will see from the video, you can see him and

1 microphone, but he talks about all kind of things. 
2 This is a regular thing for him, this is 
3 what he does. And then he also take his calls, 
4 people call in like a radio show, they will talk 
5 about whatever the topic is. 
6 And then those programs get broadcast out 
7 on the internet. Go to whatever his website is to 
8 watch his show and so this is a recording of a part 
9 of his show, where the caller talks about having 
10 witnessed the shooting of Michael Brown. 
11 And so we're going to go ahead and play 
12 the call first. This is again Grand Jury Exhibit 
13 Number 82. Actually on this disc there are two 
14 files. And I'm playing the file that is entitled To 
15 Police Brutality! What Should Citizens Do. 
16 The other file is actually the beginning 
17 of the show before the caller calls in and it is 
18 just the host of the show talking about things, so 
19 it is not something that eyewitness account. 
20 Let me pause it because, , we do not 
21 have a transcript. As best you can if you could

16 measure my next comments. The first thing I said, I 
17 own up to it, first thing I said was the cops need 
18 to start feeling what the citizens are feeling. And 
19 I still feel that way because cops have literally 
20 gone too far how they are handling their citizens, 
21 but I also looked at the scene. I looked at how 
22 many hair hats was out there, (inaudible) we talk 
23 about that, doesn't it bother you a little bit that 
24 it was way more women, looks like 70 to 80 percent 
25 women.

15 his car, and his left side would be toward you then,

15 Q And why did you say that on the show?

A Yes. 
Q So when the officer starts running after

1 Q And so at some point is Mike Brown running 
2 east on Canfield, you lose sight of him and then you 
3 don't actually see the shooting? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q Now, and again, on the show which was a 
6 couple of days after this you said that you saw him 
7 shooting at Mike Brown as he ran and that you saw 
8 Mike Brown stop and turn around and then come back 
9 toward the officer?

Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Today you are saying you didn't see that? 
Right, I assumed that he did. 
So when you said that on the show, that 
14 was just your assumption? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Why did you assume that, do you still 
17 assume that today? 
18 A Because when Mike Brown is running he's 
19 running down the street and when I seen the body out 
20 there, he was turned the other direction towards the 
21 cop, towards the officer. So I assume that he was 
22 probably running towards him.

1 Q So you are basing that assumption just on 
2 the way the body was positioned in the street? 
3 A Yes, when he was laying down. 
4 Q And is he on his stomach or on his back or 
5 side? 
6 A He was on his stomach, I believe. 
7 Q So could you see how he was laying in the 
8 street from where you were, did you have to come up 
9 and go out onto the street? 
10 A I came up and came out to the sidewalk and 
11 saw the body out there. 
12 Q Did you, the entire incident that you 
13 witnessed, did you witness it from inside your 
14 apartment? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes, the incident, yes, I did. 
And do you recall telling on the

18 one point when gunfire happened, you kind of ducked 
19 because you didn't want to get shot?

1 street or were you mad you thought Mike Brown did 
2 something or either one of those? 
3 A Basically because, you know, the situation 
4 that was outside my apartment, folks gathering 
5 around. Like I said, drinking and smoking, you 
6 know, it was like a carnival out there. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: I see, okay. 
8 With 
9 everything that was going on at that time up there, 
10 and the proximity of the police officers in the 
11 area, did you not think to maybe call the police and 
12 tell them to get the people away from your door or 
13 what? 
14 A The police was out there. 
15 I understand that, I 
16 understand that, but just help me understand you 
17 said you were upset because people were out around 
18 your apartment and they were drinking and smoking, 
19 and whatever? 
20 A Yes. 
21 Wouldn't it have been 
22 easier to, I'm just asking this for me to call 911, 
23 send some police up here, these people around my 
24 place, yada, yada, yada.

You don't think so? 
No. 
Okay. That's fair enough. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? 
5 I know you 
6 said earlier they were outside your door drinking 
7 and smoking, it was like a carnival you said. Was 
8 it were they angry or was it a little bit 
9 celebratory, can you tell me the atmosphere of the 
10 people? Were you upset because you felt like it 
11 wasn't taken seriously, how do you explain your 
12 mindset? 
13 A Well, to be honest with you, I think it 
14 was ridiculous. There's a right and wrong to do 
15 things, I feel they was going about it the wrong 
16 way, you know. It was just ridiculous. All of this 
17 stuff could have been avoided. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else have a 
19 question?
