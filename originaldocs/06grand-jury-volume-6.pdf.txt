1 GRAND JURY HEARING 
2 On Officer Darren 
3 Wilson's testimony he mentioned in the physical 
4 layout that Mr. Brown ran almost to a light pole 
5 before he turned around. Do we have a diagram with 
6 that light pole on it? 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I will have to look and see 
8 if it is included in the diagram. I'm sure there 
9 are pictures and videos that you will see, be able 
10 to see the light pole in those images and then if 
11 necessary, when we have a witness who is familiar 
12 with the scene, if need be, we could have them using 
13 our diagram, which has already been in evidence 
14 point out to you where the light pole exactly is. 
15 All right, very good.

MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(All jurors say good morning.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: This is Kathi Alizadeh with 
19 the prosecutor's office, present is Sheila Whirley 
20 with the prosecutor's office, all 12 grand jurors 
21 are present today, it is September 23rd, as well as 
22 the court reporter or the stenographer who is taking 
23 down what is being said. We are also recording, 
24 audio recording, that's happening in the grand jury 
25 right now.

1 I wanted to make some preliminary remarks. 
2 Now is the, in the next couple of days and a few 
3 weeks, I suppose, we are going to be hearing 
4 testimony from some people say that they are 
5 eyewitnesses of parts of this incident. And many of 
6 them have already had, been interviewed, all of them 
7 have been interviewed by law enforcement at some 
8 point. And as far as I can think of, almost all of 
9 them have been recorded by law enforcement as far as 
10 their interviews. 
11 As you know, we are recording, audio 
12 recording everything that's being said as well as 
13 taking down by court stenographer everything that is 
14 being said. 
15 That is an extraordinary thing that in my 
16 experience, we've never done before. And, you know, 
17 the proceedings in the grand jury are historically, 
18 have been secret and people who appear before the 
19 grand jury are testifying in secret and it is 
20 usually not disclosed that they testified or what 
21 they said. But in the interest of the public's need 
22 to know that this investigation is thorough and 
23 fair, my boss, Robert McCulloch, has decided to do 
24 this extraordinary thing, which is to record 
25 everything. And if there is sometime down the road

1 if there is ever an issue as to whether or not this 
2 investigation was thorough and fair, we will have 
3 those recordings to show exactly what was done. 
4 But as you can imagine, there are 
5 witnesses who are very uncomfortable who have 
6 information and are willing to come forward, but do 
7 not want their names disclosed on the record or 
8 where they live or, you know, their birthdate, any 
9 identifying information about them and that's 
10 understandable given what, you know, has happened in 
11 our community in the past month about, you know, the 
12 public's reaction to the incident and the 
13 investigation into this. 
14 And so because our goal is to get as much 
15 information as possible so that you can decide the 
16 facts in this case, we have decided that witnesses 
17 who do not want their name or identifying 
18 information about them to be on the record, we are 
19 not going to put that on the record. 
20 What we are going to do is when that 
21 witness comes forward, he will be sworn, he or she 
22 will be sworn, and then the court reporter will not 
23 activate the audio recording initially. That 
24 witness will then identify themselves to you by 
25 their name and where they live, although I told them

1 I'm not going to ask them for an address, mainly 
2 just south county, you know, I live in the Ferguson 
3 area, I live in north county, or what have you. 
4 And then those witnesses will be referred 
5 to, once they've given that identifying information, 
6 then I will have the court reporter start the audio 
7 recording at that point. So their testimony will 
8 still be recorded and the court reporter will 
9 transcribe their testimony, but they will be 
10 referred to by myself and in the court reporters 
11 record by witness number. 
12 Last night I made a list of every witness 
13 who has appeared before you so far and just for the 
14 sake of the record, we're just going to go 
15 chronologically with the live witnesses as they've 
16 testified. 
17 So if you recall who was the 
18 investigator with the Medical Examiner's Office, he 
19 was witness number one. Number two was Detective 
20 Number three was , although 
21 will have to come back because we had to cut 
22 him his testimony short, if you recall. 
23 
24 
25 
Number four was Dr. , the medical 
examiner. Number five, Number six 
was Sergeant with the Ferguson Police

1 Department. Number seven, Detective 
2 with the County Police Department. Number eight was 
3 Special Agent with the FBI and finally 
4 number nine, last week, was Darren Wilson, the 
5 Ferguson police officer. 
6 So we will continue to call witnesses and 
7 give them a number so that if they do not want to be 
8 identified on the record we will refer to them as 
9 witness number 12, 15, you know, what have you. 
10 Urn, we are not going to do that for 
11 witnesses who have been on the media because those 
12 people have chosen to put themselves out there in 
13 the public eye, they've identified themselves by 
14 name, they're on TV, so those witnesses will, their 
15 names will be on the record. I'll ask them their 
16 name and, you know, where they live and in the 
17 general vicinity where they live. 
18 The other issue is that because we are 
19 going to be playing recorded statements that these 
20 people have made, and many, in fact, most of these 
21 recorded statements, the statements begin with the 
22 witness giving their name, their date of birth, 
23 their social security number, their address and 
24 sometimes, you know their cell phone numbers. 
25 And, again, I believe that probably in the

1 case of every witness, that information probably 
2 should not be made public. I think it is okay for 
3 the witnesses who have been on the news for their 
4 names to be out there, but probably not their social 
5 security numbers and their exact address and cell 
6 phone numbers. 
7 So for that reason, when we begin playing 
8 a recording of a witness' statement, I will have the 
9 court reporter turn off the audio recorder in here. 
10 The statements are, they're already on disc, they 
11 are marked as exhibits, so we have those statements. 
12 I will make a record that I'm playing 
13 Grand Jury Exhibit, you know, so and so. I'm 
14 playing the statement of Witness Number 12, who off 
15 the record was identified by us as, you know, by 
16 name and so then we will stop the audio recording to 
17 play the audio interview that is on disc. 
18 In most of these cases we also have 
19 transcripts of the recordings that we will pass out 
20 to you and then the court reporter will also have a 
21 transcript so he can, that will assist him in taking 
22 down what's being said, but he will also be 
23 instructed, you are instructed that at some point 
24 we're going to have to redact that information from 
25 the transcript. You and I can discuss that later,

1 but you know, the whole purpose of this is so that 
2 we can, you know, keep people, people's private 
3 information private. And in the case of people who 
4 don't want to be identified for fear of 
5 reattribution, we need to keep them, I guess, 
6 unidentified, at least on the record. 
7 Does anybody have any questions about that 
8 process is or how we are going to do that? We're 
9 going to kind of have to work out kinks as we go 
10 because I had a discussion at length with other 
11 people in my office last night about how we were 
12 going to go about doing this. So we're going to see 
13 how it goes, I guess. 
14 So, for 
15 instance, these witnesses who are being identified 
16 for us at least, does that mean if this were to go 
17 to trial that they would not appear, only this 
18 portion would then be presented in a trial or they 
19 may potentially be required to present themselves? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: If this matter were to go 
21 to trial, I mean, first of all, it is not something 
22 that you should all really worry about too much. 
23 Your job is not, I don't want you guys thinking 
24 about what is going to happen after you all make 
25 your decision. You can't be affected by that.

1 But in the constitution, everybody who is 
2 in trial has the right to confront and cross-examine 
3 witnesses who give testimony against them. So, you 
4 know, the constitution will not allow us to put on, 
5 you know, unidentified witnesses. 
6 I know you probably have all seen on 
7 television when there are proceedings televised, 
8 they will black out the witness' face, but that is 
9 just for television. 
10 In a courtroom setting, that witness' face 
11 is not blurred, obviously. So you will understand 
12 that that's not something that you have to, I mean, 
13 that's not a part of your decision process. 
14 Whatever happens after this, we will deal 
15 with it, whatever happens, but for now, this is how 
16 we are going to proceed. 
17 So when 
18 we get to the end of everything, all the 
19 proceedings, these audios that we are doing, they 
20 will be made public? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: That is a decision that we 
22 have to wait and see. My boss, Mr. McCulloch, has 
23 made a public statement about his intentions. 
24 Obviously, if this case, you know, that I can't say 
25 for sure. I know he has made public statements at

1 some point this all will be released. But when, I 
2 cannot say and again, that's one of the reasons why 
3 you all are referring to yourselves by juror number. 
4 Your identities will never be disclosed. So that's 
5 how we are trying to handle this. 
6 Does anybody else have any other questions 
7 about the process? 
8 And, I hate to ask you, you 
9 normally don't ask questions. You understand what I 
10 was trying to explain about the process? 
11 I will give you one later when you are 
12 actually doing your transcript. 
13 Any other questions? 
14 So our first witness of the day is not 
15 here yet, but we are going to go ahead and start 
16 playing discs that we have that are statements that 
17 he has made previously. But what you are going to 
18 hear, and I hope he's just running late, but the 
19 first witness of the day, our plans were to call 
20 , and he is not here. 
21 So we're going to keep going. The first 
22 disc that you are going to hear is labeled as Grand 
23 Jury Exhibit 22.

1 young guy was at the Ferguson police car on the 
2 passenger window. And I see something exchanged, 
3 some arms exchanged and that's when I call my 
4 fiancee for her to look out the window and, urn, 
5 that's when I ran into the front outside, and that 
6 when, urn, I see, actually, it was two guys. 
7 Urn, when, but the guy, he constantly, he 
8 just ran down in the middle of the street and the 
9 officer just gets out the car and shoots. 
10 I thought it was six times. So, urn, when 
11 he, when he hit, I guess when he hit the first and 
12 the second time, the guy, he kinda stopped and 
13 turned around facing the officer, uh, bent down a 
14 little bit curled up, and the officer let out, what, 
15 three, maybe four more shots to the guy and that's 
16 when he hit the ground and, urn, and that was it and 
17 that was the whole thing. 
18 And he actually had a friend, he, I don't 
19 know, I just seen him duck down, a car, urn, they had 
20 a car door open, it was a white car, urn, he hopped 
21 in, I guess those two cars left.

3 other guy who was by the officer's car, can you

7 that he was black, urn, he had dreads.

17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So I know I talked 
18 about not recording the audio statement because he 
19 did state his date of birth and address, we will 
20 have to deal with that and see if that can be 
21 somehow redacted. For this next statement he makes, 
22 I'm going to go ahead and let that be recorded 
23 because he doesn't make any other statements as to, 
24 you know, personal information. So I will, we'll go

2 door. 
3 I wakes up, which is now 11:00. He comes 
4 and, urn, I goes outside for a few minutes with him 
5 outside or whatever. And he, we went outside for 
6 not long, two, three, four or five minutes. So I 
7 happen to go back in, he leaves. 
8 It is getting what, about 11:45 now, urn, I 
9 was about to take a nap, and I hear an altercation 
10 outside. 
11 So I looks outside and, urn, I see like 
12 some kind of tussling going on in the window. 
13 Really not sure if, urn, if Mike Brown was punching 
14 on him or if the officer was grabbing on him, but 
15 something was going on through the window, it just 
16 didn't look right. So I glued my eyes to it. 
17 And all of the sudden, urn, I see, I also 
18 see his friend, his friend. Urn, he was, he was on 
19 the side of the car, he was on the front bumper on 
20 the passenger side, maybe 4, 5 feet away from him. 
21 And all of the sudden, like I said, they just takes 
22 off running. 
23 And when they takes off running, I see his 
24 friend, he runs behind a two door white car. He's 
25 ducking down behind the trunk of the car looking at

1 the officer because he just immediately gets out of 
2 his vehicle and just started shooting at Mike Brown. 
3 Because he runs down, straight down the middle of 
4 the road. 
5 And, urn, when his friend ran behind the 
6 trunk of the car, he was looking at the officer 
7 thinking that the officer might cut off and walk to 
8 him and shoot him, but obviously, he is just taking 
9 like, you know, large steps in a shooting position, 
10 shooting directly at Mike Brown, and he walked past 
11 his friend. 
12 So at that moment right there, that just 
13 gave me enough time to run outside because like I 
14 said, I thought that he was going for his friend 
15 too, so I didn't want to miss that. So that was my 
16 time when he walked past that was my time to run 
17 outside. 
18 By the time I gets to the door, I notice I 
19 forgot my phone in the bedroom. So I go back, grab 
20 my phone and then I goes back to the front door, 
21 which it didn't take long, just seconds. 
22 So, urn, but about the time I gets outside, 
23 I see Mike Brown, he's now facing the officer, kind 
24 of, he bent down like he was hit in the stomach. He 
25 had both arms wrapped around his stomach and he's

2 So like I said, I thought he was already 
3 shot. And, urn, before he was going down, the 
4 officer lets out four or five more shots. And when 
5 he hit the ground, you know, that's when I see blood 
6 roll over or whatever. 
7 And, urn, the next closest I seen the 
8 officer, when he hit the ground, the officer, he was 
9 at least about 4 or 5 feet away from his body now on 
10 his walkie-talkie, still have his gun all over him 
11 making his call in. And, urn, and that's when my 
12 phone started recording maybe like two minutes right 
13 after when the first two officers come in.

11 enough. Urn, there was definitely close enough so, I

15 just see something going on roughly through the

20 up in his shit punching on him. 
21 Yeah, that's what I assume 
22 because, urn, younger people like that, I think that, 
23 you know, that don't want to go to jail, you know,

14 A Urn, that, urn, one moment, urn, at the time 
15 when the audio came out about the shooting, let me 
16 see, like a week and a half earlier before that I 
17 stopped doing interviews, I didn't receive no calls, 
18 I was fine. I could go home and enjoy. 
19 So when that came out, I started 
20 getting calls again, they was at my house while I 
21 was at work trying to come up to my job.

1 And urn, let's see, maybe the 
2 same day I knew it was on the tube that when it 
3 aired on the news and stuff like that, it was on a 
4 Tuesday or a Wednesday. I had to go pick up my 
5 fiancee about 9:30 that night to leave out of my 
6 house to go pick her up. I know that day I received 
7 a call from a reporter at six something. And 
8 another call at seven or eight something and then I 
9 got a text like just before 9:00. 
10 I had to put up my little son's car seat 
11 in the car. So I went outside to go and do that and 
12 as soon as, right when I gets to my car, a lady just 
13 runs up, it is dark now. And at this time I notice 
14 there is not a lot people out, I know that for sure, 
15 but she just runs up, just runs up, hey, 
16 can you do another interview, you know, but 
17 she was nice. She just ran up, you know, like it 
18 was, I was already scared at that point. 
19 But I just, I looks at a lot of movies and 
20 stuff and it just gets me thinking like, like if 
21 anybody was trying to at that time, you know, that 
22 was a good opportunity at that time. 
23 
24 
You know, I think of stuff like that.

7 MS. And when he's at the car, what 
8 does he do? 
9 He looked at the officer to 
10 make sure the officer's not coming to him. Because

1 ducked down looking at the officer is like each shot

4 that the door was opened, I don't know how wide the 
5 door was open, but each shot that went off, he was 
6 kind of like bam, going over to the side watching 
7 him but then I said that I noticed he went past him. 
8 MS. Let me ask you. When you were 
9 watching the guy with the dreads behind the vehicle 
10 (inaudible) as he is going to the passenger side, 
11 did you then leave from your view as he's going to 
12 passenger side? 
13 No, no, no, I could see him 
14 clear, he didn't hop in until, like he didn't hop 
15 into the vehicle until, uh, I think that he noticed 
16 that his friend now did hit the ground.

18 the vehicle.

So, urn, like I said, when -- I

12 just thinking that he was going for his friend also. 
13 
14 
MS. And you're assuming that?

15 I kept my eyes on both of them. I see one running 
16 straight down the middle, this one is going for the 
17 very first car that he sees. 
18 MS. So you see Michael run down the 
19 street and you see the guy with the dreads run down 
20 to the car?

1 pause by the time he went past this time. So there 
2 is a pause right there during his shooting when, 
3 like I said, I was thinking that he was going to go 
4 to his friend and shoot him. That's why I was main 
5 focusing on him at that point.

7 Brown starts running, your main focus is on the guy

1 was walking by shooting. That's while I was still 
2 in the window and I know that he went past him, 
3 that's when I went outside. 
4 MS. So you say the officer was 
5 shooting, how do you know he was shooting at that 
6 time? 
7 Cause that's when I heard the 
8 gunshots when he's out the vehicle, the moment he 
9 gets out the vehicle. 
10 MS. So what did you do when you 
11 heard gunshots? 
12 I'm still in the window and, 
13 urn, he's shooting, he's walking past his own vehicle 
14 to the back of it. And urn, like I said, the first 
15 vehicle that the guy with the dreads run to, that 
16 vehicle is a little bit behind the police cruiser. 
17 So he walks past that vehicle to where his 
18 friend ran to and walked past that and that's when 
19 my time was to run outside then.

1 outside cause they're shooting. That's when I 
2 notice that he past his friend at that time, so that 
3 just gave me enough time to go outside at that time. 
4 MS. Why did you want to go outside 
5 when there is gunshots being fired? 
6 I mean, like I said, I never 
7 seen nothing like that. You never seen nothing like 
8 that. I know the direction was going straight down 
9 the street going toward somebody that just ran from 
10 the vehicle.

18 that point? 
19 Urn, the moment I gets outside, 
20 Mike Brown is now facing the officer and he got both 
21 his arms on his stomach, like bent down. So I'm 
22 thinking like he's now hit in the stomach somewhere.

1 assuming that he was hit down here somewhere cause 
2 he is like this, urn, curled up. 
3 I remember him taking like two small steps 
4 because he kind of ran past his death spot where he 
5 passed away at, he kind of ran past that. When he 
6 turned around, he got his arms on his stomach, he 
7 bent down, I remember him taking like two small 
8 steps cause he was going like stumbling. 
9 
10 
MS. Okay. 
So, uh, and the officer lets 
11 out four or five more shots at him and he hit the 
12 ground. 
13 MS. So, just so that I will be a 
14 little more clear, I know I keep asking the same 
15 things. When you go outside, you see Michael Brown 
16 facing the officer and you were demonstrating, would 
17 you mind standing up and describing where his hands 
18 were at in the area for the recording?

7 No, no, I just thought he was

1 just see him gets out of the car shooting, you know, 
2 and I'm paying attention to the guy with the dreads. 
3 Cause I'm thinking that he could just easily walk 
4 over and shoot him dead. Like I didn't want to miss 
5 that or something like that, you know. 
6 So it is just, that was just my timing 
7 right there like when I notice that he walked past 
8 the car and that was just my timing right there bam, 
9 he just got done like with a pause or something 
10 because I said when I gets outside, it was still 
11 like three, four, maybe five more shots. 
12 MS. Okay. And what happened when 
13 you got outside, what was the kid with the dreads 
14 doing? 
15 Urn 
16 MS. Did you see him?

18 really kind of stopped paying attention to him. 
19 Because as I said, I did notice that the driver, 
20 passenger side door was open on that car, but I 
21 stopped paying attention to him so, and I started 
22 focusing on Mike Brown cause now he's dead, and the

3 just got in the car and the car had driven off.

5 that was maybe right when he saw his friend die, you

8 actually see him, the kid with the dreads, get in 
9 the car or did you assume he got in the car? 
10 I, I, I assume, I assume that 
11 because the car was gone right after that, the car 
12 was gone. 
13 MS. And where were -- and did the

15 him?

17 and asked to pull off. 
18 MS. Right. You figured that, 
19 right?

21 stopped paying attention when he walked past him.

20 I remember him saying like on a recording that I

Have you seen him since? 
No. 
When this discussion is

7 Yes. 
8 MS. So the recording you provided 
9 St. Louis County, was it from the balcony? 
10 Yeah, it was from the balcony. 
11 MS. Okay. So just help me 
12 understand that. When I watch that recording, it 
13 seemed like, and what you just told me was on the 
14 recording. The person in that car, that burgundy 
15 car down below talking up to you? 
16 Uh, you know, I can't even 
17 remember. I don't know if he came up or not, like 
18 on the steps wise. So I really can't remember. I 
19 really can't remember.

MS. You say a burgundy car? 
Yeah, yeah, I know that when I 
22 went out there onto ground level, that's when I was 
23 really talking to him, but I'm trying to remember 
24 like if at the time when I was recording on my 
25 balcony, if he walked up to the steps, cause I do

5 large steps too, I don't think I missed too much 
6 from that. 
7 So when you said you saw the 
8 officer get out of the car. 
9 Uh-huh. 
10 Did you see what kind of car, 
11 vehicle, he was driving, what type of vehicle 
12 rather? 
13 Urn, it was definitely a truck, 
14 the Tahoes, the Tahoes. 
15 Okay. So when he got out of 
16 the car, and the Tahoe is a pretty big car.

16 Okay. 
17 You know, so. 
18 And you heard the gunshots? 
19 Yeah, that's when I started 
20 hearing the moment he gets out of the vehicle. 
21 I'm sorry, I can't remember

2 That should be about four, 
3 five. 
4 Okay. 
5 Yeah. 
6 MS. If you're not sure, it is fine 
7 to say you're not sure. 
8 Okay. I know it was a nice 
9 round because he gets out of the car immediately and 
10 started shooting, just like I said, each time that 
11 he shot, I was like I said, I feel for the guy with 
12 the dreads. I think of it as a nightmare too 
13 because each time he saw the officer shooting, he 
14 was just like, you know, kind of like, I seen his 
15 body jump just looking at each time like he was like 
16 a duck that he was giving hisself around the 
17 vehicle. So I would have to say about four or five. 
18 MS. Okay. Do you remember when you 
19 first talked to the County detectives, you gave a 
20 recorded interview and a couple minutes later, you 
21 had a follow-up right away and they went back on the 
22 recording, do you remember that? 
23 Urn, with them? 
24 MR. It would be on the same day, 
25 August 9th. It was about four or five hours after

1 all of this happened that day they came and they 
2 talked to you? 
3 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was that 
4 same day. 
5 MS. You gave a recorded statement 
6 and literally within a minute, maybe even seconds 
7 later they went back on the recording. Was there 
8 something that you had asked that you said I wanted 
9 to ask you about. You had said in talking about the 
10 initial altercation, you had said that, urn, that you 
11 heard the shots before the police officer got out of 
12 the car and that's what made the police officer get 
13 out of the car. 
14 So I know that since then and today that 
15 you heard the shots after the cop got out of the 
16 car. Now one point you said that, that is what I 
17 was just wondering. 
18 Urn --
MR. You said, what is 19 
20 referring to, Detective asked you, when did 
21 you hear the first gunshots, you said you heard 
22 gunshots. 
23 You said, I was in window. And Detective 
24 asked you, and where was the officer at that 
25 point.

1 And you said that he was still in the car, 
2 that's when I saw the altercation, whenever it was 
3 happening in the car and the guys ran. 
4 And so at that point you indicated the 
5 first shots were while the officer was still in the 
6 car. 
7 And let me ask you this, kind of, you 
8 mention at the very beginning, I meant to ask you 
9 this earlier, but that the guy with the dreads and 
10 Mike Brown took off running at like the same 
11 instant. 
12 Uh-huh. 
13 MR. Is that right? They both 
14 just took off running at the exact same time? 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 MR. And you hear or seeing 
17 anything that would cause--
18 That's the point, I didn't 
19 even hear a gunshot go off while the officer was in 
20 the car, you know. So like I said, I really didn't 
21 hear. The only thing I heard was a hard tussling, 
22 you know. So that is what drew me to the window, I 
23 could hear everything because it echos, so I could 
24 hear everything, but that is what drew me to the 
25 window.

1 But they did take off at the same time, 
2 but I really, I didn't think that maybe a shot went 
3 off in the car or something because that was a good 
4 timing, you know. 
5 
6 because as 
MS. The reason we ask you is 
just read to you the transcript of 
7 your statement, you said at that point that the shot 
8 had gone off in the car. 
9 Yeah, maybe, I mean, I know 
10 for sure I didn't hear a shot go off in the car, 
11 but, urn, like I said, that's probably wasn't like 
12 the first interview, that's maybe because I'd have 
13 heard that a shot did go off so, you know, I was 
14 trying to put a puzzle together too, maybe that's 
15 the reason why they ran, but I didn't hear. 
16 MS. So there is about four hours 
17 from the time this whole incident occurred to that 
18 the time that the county cops interviewed you. In 
19 those four hours, I know that you videoed a lot of 
20 it, or people on the street, did you talk to your 
21 neighbors, kind of talk --
22 No, because a lot of people 
23 are my neighbors, they didn't see everything. They 
24 didn't see, it was just a main guy got, uh, from 
25 what I saw I kind of, you know, I like his beginning

18 MR. Can you just real quick, can 
19 you tell us what he told you again about what he 
20 saw? 
21 That he said, urn, urn, that the 
22 officer pulls up to them and the officer says 
23 something to them and they say something back, and 
24 he reverses back and like I said, that's why the

2 And he said that he runs over his foot to 
3 catch him or whatever, he said that he reached out 
4 the window to hold him or whatever, and, urn, and 
5 maybe that's where the tussle started at. Going on

MR. Or did the officer say 
something about that to you? 
I don't think that he did, I 
17 think somebody else said that, somebody else that 
18 walked up and said that a gunshot, that's the reason 
19 why they ran so fast so, but I don't remember that 
20 the guy with the purple car that said that to me. 
21 MR. And so as you sit here 
22 today, do you know whether the first shot was, 
23 whether you heard the first shot while they were, 
24 while the police officer is still in the car or 
25 after he got out of the car.

11 because when we do our investigations, we want to

16 Yeah, I mean, yeah, because 
17 like I said, when I see somebody hit a police 
18 officer, here I'm hearing a tussle like that, it 
19 doesn't look right. So I assume that, you know, 
20 some guy just run up to the car and started punching 
21 on him and the officer gets out of the car and 
22 shoots him dead.

2 I mean, if something just come 
3 to my mind, I mean, like the video that I have, 
4 maybe you could check the license plates on that 
5 vehicle.

7 And go from there maybe, I 
8 don't know. 
9 MS. Okay. Is there any other thing 
10 that you know about him? 
11 
12 MS. 
No, that's the only thing. 
Because it just seems kind of 
13 weird to us, right, that this stranger starts coming 
14 up and having a whole discussion with you? 
15 Yeah, I mean, everybody just 
16 started talking to everybody. 
17 
18 
MS. I know. 
Like I said, even when I had 
19 started recording, you know, I started talking of 
20 what I assumed, what I saw. 
21 MS. Right. 
22 Uh, even though I saw him 
23 already at the window, but I just put it to the 
24 point he ran up to the car and started, you know. 
25 MS. What you said was he got up in

1 that officer's shit and started punching him. 
2 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is 
3 exactly I saw. He ran up all up in his shit, 
4 whatever, so. 
5 MS. Is that what you saw, that is 
6 what you saw. 
7 Yeah, but still, I mean, when 
8 I saw this kid be different like, as far as like he 
9 could be grabbed to the car. 
10 MS. Did you see him get grabbed? 
11 No, I didn't see him get 
12 grabbed, but if --
13 Have you ever, I'm going to 
14 take his off, have you ever been in a physical fight 
15 before? 
16 Yes. 
17 Fight with somebody. Now 
18 imagine, did you feel like you were at an advantage 
19 or disadvantage? 
20 I mean, you know, I feel if 
21 you are in a fight sometimes, you know, this guy's 
22 getting an advantage. 
23 Let me ask you, if you are 
24 sitting down and someone was standing, who would you 
25 say had the advantage there?

1 Of course, I believe that's a 
2 truck that, of course, anybody standing out of the 
3 vehicle would have an advantage. 
4 Okay. 
5 Because I've seen it before 
6 with my own eyes, that if a guy gets out of the car, 
7 they get to punching on somebody that's in the car, 
8 you know, because they almost can't do nothing with 
9 two hands, you know. 
10 Okay. 
11 Maybe with one, grab one hand 
12 or whatever, but you know, so that there is anybody 
13 outside the car would have the upper hand, you know, 
14 so I do see that. 
15 And did you see that? 
16 Yeah, I mean, I look at it 
17 like I said, anybody outside the vehicle has the 
18 upper hand. 
19 Right. 
20 I assume, you know, he ran up 
21 to the car and punched him up in his face or 
22 whatever, then they takes off running. 
23 So based on what you saw, did 
24 you see, did you feel that Michael Brown had an 
25 advantage or did you think it was the other way

1 around? 
2 A Uh, I mean, the advantage, he definitely 
3 has an upper advantage if he's throwing punches, if 
4 he's throwing punches from outside the vehicle. So, 
5 but like I said, it could be different reasons why, 
6 you know, he was on the side and then pulling, 
7 trying to be pulled in or something like that, but. 
8 We're not asking you to 
9 figure that out either, so don't feel like you have 
10 to. 
11 Okay. 
12 We're just trying to find 
13 different ways to kind of jog your memory. 
14 Yeah, but anybody standing 
15 outside the vehicle they would have the upper 
16 advantage on throwing punches. 
17 MS. Could I ask you some more about 
18 that guy in the burgundy car? 
19 Yes. 
20 
21 
MS. About how old is he? 
I know he's younger than me, a 
22 lot younger guy. I'm not even sure how old he is, I 
23 know he's younger.

3 my first of two interviews. 
4 MS. Uh-huh.

7 officer let out about eight shots, eight, nine

9 interviews after that, that's when I notice about 
10 the, I saw the autopsy. And I remember telling the 
11 reporter, I said they only found six shells, that 
12 Mike Brown was hit six times, you know. 
13 I was saying like, he only shot six times 
14 through that whole time? So, you know, I was 
15 breaking that down so, but if I even said that to 
16 him, it is probably, you know, because I already 
17 heard somebody said that's the reason why they ran

19 right, I'm just talking about, you know, when you go 
20 back through those statements, there is that one 
21 instance we talked about, you know, where you talk 
22 about the police officer being in the car when you 
23 heard the first shots fired.

4 that the shots occurred, that's all we are trying to 
5 do.

8 touch on that one more time. Can you tell us what 
9 you recall about at that point as you are looking at 
10 the window? 
11 As I'm looking out the window, 
12 I see Mike Brown at the driver's side window of the 
13 police vehicle. I see a tussle, I see his arms 
14 moving, I see the officers arms moving, so I heard a 
15 hard tussling. 
16 Then all of the sudden they just takes 
17 off, they just takes off running. I see his friend, 
18 like I said, he runs to the first car that he sees, 
19 runs behind the trunk of the car because the officer 
20 immediately gets out of his vehicle and started 
21 shooting. So I see him looking at the officers as 
22 he was taking large steps going for Mike Brown. 
23 About the time that I notice that the 
24 officer went past his friend, that's when I came 
25 outside. By the time I gets outside, I see Mike

13 hear those shots, or because you said several times, 
14 I notice in your prior statements that you refer to 
15 hearing them. 
16 Yeah, I saw him. I saw him 
17 shooting at Mike Brown the moment he gets out of the 
18 vehicle.

20 getting out of the vehicle? 
21 Yeah, the moment --

2 I've been eating like 
3 horrible, like once a day, like mostly like at 
4 nighttime. You know, so the whole day I eat little 
5 snacks, I'm not getting full like, you know, 
6 everybody supposed to eat good full like two or 
7 three times a day at least, but I'm not eating much, 
8 not getting as good of sleep. 
9 What's on your mind? 
10 I mean, I don't know just, urn, 
11 maybe just what if what I already did with the 
12 reporters and, you know, I be thinking like somebody 
13 is looking for me, maybe. You know, I just have 
14 weird feelings. 
15 What type of person, what do 
16 you think that you did wrong? 
17 I mean, just the point, urn, I 
18 did quite a few interviews and I don't think, I only 
19 know there's a few witnesses. I think I just 
20 notice --
21 There is only a few witnesses 
22 that went to the media, there is a big difference 
23 between only a few witnesses. 
24 Okay. I don't think they 
25 didn't do as many as I did.

4 immediately felt so worried since then and not 
5 having a lawyer and seeing that on the internet. 
6 MS. Are you worried about being 
7 called a snitch? 
8 No, I'm not worried about 
9 that. I'm hoping, I don't want nothing happening to 
10 me, you know. Maybe if my information is really 
11 good enough or whatever, and you know, I don't want 
12 nobody coming looking for me because I have good 
13 information, whatever the case.

18 
19 
You know, so, I mean.

20 being a good enough witness, there is no such thing

5 concerned about the way (inaudible), that's why you 
6 quit doing media interviews? 
7 No, no, because after that, it 
8 just, I just thought I did so many and all of these 
9 reporters, they was coming to my house, calling my 
10 phone, they coming to my momma's house. I don't 
11 know how they got my momma's address. 
12 They called my next door neighbor, I don't 
13 know how they get her number. They was just like, 
14 when I get home, it has been like a good two weeks 
15 after his death, like they like, when I get home, I 
16 like to straighten out my apartment. I like to 
17 straighten up to make sure everything is right. 
18 I've got kids, you know, I like to 
19 straighten up and relax. That's the first thing I

1 is just when it hit me, that same night after doing 
2 that show, I came back home and my fiancee came home 
3 too, and we kind of had some words exchanged and she 
4 didn't want to give me a kiss or whatever, but 
5 normally when she don't do that, I go up and mess 
6 with her, but I didn't bother her at all about that. 
7 I just went into the kitchen and started 
8 walking around in the kitchen and I started to fix 
9 me a sandwich. As I was fixing a sandwich, I've got 
10 the two (inaudible) out, but I'm just pacing back 
11 and forth in the kitchen. I started sweating and 
12 being real nervous. 
13 So when my fiancee walking around, you 
14 know, with an attitude, I stopped her in the kitchen 
15 and said look, you know, right now, you know, what 
16 you want right now is petty right now, I just want 
17 to tell you that right now. I'm feeling very, very 
18 sick right now, very, very sick. I'm shaking and 
19 I'm nervous right now and I'm scared, you know. 
20 It is just since that day, it has been 
21 kind of different. Like I said, my stomach started 
22 hurting then one morning, on Monday morning, on 
23 Mondays I have to be at work about 6:00 in the 
24 morning to go to the office, but I woke up like five 
25 something with some real chest pains.

2 know, something trying to happen, you know. One 
3 after another, whatever. 
4 I don't know, like I said if I'm just 
5 worried. I be on the highway and a couple of times 
6 I'll be seeing like almost accidents going to happen 
7 or whatever, you know. And like I said, I'm 
8 worried, I be worried. It has been twice I seen 
9 when I leave off work, I gets on the highway, has 
10 been two times I seen a guy on a motorcycle, black 
11 motorcycle, black helmet, black everything, follow 
12 me. I don't know, he wasn't following me though, 
13 but just, you know, I didn't see him in my rear view 
14 at first, but now I see him. 
15 And from St. Charles Rock Road to Lucas 
16 and Hunt, it is kind of a little distance. He was 
17 behind me for a minute and I got to thinking like, 
18 then he zoomed past me and then started catching up 
19 and then he started catching up. And he zoomed in 
20 front of me and then he zoomed in front of another 
21 car and I'm like oh, that could have been an 
22 accident. 
23 I'm just saying, I was looking what if

2 MR. Other than that news 
3 interview you talked about, has anybody confronted 
4 you about this in a way that --
5 No, I know around my 
6 neighborhood and at work, everybody is looking at me 
7 as a super star, you know. When I catch some guys 
8 at the store, have you been on TV. They be wanting 
9 to shake my hand so. I see, you know, in that 
10 community they see me as, I guess, I'm okay, you 
11 know, so. 
12 I do think of the Klu Klux Klan, I do 
13 think of them. You know what, a friend told me 
14 yesterday, I don't know if it is true or not, I 
15 doubt if it's true. He said, uh, that something 
16 happened to Mike Brown's family at their house, like 
17 their house got shot up or something. 
18 I'm asking? 
19 That's what he said, he said that one of 
20 Mike Brown's family's momma house or something got

22 So that is what he tells me last night or whatever.

1 took place for seconds, I'm not sure how long. I 
2 know that it appeared that some confrontation was 
3 taking place. 
4 And one shot, the first shot was let 
5 loose and after the first shot, Mike Brown came out 
6 of the window and took off running. 
7 With that happening, I thought 
8 instantly because the police officer didn't 
9 immediately react on how I would have thought it 
10 would have went down. Where he didn't immediately 
11 get out of his car and chase after Mike Brown. 
12 So my initial thought was that wow, 
13 did I just witness this young guy kill a police 
14 officer. 
15 So after that, Mike Brown ran some 
16 distance, the police officer exited his vehicle with

was already in pursuit of

24 it was a body gesture. And I could say for sure he 
25 never put his hands up after he did his body

1 gesture, he ran towards the officer full charge. 
2 The officer fired several shots at 
3 him and to give an estimate, I would say roughly 
4 around five to six shots was fired at Mike Brown. 
5 Mike Brown was still coming towards 
6 the officer and at this point I'm thinking, wow, is 
7 this officer missing Mike Brown at this close of a 
8 range. 
9 Mike Brown continuously came forward 
10 in the charging motion and at some point, at one 
11 point he started to slow down and he came to a stop. 
12 And when he stopped, that's when the officer ceased 
13 fire and when he ceased fired, Mike Brown started to 
14 charge once more at him. When he charged once more, 
15 the officer returned fire with, I would say, give an 
16 estimate of three to four shots. And that's when 
17 Mike Brown finally collapsed right about even with 
18 this driveway. (indicating)

20 a blue Monte Carlo parked almost right where that

Not really, no. 
Can you see was the vehicle moving at all? 
No. 
Was Mike Brown moving at all? 
It appeared to be. 
Okay. And can you describe, I don't want 
12 to put the words in your mouth, I want you to 
13 describe what you saw when you say it appeared to be 
14 that he was moving? 
15 A It appeared to be some sort of 
16 confrontation taking place in the vehicle. I 
17 couldn't make it out, I couldn't say who did what 
18 within that time span within that vehicle. All I 
19 know is that it just looked out of the norm with 
20 somebody being leaned over inside the police 
21 officer's car. 
22 Q Okay. So did you hear anything, like 
23 yelling, were they yelling at each other or anybody 
24 yelling?

12 the officer, in other words, he got a little bit of 
13 a head start, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
How far was he in front of the officer 
16 when the officer started running? 
17 A I would say the police car is right here, 
18 so Mike Brown maybe was about this far before the 
19 officer exited his vehicle and within that time I 
20 would say the officer maybe was here when Mike Brown 
21 stopped there. 
22 Q Okay. So you initially describe that when 
23 the officer got out of his vehicle, Mike Brown was 
24 close to where this like, this car is on this map?

5 down Canfield? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And then does the officer close the gap or 
8 do they remain, you know, do they remain that 
9 distance apart or does the officer close the gap? 
10 A He starts to close the gap when Mike Brown 
11 stops right here. And I would say the officer is 
12 right at the D, for drive. (indicating)

Do you know, I don't want you to guess, 
17 other than maybe if you observed something that 
18 caused you to assume, but do you know why Mike Brown 
19 stopped and turned around? 
20 A No, I'm not sure. That is something that 
21 I wrestle with to this day, I'm not sure. I'm not 
22 sure if he knew the people that was in that car and 
23 he thought maybe he had time to go back to wrestle 
24 with this officer. To this day, why would he turn 
25 around and not give himself up.

3 anything?

A

6 anything? 
7 A 
No.

10 anything said, you just didn't hear anything? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And so now you testified that when

15 turns around; is that right?

7 right about where the D or the abbreviation for 
8 drive on Canfield Drive would be?

1 Q Can you describe for them what you mean 
2 when you said you saw him do a body gesture. If you 
3 need to stand up to demonstrate, you can do that 
4 too? 
5 A I can't say for sure what sort of body 
6 gesture, I cannot recall fully. All I know is it 
7 was not in a surrendering motion of I'm 
8 surrendering, putting my hands up or anything, I'm 
9 not sure. If it was like a shoulder shrug or him 
10 pulling his pants up, I'm not sure. I really don't 
11 want to speculate things and that's what I have to 
12 say for that. 
13 Q Okay. So turn, Mike Brown turns around, 
14 makes that gesture, then how long before he then 
15 moves in the direction of the officer? 
16 A Immediately after he did his body gesture, 
17 he came for force, full charge at the officer.

A

And full charge, I guess, is running?

12 Brown begin to charge at the officer, how far does 
13 he get before you said the officer fires a number of 
14 shots?

16 Mike Brown gets to right there, even with the car 
17 before the officer starts to fire.

Q 
Uh-huh. 
Why didn't you go up to an officer then 
11 and say, hey, I saw the whole thing or most of it? 
12 
13 
A Because when I went down on the scene 
afterwards, speaking with that I was 
14 speaking to. I wasn't giving a thorough accounting 
15 
16 
on what I had witnessed to , I was, I couldn't 
say giving just a glimpse of what I witnessed 
17 because just observing the chaotic, how it got so 
18 chaotic so quick, and different point of views on, 
19 it didn't add up to what I actually witnessed. 
20 I felt very uncomfortable and I say I 
21 would probably estimate I was down on the scene 
22 maybe five to ten minutes. And just observing 
23 everything and how the uproar became about so 
24 quickly.

2 I felt uncomfortable, I fully felt 
3 uncomfortable when I actually did go forward to the 
4 police station because, urn, I first called in Sunday 
5 after I seen all the rioting. I just felt bad about 
6 the situation. 
7 I knew that I needed to come forward 
8 to let the truth be told. And after seeing the 
9 rioting, I called St. Louis County Police, I just 
10 called the 911 and they took down my information 
11 and, urn, Monday morning I just felt like it wasn't, 
12 I was just going to be pushed to the side. So I 
13 felt like I needed to do more. 
14 I called Ferguson Police Department, 
15 I had to leave a message there and I still wasn't 
16 settled about it. 
17 So I went down to the police station 
18 and I felt uncomfortable then just walking past all 
19 the protesting that was going on, but I knew it was 
20 the right thing to do. It is an unfortunate 
21 situation, but I know God put me in this situation 
22 for a reason.

16 drawn on him and he charged at him and he shot at 
17 him at least five to six times. And the seemed

outside 
He -- he, they both walked past me. I 
went into I came back 
to get some more stuff and I 
6 looked down the street and I seen the police car at 
7 a slant and I seen Mr. Brown in the window of the 
8 police car. It looked, it appeared as they were 
9 wrestling through the window. And one gunshot had 
10 let off and Mr. Brown took off running. 
11 And my first thought was like, oh, my 
12 gosh, did I actually just witness a police officer 
13 being murdered because it took a while for the 
14 police officer to get out of the car and pursue the 
15 suspect. 
16 And I want to say maybe six seconds, but 
17 it seemed like it was forever after the-- the first 
18 gunshot. So the police officer exited the vehicle 
19 with his weapon drawn, pursuing Mr. Brown. 
20 Mr. Brown was quite a distance and he stopped. And 
21 when he stopped, he didn't get down on the ground or 
22 anything, he turned around and he did some type of 
23 movement. I never seen him put his hands up or 
24 anything. I can't recall the movement that he did. 
25 I'm not sure if he pulled his pants up or whatever

1 he did, but I seen some type of movement and he 
2 started charging towards the police officer. 
3 The police officer then returned fire, not 
4 returned fire, open fire on Mr. Brown. Urn, if I had 
5 to guess, the shots and, urn, the distance between 
6 him and Mr. Brown, it would have to be five to 
7 ten yards. 
8 And the shots that were fired was four, 
9 five or six shots fired, and Mr. Brown was still 
10 standing up. Urn, and my thoughts was wow, he's 
11 missing this guy this close, is he hitting him or 
12 because Mr. Brown there was no reaction from him to 
13 show that he was being hit. 
14 Urn, after that, Mr. Brown then paused, 
15 he -- he -- he stopped running and when he stopped 
16 running, the police officer stopped firing. And 
17 then Mr. Brown continued, started again to charge 
18 towards him and after that, the police officer 
19 returned fire and, urn, well, not returned, I'm using 
20 the wrong term, he started to fire once more at him. 
21 Urn, if I had to guess the rounds that were

A Yes. 
Q Which is, I've got the laser pointer, 
17 right on the corner of Canfield Drive and Copper 
18 Creek Court, he never made it that far? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yeah. 
And so you say that at the location where 
21 he ended coming, you know, came to rest, his body 
22 was in the street? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Urn, how much distance farther had he run 
25 before he fell down into the street, do you know

1 what I'm saying? So he runs and then he turns 
2 around? 
3 A Uh-huh. 
4 Q And does he take any steps or come towards 
5 the officer at all?

7 that's where he fell dead at.

Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
I didn't see him take any more steps. 
Let me ask you this, is it possible as you 
11 were trying to make your way in this direction and 
12 watching what was going on, you could have missed 
13 him being close to this corner to where he would 
14 have come 20 feet back toward the officer? 
15 A No, I can't. So whenever I was over this 
16 way, I saw him running past here, but for me to come 
17 across here and him to come all the way, that's not 
18 enough time I don't think. I didn't see him go that 
19 far, not at all. Because whenever I came across 
20 this, whenever I saw the officer coming this way and 
21 he was still coming right there, so he never made it 
22 that far. 
23 Q Okay. So let me tell you something, go 
24 ahead and sit down. So as you park your car, do you 
25 recall which slot you were in right here?

I was in one of those three, I can't 
10 remember exactly where I parked. 
11 Q From where you were parking and you have 
12 to get out of your car, is it possible that you lose 
13 sight of him for a time period or that you can't see 
14 from your location to where he could have been at 
15 that corner? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. So let me ask you this, have you 
18 been out on that street since then?

Q 
No, I don't. 
Okay. Since then you haven't seen the 
21 flowers and memorial? 
22 A I seen pictures in the news and stuff like 
23 that, not myself actually being there, no. 
24 Q Do you have any reason to know why Michael 
25 Brown's blood might have been located in this area?

19 in this direction, you missed a part of that? 
20 A I can't see me missing that part because 
21 whenever I was coming across, I still had sight of 
22 them. I didn't see him go that far. 
23 Q Okay. But you say you saw him turn

3 see his head in the window? 
4 A I saw his head in the window, but not like

6 like kind of pulled back and forth like at the 
7 window. 
8 Q So Michael Brown, do you know how tall he 
9 was?

There was a pause. 
Okay. So Michael Brown, does the pause

7 pauses. I can't say this happened and then a pause, 
8 this happened and then a pause, I wasn't paying 
9 attention like when the gunshots came and when it 
10 stopped.
