GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XIX 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning, it is 
Page 5 
3 Tuesday, November 4th, at 8:46 a.m. This is Kathi 
4 Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, all 12 grand 
5 jurors are present, as is , the court reporter. 
6 And we had a brief discussion before we went on the 
7 record this morning about some matters, about 
8 matters that the grand jury had inquired about, and 
9 I've answered them to the best of my ability. 
10 And, uh, now we discussed that yesterday 
11 we attempted to play a disc for the grand jury which 
12 is marked as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 63, and it is 
13 a disc that contains the statement of 
14 a witness who has testified last week. And we 
15 weren't able to play that for some reason, the disc 
16 doesn't play, can't open it. 
17 So I have another disc that we're going to 
18 play that is also a disc that I received from the 
19 FBI, which is Grand Jury Exhibit 56. 
20 (Deposition Exhibit Number 56 
21 marked for identification.) 
22 
23 
MS. ALIZADEH: And hopefully this will 
play. This is the statement of It 
24 is 29 minutes and 11 seconds long. We do not have a 
25 transcript because this was actually the statement

1 that he made last week. I'm not sure of the date, 
2 but it was done after he came from the State of 
3 to come up here and testify. It was recently 
4 done, we don't have a transcript for that. 
5 So, , if you can transcribe it, but 
6 we will go ahead and pause the recording during the 
7 playing of the disc. And at this time I'm going to 
8 leave the room because we have a witness here who I 
9 would like to speak with before he testifies. And 
10 
11 
12 
so at this time, , if you want to pause that.

recording interview of I am also

Page 8 
Yes, ma'am. 
So we talked a little bit 
3 before the recording started, but we basically just 
4 want to hear what you know about what happened. So 
5 if you tell us what other people told you that's 
6 fine, but just let us know those are what other 
7 people told you. 
8 We're just looking to find, to figure out, 
9 like I said, what happened, we are just looking for 
10 you to tell us the truth. 
11 We tell everybody who comes in here that 
12 it could be a crime to lie to the FBI, it is a crime 
13 to make material false statements to the FBI. 
14 So I'm not assuming you are going to lie, 
15 but we want you to know that, okay? 
16 Yes, ma'am. 
17 MS. All the answers need to be out 
18 loud, we are making a recording. If we ever do a 
19 transcript or you shake your head, obviously, the 
20 recording doesn't pick that up, okay? 
21 Right. 
22 MS. So if you nod your head you are 
23 going to probably hear me say is that a yes or if 
24 you shake your head I will say is that a no, okay? 
25 Yes.

2 don't understand a question that we're asking you, 
3 let us know because we are not trying to trick you, 
4 we are just trying to figure out what happened. So 
5 sometimes we ask bad questions that doesn't make 
6 sense, just let us know. Because if you answer a 
7 question we are going to assume that you understood, 
8 it is that fair?

9 Yes, ma'am, Michael Brown. 
10 He starts to fall forward, Michael Brown starts to

12 two more times as he's falling forward and then 
13 after that he stops. 
14 MS. Okay. When you walk out onto 
15 the balcony, was the police officer already 
16 shooting? 
17 No, ma'am.

13 said something about Mike Brown took a step towards 
14 him, couldn't tell what exactly if he was stumbling 
15 or if he was taking a step, can you describe that? 
16 Well, it looked like as if 
17 he was just falling, I mean. But he took his step,

15 No, not that I know of. 
16 MR. You said initially that 
17 people were talking about what went on at the side 
18 of the police car. You said that when you saw it 
19 you didn't really see anything that happened there 
20 and you didn't know if he was inside the car or not, 
21 but other people were talking about that, remember 
22 that?

5 you have any idea what happened from the time the 
6 police first pulled up there until the time the 
7 policeman fired those last four or five shots, do 
8 you know what went on there at all based on what you

I felt that the police

Page 30 
1 officer did that very unjustly, he overkilled 
2 basically. After the first shot, I mean, he didn't 
3 really have to shoot the young man in the first 
4 place. They have other means of, you know, 
5 corralling the suspect, you know, taser, anything 
6 else. 
7 He shot him the first time, even if you 
8 did have to shoot him, he didn't have to keep going, 
9 he didn't have to kill him because he was unarmed. 
10 MR. From what you saw that day, 
11 could you tell why the police officer shot at Mike 
12 Brown? 
13 I'm not sure why. 
14 MR. Okay. 
15 MS. And you don't know what 
16 happened in the car, right? 
17 No, ma'am.

19 happened while you were inside, correct? 
20 
21 
22 
MS. 
MR. 
No, ma'am. 
Okay. 
That's one of the reasons 
23 I'm asking because on that video you referred to, 
24 you said he shot him like six times. And you said 
25 for no reason, do you recall that?

2 MR. Is it fair to say you didn't 
3 see what happened before those last four or five 
4 shots; is that right? 
5 
6 MR. 
Yes, sir. 
So do you know what the 
7 reason was the police officer shot him, if any? 
8 No, sir. 
MR. Okay. That's fair enough. 
MS. I think when you originally 
9 
10 
11 spoke to the FBI in you heard like two shots 
12 when you were inside, did you hear two or one or not 
13 sure? 
14 I'm not sure. I heard one 
15 for sure, I know that for sure. 
16 MS. And just so you know what I'm 
17 looking at, when you are interviewed by the FBI 
18 though and what you said, that's all I'm looking at. 
19 So it is a summary of what you told them. 
20 MR. After that one shot that 
21 you're sure you heard while you were inside, you 
22 didn't hear any other shots after that until the 
23 four or five that you actually saw?

25 remember.

6 your cell phone, you hear at least one shot inside? 
7 Yes, sir. 
MR. You mentioned two before, as 8 
9 said at the FBI you mentioned two. You 
10 remember one for sure, maybe two, and then is it

1 are talking and deliberating somebody can be looking 
2 through this as kind of to read for the rest of 
3 them. 
4 And I will tell you that at the end of the 
5 transcript there is an index and it will tell you 
6 what page and line a certain word appears on. So if 
7 you know what you are looking for, you could 
8 probably go back and search for it by referring to 
9 the index. 
10 For example the word easy, you recall he 
11 said something was easy, you know, and you're not 
12 sure about that. You might look back and find the 
13 word easy and you find that it appears on page 265

15 to kind of reference if you are looking for 
16 something in particular. 
17 So I will give this to you now. You can 
18 look at it during the lunch hour and if you guys 
19 decide each one want your own copy, I can make

20 Q And so the toxicology is the study of the 
21 harm of toxic effects and the forensic part of it is 
22 the legal application and conclusions?

1 County, back in August of 2014, did you receive some 
2 samples from a deceased person named Michael Brown? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And those, what were the samples that you 
5 received? 
6 A Oh, blood, urine and I think vitreous, or 
7 eye fluid. 
8 Q So samples that were obtained by someone 
9 else were preserved and then delivered to your 
10 laboratory; is that correct?

Yes, the samples were taken at autopsy. 
And is your laboratory in the same

Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going to hand you a 
1 
2 
3 copy of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 66. Is that the 
4 report that you made or a copy of the report that 
5 you did after testing samples that you received from 
6 the deceased, Michael Brown? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q All right. And I've made a copy of these 
9 as well for the grand jurors. And actually, I'm 
10 going to give one to the court reporter so he can 
11 have, some of the words are difficult for me to 
12 pronounce and spell. 
13 So, , first off, let me ask 
14 you, when the human body ingest a chemical or a 
15 substance, does the body process that over time? 
16 A Oh, absolutely. 
17 Q Okay. So if someone ingest a chemical or 
18 substance and then that person dies, does the body 
19 continue to process that chemical after death? 
20 A Well, when you are referring to 
21 processing, that is an energy requiring step, like 
22 the liver metabolism. When a person expires, the 
23 energy stops so there is no more metabolism. 
24 However, there are further reactions that go on just 
25 because there is certain enzymes, decomposition, PH,

1 things of that nature that can alter the drug 
2 concentration. 
3 Q Okay. So let me ask you from the time 
4 that the sample is retrieved from the deceased and 
5 then if it is properly preserved or maintained, is 
6 that sample going to degrade over time so that 
7 whatever chemicals may be found within that sample 
8 might change over time? 
9 A There can be some degradation, but as soon 
10 as the sample is drawn, it is refrigerated and then 
11 we start performing the test on it right away. So 
12 anything along those lines is minimal. 
13 Q Do you recall when it was that you 
14 obtained these samples or got them out again, your 
15 process or testing them? 
16 A Yeah, we received them August 11th of 
17 2014. 
18 Q And so if Michael Brown passed on 
19 August 9th and the autopsy was conducted on 
20 August lOth, Sunday, and then you received those 
21 samples on that Monday? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when you receive the samples, did it 
24 appear to you that they had been properly packaged 
25 and that they had been refrigerated properly?

A Yes, ma'am. 1 
2 Q Okay. So now you mentioned that you had 
3 received urine and blood and you said vitreous 
4 fluid, what is vitreous fluid? 
A Vitreous fluid is the fluid in your eye 5 
6 that keeps it round, okay. It is the fluid in the 
7 eyeball. 
8 Q And what is it, why would it be important 
9 to have a sample of the fluid in the deceased 
10 eyeball? 
11 A Well, see there is several things that can 
12 go on with your chest cavity, even motor vehicle 
13 accidents, trauma to the chest, you can get 
14 contamination of everything in here, okay. 
15 The eyeball, because it is so 
16 protected in the skull, if something happens to it, 
17 any trauma you don't have it because it ruptures. 
18 So other than that, you get a very good sample, 
19 relatively clean and pure sample and it represents 
20 the brain concentration, okay. So it is very close 
21 to whatever is in the brain to give you a handle on 
22 that. 
23 Q Now, in this particular case, did you test 
24 the vitreous fluid from Michael Brown? 
25 A

Page 46 
Q And why didn't you do that? 1 
2 A Well, in our case there was no reason to 
3 because of the nature of the drugs that we found, 
4 they don't get to the vitreous. It just takes too 
5 long and they are not present. 
6 The vitreous is very slow for 
7 equilibration. That is the concentration goes up in 
8 the blood and then it declines and the vitreous lags 
9 on some drugs. On these drugs the vitreous stays 
10 very low, the drugs do not penetrate into the 
11 vitreous. 
12 Q So you tested blood and urine that you had 
13 received from Michael Brown, correct? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And we'll talk about the actual process of 
16 testing those, but did you first do a test on the 
17 blood for alcohol? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And you don't need to go into that 
20 necessarily because the tests of the blood for 
21 alcohol, which are ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and 
22 methanol were all negative, correct? 
23 A Well, we list those, but we test for 
24 others, like toluylenes, Xylene, and so forth. 
25 Q And so you had, is it true then that all

Page 47 
1 of the tests for alcohol were negative on -- in your 
2 test of the blood of Michael Brown? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Now, let me ask you this. If there was a 
5 subsequent test done on a sample of blood that was 
6 done by another professional, and if they had 
7 actually had a different finding that perhaps had a 
8 level of .023, how would you describe, do you have 
9 an explanation as to why that could be positive, 
10 another test done later? 
11 A Sure. The reason for that is 
12 decomposition. As I said, the longer a sample sits 
13 and then transport and everything else that goes 
14 along with it, you can get a little bit of alcohol 
15 generated. And .02 is nothing, so it would just be 
16 decomposition. 
17 Q So that could possibly be explained by the 
18 decomposition that occurred in the sample? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And, all right. So let's talk about the 
21 drug screening for the blood that you ran. And if 
22 everybody can refer to your report on Grand Jury 
23 Exhibit 66, which I don't think I marked actually on 
24 your report, there are a number of drugs that you 
25 tested for; is that correct?

Page 48 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q And every one of those tests was negative 
3 except for the test for cannabinoids, correct? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q And so just to be clear, when you say you 
6 have a negative test, is there like a threshold or a 
7 level that could be present but not detected? 
A Yes. 8 
9 Q And so when you run tests for various 
10 chemicals, if the level that is detected in the 
11 sample that falls below a threshold, then that is 
12 considered a negative, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q All right. And so you receive negative 
15 reading on amphetamines, antidepressants, 
16 barbiturates, and all the other drugs that you 
17 tested for except for the cannabinoids, correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
All right. So explain, Dr. , when you 
20 tested the blood and you were looking for positive 
21 or negative affects, explain the testing procedure 
22 or process that you used to get a negative or a 
23 positive reading? 
24 A See, we use a scatter approach. And that 
25 is we use what's called an immunoassay. An

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Page 49 
1 immunoassay is an allergic reaction in a test tube 
2 to a class of compounds such as amphetamines, 
3 opiates, phencyclidine and so forth. What happens 
4 is we mix the sample with the antibody and if we get 
5 a reaction, then we know it is present or it is 
6 indicated as present. 
7 That has to go on for further 
8 confirmation, which in our case is always gas 
9 chromatography mass spectrometry. And what that 
10 does is give you molecular structure identification. 
11 The molecules introduced into the instrument, and 
12 chromatography means separation. So gas 
13 chromatography means separation at the gas phase. 
14 So what we'll do is separate out all 
15 of these compounds and then introduce them into the 
16 mass analyzer. The mass analyzer hits the molecule, 
17 sort of like my hand here, with very high energy 
18 causing it to explode and that gives you fingerprint 
19 identification. That's how we identify each of the 
20 drugs. We look to see the ions that are present, 
21 the ratios and so forth, other criteria that gives 
22 us the identification on that. 
23 That is also quantitive, telling us 
24 how much is present. So that's the one part. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
The other part is we run a gas

1 chromatography for the other drugs and this will 
2 pick up everything from strychnine to ectasy, and 
3 pick all of those up on one screen. And 
4 unfortunately, we have even seen strychnine cases. 
5 If I didn't like you, that's what I'd use. That's a 
6 nasty poison. 
7 Q Good to know. 
8 A If I can, what it does it causes 
9 constriction of all the muscles in your body. And 
10 your back can actually constrict to a point where 
11 you break your own back. Yeah, so it is nasty. But 
12 that screen will pick up everything. And again, all 
13 of that would have to go on for further 
14 confirmation. 
15 Q So your initial testing of the blood 
16 sample was the allergic reaction test that gives you 
17 an indication that the drug is present? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Now, did you, now, the gas

And this is an instrument that is used in

1 every laboratory in the country, is that fair to 
2 say? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Very well accepted as what it does and 
5 what it can do? 
6 A Absolutely. 
7 Q And the GCMS instrument that is in your 
8 laboratory, is it, do you check that on a regular 
9 basis to make sure that it is calibrated properly 
10 and giving you proper readings? 
11 A Yes. We run it through a whole series. 
12 We do what's called an auto-tune, which is a 
13 compound is entered into it and we have to see a 
14 particular fingerprint analysis. We then run 
15 standards, controls to make sure that the test is 
16 running properly. So everything is fully 
17 controlled. 
18 Q All right. And how often do you do those 
19 checks to make sure that the instrument is working 
20 properly? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Every time we run the instrument. 
How many samples at a time can this 
23 instrument run? 
24 A Probably about 50, but out of that 
25 10 percent are control samples, so run a control

1 periodically. 
2 Q And so out of the 40 that are not control 
3 samples, are these all 40 samples from the same 
4 subject? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
You might have John Doe's blood, you might 
7 have Michael Brown's blood, you might have Suzie Q's 
8 blood? 
9 A That's correct, there is no identification 
10 as to the person when it is going through the 
11 instrument. All we have is a number that's 
12 associated with a particular person. 
13 Q So how is it that you insure that these 
14 samples don't get mixed up? 
15 A Well, it is all done under chain of 
16 custody and everything is sequenced and when we load 
17 it into the instrument to check it and then the 
18 person who takes the data off checks the same 
19 sequence to make sure it's correct. And we also run 
20 the samples, well, not on marijuana. We only do the 
21 blood and urine ones. The other drugs are run 
22 differently. 
23 Q Okay. And so let's talk about the 
24 positive test that, positive result that you got for 
25 the cannabinoids, what is a cannabinoid?

Page 53 
1 A That's marijuana basically. Cannabinoid 
2 is the class of compounds, it's marijuana. 
3 Q All right. So once you received the 
4 positive for cannabinoids, did you then run the 
5 blood through the GCMS? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And when you ran the blood of Michael 
8 Brown through the GCMS, did you just check for 
9 cannabinoids or do you check for all these other 
10 drugs that you indicate was negative? 
11 A No, we specifically look for the 
12 cannabinoids. Delta-9, 11-Hydroxy and the carboxy. 
13 The reason for that is it is what's called a dwell 
14 time. It is how long the instrument gets to look 
15 for a particular compound. 
16 Because we are dealing with 
17 nanograms, which are basically a billionth of a 
18 gram. It is like you have a dollar, that's as close 
19 as you are to be being a billionaire, that's what we 
20 are looking for. 
21 So the instrument really has to focus 
22 in. We can do screens, but that's under a different 
23 criteria. For this we would just use, focus the 
24 instrument in on the cannabinoids. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
All right. And so when you ran the blood

1 sample of Michael Brown through the GCMS, did you 
2 get any quantitative information about, you had 
3 talked about Delta-9, hydroxy and the carboxy 
4 levels, did you get quantitive information about 
5 those? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And so let's talk about what is the 
8 difference between the Delta-9, hydroxy and carboxy. 
9 And for everybody's clarification, the Delta-9, is 
10 Delta-9-THC on your report, correct, and the hydroxy 
11 is 11-Hydroxy-THC. And then the carboxy, which is 
12 what we are calling it, is actually 
13 11-NOR-Delta-9-COOH, correct? 
14 A Yes. 
15 
16 
Q And so is that COOH the carboxy? 
A Yes. 
17 Q Okay. So it doesn't say carboxy, that is 
18 what we are referring to, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
When we talk about carboxy. So can you 
21 explain to the grand jurors, what are these 
22 compounds and how are they different? 
23 A Okay. The first compound, the Delta-9, is 
24 the reason you smoke marijuana. That produces the 
25 desired affects, the euphoria.

1 When it is in your body your body 
2 looks at it as a foreign substance. So it starts to 
3 metabolize or alter it chemically. One of the 
4 things it forms is the 11-Hydroxy-THC. 
5 This is also a psychoactive compound, 
6 but rarely do we find it because it is so short 
7 lived in the human body. And then it goes on 
8 further to be metabolized into the carboxy. We call 
9 it carboxy because the full name for it is 
10 11-NOR-Delta-9-Tetrahydro-Cannabinoid-Carboxylic 
11 acid.

13 carboxy.

15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Which I can't say so we will call it 
That's why we call it carboxy. 
Okay. 
And that's the final metabolite. That's 
17 the compound you hear, well, if you smoke a joint, 
18 you can test positive for a month, which isn't true, 
19 but that's what you hear. 
20 Q So does, so you explained that the 
21 Delta-9-THC has a psychoanalytic effect? 
22

Q 
Psychoactive.

1 Q And then the Hydroxy-THe, does that have a 
2 psychoactive effect on the human body? 
3 A Yes, it does. But as I said, we rarely 
4 find it. Only in a very, very acute use with death 
5 following. 
6 Q And then on the 11-Hydroxy molecule. 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q Is there a psychoactive effect on the body 
9 for that? 
10 A No, you could eat a pound of it, it 
11 wouldn't do anything. 
12 Q Okay. So why is it that these, why is it 
13 that it is important to test for all three of these 
14 compounds when you are testing the cannabinoids? 
15 A Well, for example, suppose you only had 
16 the Delta-9 and nothing else, that would raise 
17 severe questions about the sample. You want to see 
18 the parent drug, the 11-Hydroxy right off, you know 
19 it is not going to be there, and you want to see the 
20 Carboxy-THe. That tells you the drug was consumed 
21 by the individual and it was being metabolized. 
22 So you have a good handle on its use 
23 and one verifies the other. Much the same as we do 
24 in a tube biologicals like blood and urine. The 
25 reason for that is it avoids any question was it

1 contaminated or mixed up. 
2 If we find it in the blood, we want 
3 to find it in the urine because one validates the 
4 other. 
5 Q Okay. And so in this testing, going off 
6 what you said there, you ran the sample of urine 
7 that you had received from Michael Brown that was 
8 received from Michael Brown. You ran those same 
9 three for those three compounds. Delta-9, hydroxy 
10 and the carboxy, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So let me ask you because we can see from 
13 your report that you, when you ran this through the 
14 GCMS you got for the Delta-9-THC, you got 12 
15 nanograms per milliliter. Yet when you ran the 
16 urine you got negative for the Delta-9-THC? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Isn't that inconsistent, why would that be 
19 different? 
20 A No, well, the Delta-9-THC is subject to 
21 other things particularly in the urine. It can even 
22 bind up to the plastic in the container, the urinary 
23 excretion due to dilution. Any one of a number of 
24 things can cause the urine to be negative for the 
25 Delta-9.

1 If it was negative for the carboxy, 
2 that would be a real concern, but not for the 
3 Delta-9. 
4 Q Is the fact that the blood was 12 
5 nanograms per milliliter and the urine was negative, 
6 does that tell you anything about the recency the 
7 drug may have been ingested? In other words, I 
8 assume the urine is the final process of the body, 
9 processing the substance, correct? 
10 A The urine serves to get rid of chemicals 
11 in your body, okay. That's probably the main group. 
12 What you are looking at, the urine really doesn't 
13 count as far as the interpreting it. The Delta-9 in 
14 the blood tells you because Delta-9 in the blood 
15 only hangs around for a short period of time, like 
16 maybe two hours. It has a relatively short half 
17 life. It is in, produces its affects, the affects 
18 last longer in the presence of the Delta-9, but when 
19 you have it in there it goes to acute use, that's 
20 within a couple of hours. 
21 Q Okay. So, and you also had mentioned that 
22 depending upon the sample that in the urine, the 
23 urine sample could be diluted? In other words, 
24 there could be more water in the urine or other 
25 liquids or chemicals?

1 A Yes, it depends on the location of the 
2 urine, how the kidneys were functioning, what's 
3 going on in the body and there is a lot of variables 
4 there. That's why you can't interpret urine 
5 concentration as far as impairment, you just don't 
6 know. 
7 Q Okay. So then the next chemical or 
8 compound was the hydroxy, which was negative when 
9 you tested it in the blood, but it was greater than 
10 25 nanograms per milliliter when you tested it in 
11 the urine? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Why is that not inconsistent? 
The urine serves to collect and 
15 concentrate waste products. The body looks at 
16 metabolites, and actually the Delta-9 is waste 
17 product it wants to get rid of it. 
18 Q So can you draw any conclusions about the 
19 time or the recency of the ingestion of the THC 
20 based upon the fact that the hydroxy was negative in 
21 the blood and yet greater than 25 nanograms in the 
22 urine? 
23 A Well, that alone would put it within ten 
24 hours because you find it in the urine, but a short 
25 half life, maybe a little less than that. So really

1 it wouldn't narrow it down very much. The Delta-9 
2 in the blood is the key. 
3 Q And then your, the levels that you 
4 detected in the urine for the hydroxy, as well as 
5 the Delta-9-Carboxy, those are quantified as greater 
6 than so many nanograms, is that a cutoff level that 
7 the lab has? 
8 A In our quantitation, we run a series of 
9 standards going up the long. Okay. If it exceeds 
10 our upper limit, we just report it as greater than 
11 because it is an academic number. 
12 Q Okay. So there's no conclusion that you 
13 could draw then that if it is greater than 25 
14 nanograms, we can't say that. Well, then it was, 
15 could have been 100 nanograms, which would be four 
16 times any level? 
17 A You can't say anything based on a urine 
18 concentration for THC. 
19 Q Okay. And so then let's talk about then 
20 the testing, you mention the carboxy level in the 
21 blood that you found. And you also said that you 
22 would be concerned if you did not have carboxy if 
23 you had a positive for the Delta-9-THC, but no 
24 carboxy that would be problematic? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, that would be inconsistent.

1 Q So in this case you detected 45 nanograms 
2 per milliliter of the carboxy in the blood of 
3 Michael Brown, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q And is that, can you draw any conclusions 
6 from that the fact that it was also present in the 
7 urine or the fact that it was 12 nanograms that the 
8 THC, Delta-9THC was 12 nanograms per milliliter and 
9 the carboxy was 45 nanograms per milliliter. Can 
10 you draw any conclusions about the time of the 
11 ingestion of the THC from that? 
12 A Well, not from the urine, no, but as I 
13 said, from the blood THC, yes. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A That is really a hard marker for a couple 
16 of hours. The urine can easily test positive for a 
17 couple of days for the Carboxy-THe. And if you are 
18 smoking like a rastafarian type stogey, it can go 
19 longer. 
20 Q Can you tell anything from your findings 
21 about the, about the, I don't know how to phrase 
22 this, about how often the person may have ingested 
23 THC? In other words, would numbers look different 
24 if you were testing a sample from a chronic 
25 marijuana user, somebody that smoked daily, maybe

1 multiple times a day? 
2 A You can't tell the difference between an 
3 acute dose and a chronic dose in one snapshot. 
4 Q When you say acute dose, in your lingo 
5 acute means? 
6 A Say within a couple of hours versus 
7 somebody who smokes every day for a month or two. 
8 Q Okay. So from your findings you can't 
9 conclude that Michael Brown was a chronic marijuana 
10 user versus perhaps this was just an acute dose. In 
11 other words, something that was taken within a 
12 couple of hours prior to his death? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 Q Okay. Now, the 12 nanograms per 
15 milliliter for the THC, you stated that that is the 
16 compound that makes people feel the affects of 
17 marijuana? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
How would you describe, or what do you 
20 conclude from that finding that there were 12 
21 nanograms per milliliter in his blood? 
22 A The Delta-9 is psychoactive, that means it 
23 has an affect. So when you have a drug that is 
24 psychoactive in your blood stream, it is having an 
25 affect.

1 You can argue, well, more effect, 
2 less effect, you can argue that yes, but it is 
3 definitely having an affect on you. When you start 
4 looking at it in terms of the overall, well, 
5 marijuana generally, you know, you smoke a joint and 
6 you chill out, that's generally what happens. Okay 
7 does that have to happen? No, it doesn't. There is 
8 a lot of other variables that are associated with it 
9 that depends on your basic chemistry, your basic who 
10 you are as it were. 
11 So that it can have somewhat 
12 different affects. Add to that the question of 
13 dose. If you take, take alcohol. You have a glass 
14 of wine with dinner, okay, or whatever with dinner, 
15 that's one way of doing it. 
16 You are getting the drug, it is 
17 psychoactive, it is having an affect on you. Now 
18 instead you have a quart with dinner, a quart of 
19 scotch. Well, that's going to produce a very 
20 different effect. It is a function of the 
21 concentration, how much goes in you. 
22 Same thing is true with marijuana. 
23 You can get desirable affects one level, but if you 
24 get a massive dose, and you have to remember 
25 marijuana is not regulated. So you don't know the

1 purity you are getting. You don't know if you are 
2 getting Illinois ditch-weed or Acapulco Gold, for 
3 lack of a better example, okay. So it could be very 
4 low purity or very high purity. 
5 Again, the same thing can happen. It 
6 is like having a glass of wine with dinner versus a 
7 bottle of scotch. You can get very different 
8 affects depending on how much you use. 
9 Q Is there also a variable that would 
10 perhaps effect how it was felt by the person 
11 depending on their body mass or their weight? So, 
12 in other words, if a smaller, we know this to be 
13 true with alcohol, a smaller person can have a glass 
14 of alcohol and a larger person maybe twice or three 
15 times the size can have the same amount of alcohol 
16 and the smaller person's blood alcohol level will be 
17 higher, you would expect it, would that be correct? 
18 A Yes. See, marijuana is technically 
19 classified as a hallucinogen. Cause what it does is 
20 it alters your perception of your surroundings. How 
21 you see things, okay. What information comes into 
22 your mind. It slows it down and distorts it. That 
23 is why it is classified as hallucinogen. 
24 Technically speaking, I mean, you are 
25 not look at pretty birds and flying snakes and so

1 forth, but you are altering your perception of 
2 senses. That's a function of dose. So the more you 
3 have in you, the more effect you can get out of it. 
4 Some people, for example, with 
5 marijuana, it is bound up to nonspecific fat sites. 
6 So if you smoke a joint the first time, you don't 
7 really get a good buzz out of it. The reason for 
8 that is the drug is binding up to nonspecific fat so 
9 it is not hitting your brain, it is not giving you 
10 the effect. 
11 After a couple of times these 
12 nonspecific sites are filled. So the drug is now 
13 free, it gets to your brain and produces, gets to 
14 the threshold and starts producing the effect. 
15 The more you have, the greater the 
16 effect, and it becomes variable at high end. So if 
17 you have, take a mil of highly concentrated 
18 Delta-9THC, that will give you a completely 
19 different effect in smoking a joint. A lot of the 
20 studies they have even done with injections. They 
21 can't really, with alcohol it is straight line 
22 depressant. That just means the more you drink, the 
23 more it depresses you. I don't mean sad, I mean 
24 your nervous system. It slows it down, stops it 
25 from working, makes you goofy, okay.

1 With THC you can come up, you hit a 
2 certain threshold level that will produce an affect. 
3 As you go up from there, if you take a massive dose, 
4 you can get significantly different affects. Those 
5 affects that are not generally associated with 
6 marijuana. 
7 Q So we've discussed a little bit last week, 
8 Sheila and I had a long conversation with you as 
9 well this morning, I spoke with you, we talked about 
10 the affects that you might see or experience, a 
11 person might experience if they were ingesting THC.

Q 
A 
Page 67 
And then would there be hallucination? 
It is possible to go to a full-blown 
3 hallucination, yes. 
4 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Paranoia and psychotic episodes. 
So when we talked about, you had mentioned 
7 when we talk about hallucinations, it doesn't mean 
8 the person sees pink elephants. It means that 
9 they're not perceiving reality the way it is, 
10 correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. And so if you have a massive dose 
13 of THC, could you experience the hallucination 
14 and/or the psychosis if you had a high enough dose 
15 of THC? 
16 A If you got a high enough dose, you could 
17 have a psychotic episode into hallucinations, yes. 
18 Q Now, in this particular case when you 
19 tested the blood and you got 12 nanograms per 
20 milliliter for the Delta-9-THC, do you consider that 
21 a high dose? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Okay 
What conclusions did you make from that? 
Well, you have to put things in 
25 perspective. This was a very large individual, I 
FAX 314-241-6750

Page 68 
1 think he was about 300 pounds. So for concentration 
2 of 12 nanograms in a large person, that shows it was 
3 a large dose. 
4 In a small person, say like 
5 100 pounds to get to 12 nanograms wouldn't take a 
6 lot. A single joint could easily do that. But when 
7 you talk about a larger body mass, just like 
8 drinking alcohol, larger persons can drink more 
9 alcohol because they have the receptacle to hold it. 
10 Q Now, let's compare, because I think most 
11 of us probably have had the experience of consuming 
12 alcohol and over time feeling the affects of 
13 alcohol. And, you know, so, for example, one of the 
14 things that I think we all can probably relate to is 
15 that, for example, if I were to consume a certain 
16 amount of alcohol and my mother who doesn't drink 
17 might consume the same amount of alcohol, we have 
18 the same body mass, she may experience different 
19 affects than I might because I have experienced 
20 drinking alcohol. 
21 Now, some people call that tolerance, 
22 is there any similar effect from people that are 
23 used to using marijuana, could they have the same 
24 levels in their system but experience different 
25 feelings?

1 A Well, of course different people with the 
2 same concentration can experience different 
3 feelings. But see, with marijuana, like your 
4 example was the correct straight line depressant. 
5 With marijuana it's the reverse. So the person who 
6 is naive will get much less affects than a person 
7 who has been using it and that's due to the non 
8 specificity of binding sites. 
9 Q So based upon your finding that there were 
10 12 nanograms of THC, 12 nanograms per milliliter of 
11 Delta-9-THC in Michael Brown's blood, first off, can 
12 you make any conclusions from your findings within a 
13 reasonable degree of toxicology certainty or as to 
14 the recency in which he may have ingested the THC? 
15 A Yes, it is within a couple of hours, maybe 
16 two, three hours on the outside. 
17 Q Can you make any conclusions or do you 
18 have an opinion as to the dose that Michael Brown 
19 may have ingested based upon your tests and your 
20 test results? 
21 
22 
A Given his large body mass, yes. It would 
have been a very significant dose. It wouldn't be 
23 just toking on like a simple joint. 
24 Q Now, based upon your testing and your 
25 conclusions, can you make any conclusions about the

Page 70 
1 level of impairment that Michael Brown may have 
2 experienced if, before he passed? 
3 A I can't tell you how he was impaired. It 
4 is like predicting what somebody would do. I can't 
5 tell you that. I can tell you that the drug is 
6 present at a significant concentration that 
7 represents a large dose into Mr. Brown. 
8 How he would have behaved and what he 
9 would have done I cannot predict. I know the drug 
10 was having an affect and was impairing his nervous 
11 system. 
12 Q You would consider he was impaired in some 
13 way? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q But you cannot draw any conclusions that 
16 he was suffering or that he was experiencing 
17 hallucinations or having a psychotic break? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Urn, we discussed when we came out to talk 
20 to you last week, we also discussed with you, we 
21 asked you if you were familiar with the process 
22 called waxing? 
23 A Yes.

25 with what that is?

Page 71 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q Can you describe for the grand jurors what 
3 you understand waxing to be and what happens? 
4 A Waxing is a process of concentrating the 
5 Delta-9 present in marijuana. It uses gases like 
6 butane and basically it extracts the Delta-9 out of 
7 the marijuana and it is in a highly concentrated 
8 form. So you get a lot more bang for the buck out 
9 of it. 
10 Q So you can ingest a smaller piece or 
11 smaller physical quantity and get a more 
12 concentrated level of THC? 
13 A A much greater effect, yes. 
14 Q Okay. And is there any difference if you 
15 ingest a much higher concentration of THC, is there 
16 a difference in how quickly you would feel those 
17 affects or how long it would last? 
18 A Well, it would depend at that point if you 
19 were inhaling it, putting it under your tongue, 
20 smoking it, however you were doing it. But 
21 generally speaking, it is less than ten minutes. 
22 Q And less than ten minutes for you to feel 
23 the affects or it would last less than ten minutes? 
24 A No, for you to feel the affects. The 
25 affects would come within ten minutes.

8 that would indicate or that legally would indicate 
9 someone is presumed impaired.

13 those states have legalized marijuana either 
14 medically or in the case of California 
15 recreationally or Colorado, correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And we discussed the fact that those 
18 states have made determinations as to the level that 
19 they would if they detect in the person's blood that 
20 would indicate impairment much in the same way that 
21 alcohol level of .08 is presumptively in most

23 impaired.

19 Michael Brown ingested through the waxing method 
20 that you discussed, would the butane appear in his 
21 body?

23 it here on the desk, talked to you and go back, it's 
24 gone. So it is extremely volatile.

1 actually checked to see if butane was in his brain? 
2 A Yes, that's part of our routine. We would 
3 check for volatiles such as butane, other inhalants. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Obviously, it didn't 
5 appear it is so volatile or whatever. There is no 
6 way to know whether or not he participated in waxing

18 that is correct. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: But based upon the levels

1 question about a person's hydration level, how that 
2 affects the test. Either prior to or even in this 
3 incident the individual on the street in August for 
4 four plus hours, do you know how that may effect the 
5 result in any way, if it would? 
6 A Okay. What you are looking at there is an 
7 alteration between the water and the fat in your 
8 body and you are depleting the water, so the fat 
9 becomes a hire percentage. Not a lot of difference 
10 because we lose too much water, you have electrolyte 
11 imbalance, you have a heart attack and die. So 
12 there is a difference on that. 
13 On a drug like marijuana where it is 
14 highly lepid soluble, fat soluble, it would just 
15 have more, it would soak up more of it. That's all

Dr. , with 
21 reference to the psychotic affects of certain types 
22 of drugs, specifically THC. Can you explain to me, 
23 trying to think how to phrase this. For someone who 
24 is at a certain level, you mention that if they 
25 smoked for a month at a time or two weeks at a time,

1 they can build up a certain level in their body. 
2 Can a massive dose at any particular point produce 
3 an entirely different affect than what a person is 
4 used to, you know what I'm saying? 
5 A Yes. 
6 It is kind of hard to 
7 explain. If somebody who smokes is used to a 
8 certain type of reaction out of a level of THC, all 
9 of the sudden you see a spike in the quantity of it, 
10 what potentially could happen. Is it something that 
11 could be totally different? 
12 A Yes. See, what you are looking at is like 
13 a steady state so that using the drug on a regular 
14 basis. Then you get a massive dose, it jumps up and 
15 you can switch over into complete toxicity. Most of 
16 the drugs behave that way that you are stable and 
17 then it jumps up. 
18 Some drugs, like a couple of the 
19 amphetamines. You can take the same dose today, 
20 tomorrow, then you take it the next day and it's 
21 lethal. Those are the real dangerous drugs. 
22 Marijuana is not like that. So your point is well 
23 taken. You are stable and you have a massive dose 
24 you are going to get a big difference in the affects 
25 and could be completely different.

MS. WHIRLEY: Could this amount of THC 
3 that was found in the blood be, is it possible that 
4 someone who is ingesting that amount on a regular 
5 basis and not be dead? 
6 A Well, marijuana really isn't lethal. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
8 A So it couldn't kill him. As far as the 
9 affects, it would take a lot of marijuana on a 
10 regular basis to stay at this kind of level. So I 
11 would say that's less likely. 
12

Yes. 
Would a

24 mentioned a joint, but now we're talking about a 
25 cigar?

1 A Is that possible? Yes. See again, purity 
2 like low end purity is like 3 percent Delta-9, high 
3 end is like 20 percent. So that's a huge range, 
4 okay. Is it possible that the cigar got stuck with 
5 the higher end stuff? Yes, it is. 
6 You can reach this without 
7 waxing, I guess regular marijuana in the cigar? 
8 A I'm not sure, I'm not sure. I think it 
9 would be possible, but I'm not positive on that. 
10 I want to make 
11 sure I understand regarding larger person, you talk 
12 about the affects of --
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you speak up a little 
14 bit, sorry? 
15 I just wanted to make 
16 sure when you are talking about that, you are 
17 talking about the difference between the affects of 
18 a person who is larger versus the content in the 
19 blood. The affects would not be affected by the 
20 size of the person, but the content in the blood 
21 would be. 
22 A That is correct. It is a dose response. 
23 So it's like a smaller person takes less, a larger

1 question. When you smoke marijuana and 
2 he's talking about a blunt, through the cigar 
3 wrapper versus the cigarette papers, are you -- you 
4 are likely ingesting more of the marijuana when you 
5 are smoking it in a blunt versus the cigarette 
6 papers because they burn much quicker and smoke, 
7 would you agree or not? 
8 
9 
A Yeah, if it burns much quicker, yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Not that we are marijuana 
10 smokers, you know, but it appears if you watch it on 
11 TV, that the cigarette is burning much faster than 
12 when they smoke with a blunt. I think that's why a 
13 lot of people do the blunt? 
14 A Yes, because it is the dose and it's the 
15 destruction of the drug while you are not inhaling, 
16 yes. 
17 That raises a 
18 question. How is waxing taken into the body, is it 
19 smoked or is it, I mean, is it a waxy, sticky 
20 substance? 
21 A Yeah, it could be. It could be put in a 
22 blunt and smoked, it could be whatever as long as it 
23 gets into your body.

25 know, I think we can all understand that marijuana

1 can be eaten, it can be smoked, apparently it can be 
2 injected, the THC at least. Is there a difference 
3 in how quickly it would impair you or how quickly it 
4 would be in your system depending on how it is 
5 ingested. 
6 A Sure, oral is the worst. Anything that 
7 goes in your mouth goes to your stomach. It has a 
8 bunch of acids in there, it chews it up and then it 
9 goes to the liver. Once it is picked up by the 
10 blood, it goes into the liver. The liver chews it 
11 up as metabolism. So the oral would give you the 
12 least bang for the buck and probably take the 
13 longest because it has to be absorbed and 
14 metabolized and so son. 
15 When you inhale something it goes 
16 into your lungs, okay. And the heart blood goes 
17 from the right side to the lungs, to the left side 
18 and to the body, and goes to what is called the 
19 carotid arteries here in the aortic arch. So 
20 anything that goes in by inhalation gets up to the 
21 brain within like two, maybe three heartbeats. So 
22 it gets in and gives you a much quicker effect. 
23 Especially than oral. 
24 So just 
25 in your experience, we'll talk to others who have

1 more hands on with this specific, in your experience 
2 then would you assume that an autopsy or examination 
3 would show in the internal organs would be able to 
4 tell if something was smoked or ingested orally? 
5 A No, reasonably, no. Not unless there was 
6 something really unusual, like you are inhaling 
7 silica gel, or something like that. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Or perhaps if the stomach 
9 contents contained. 
10 A Leafy green material in the stomach 
11 contents. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Right. Any other 
13 questions? 
14 You said 
15 this THC stuff, if I heard you correctly, it binds 
16 with the fat cells; is that right? 
17 A Yeah, it does. 
18 Is that why you get hungry 
19 after you smoke a joint? Seriously, I'm just 
20 saying.

1 it is, reasonably that is lowering the blood sugar. 
2 So you start feeling hungry and get the munchies. 
3 MS. WHIRLEY: You said marijuana lowers 
4 the blood sugar? 
5 A That would be my, yes, that's what I 
6 believe. 
7 If it lowers 
8 the blood sugar, I had an uncle who is diabetic, 
9 when his blood sugar would be very low, he would 
10 get, I'm just going to say it he would get volatile, 
11 he would get agitated very easily. So would that be 
12 a possibility? 
13 A That would be a possibility, yes. If the 
14 blood sugar got down low enough, that would take, 
15 that would be work. 
16 And would the Delta-9-THC 
17 levels have an affect on the blood sugar level? 
18 A No. 
19 So the higher the 
20 Delta-THC would not necessarily constitute a lower 
21 blood sugar level? 
22 A Well, it would indicate that, yes, okay, 
23 but it hasn't been like so much THC and so much 
24 sugar, it hasn't done that.

1 to the readings of the 45 grams, and in your 
2 opinion, how well could Michael Brown function? 
3 A That's really tough to say just looking at 
4 the lab test. It is really tough to say. I know 
5 the drug was impairing the system, the exact parts 
6 of his nervous system that were impaired, how that 
7 would be demonstrated I can't predict. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
9 So you 
10 are saying he could experience some kind of 
11 impairment? 
12 A Yes, it would be impairment. 
13 Or he could be functioning 
14 normally? 
15 A No, not normal. The impairment would be 
16 present. The degree of the impairment would be 
17 based on him personally, his history with marijuana, 
18 his underlying chemistry, a whole bunch of other 
19 factors. So how it would exactly affect him is, I 
20 can't predict. I know it would have an affect 
21 because it is psychoactive. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: So a person could be 
23 impaired, because they have this in their system, 
24 but they could be sitting here talking and you might 
25 not even know they were impaired?

A That's correct. 
I have one

A Yes. 
Okay. Thank you. 
A That's just through the non specificity 
drug. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Again, when you talk about 
greater affect coming up, going from what 
13 talked about, that does not necessarily 
of 
14 mean that they are going to act impaired to someone 
15 who is sitting there talking to them? 
16 A No, I can't predict what they will or will 
17 not do.

Okay, thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: To tell you, I do not 
4 believe we have any kind of medical history or 
5 anything of that nature on him. 
6 Because my question would 
7 be, could some of the drugs be in his system versus 
8 when he was smoking it. Could that, you know --
9 A Well, it is possible some drugs could be 
10 present, but below detection, our cutoff limits. 
11 There is actually a theory that says you have your 
12 first, from your first spoon of baby food, the 
13 molecules are still floating around in your body, 
14 which is interesting. So there could be other drugs 
15 present at very low levels. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And just to be clear, THC 
17 is only found in marijuana, correct? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is not like we hear

1 about trace DNA. 
2 
3 
Q 
A 
Tell us what that means. 
Okay. Trace evidence is what is left 
Page 90 
4 behind when a material or a person made contact, so 
5 that can be footprints, fingerprints, soil samples, 
6 hair, fibers, or DNA. In our lab, what we refer to 
7 as a trace case, is something that the biologist 
8 doesn't actually examine, I don't actually test it, 
9 but I would save samples to be tested for DNA. 
10 Some examples of this are, urn, like a 
11 swab taken from the steering wheel of a recovered 
12 stolen vehicle where it isn't blood, you are trying 
13 to find out who stole the car, who was driving the 
14 car. 
15 It could be a shirt left behind from 
16 a robbery, so you would swab that for DNA, or a 
17 knife from a domestic assault. You wanted to know 
18 who was actually holding the knife, so you would 
19 swab it for user DNA. 
20 So those are the kind of things that 
21 we consider trace. Where it is not actually a body 
22 fluid that we are testing for, but we think that 
23 there might be DNA left behind. And usually what 
24 this is is from allele cells or skin cells.

1 someone actually collects what they think might be 
2 useful for the lab in determining whether there is 
3 DNA present, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Someone is swabbing and someone is doing 
6 that at the crime scene and then they submit it to 
7 you. Is there a certain way that that must be 
8 presented to you in order for it to be useful, for 
9 you to determine whether or not it has DNA or 
10 potentially --
11 A Well, I mean, we don't know because you 
12 can't see anything. So a lot of times the crime 
13 scene will swab things themselves and submit the 
14 actual swabs, or they will submit actual items like 
15 knives or shirts that I would then swab. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A Areas that I think would be useful areas 
18 to swab. 
19 Q Does the crime scene or the case officer 
20 tell you a little bit about the case for you to 
21 figure out what might be useful? 
22 A Yes. You do get a brief scenario of what 
23 happened. Like that gives you information about 
24 what is relevant or probative. For example, for a 
25 shirt, typically I would swab areas that would most

1 likely touch the skin. So like cuffs or the 
2 neckline, things like that. 
3 Q Can you tell us how you began a case, I 
4 mean, it comes to the lab, I guess, and then how do 
5 you get ahold of it? 
6 A When evidence is submitted to the lab, it 
7 is submitted to the front counter where evidence 
8 technicians take it in, make sure that it is 
9 properly packaged and sealed. We do not except 
10 improperly packaged evidence. 
11 So you would get evidence, either in 
12 a box or a package, it would also have a receipt 
13 with it. And the evidence receipt just details all 
14 of the pertinent information as when the incident 
15 happened, the location, what kind of offense it is, 
16 urn, who the victim is, who the suspect is, and then 
17 what actually is inside of the packages or boxes. 
18 So this evidence is then entered into 
19 our lab system, the actual evidence would be stored 
20 in our vaults, a secure location, until it is 
21 actually worked and the receipts would, they're 
22 stored back in biology and then we work them. It 
23 depends, but usually first end, first out. We do 
24 the crimes against persons cases first, they are 
25 more of a priority.

A 
Q 
Right. 
(Grand Jury Exhibit Number 68 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Whirley) I was going to ask you, 
18 let me move on to something else. What's marked as 
19 State's Exhibit Number 68, which is one of your 
20 crime lab reports, I think it is the first one. 
21 
22 
MS. ALIZADEH: Is Q22 the first one? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Actually, it is not the 
23 first one, it's the second one. This is the one 
24 with the baseball cap, Q22. Do you have that one? 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: You want me to pass this

1 along? 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: Why don't we pass both of 
3 them, if you don't mind, both Grand Jury Exhibit 68, 
4 which starts with specimen Q22. And then 69 is 
5 actually the first one I think you probably worked 
6 that starts with specimen Q1. You have both of 
7 those in front of you? 
A I do. 8 
9 Q (By Ms. Whirley) We are going to talk a 
10 little bit more specifically about the Michael Brown 
11 case or the Michael Brown shooting. You took some 
12 photographs also, is that right, associated with 
13 this case? 
14 A I did. 
15 Q We will look at those. And tell me why 
16 did you take photographs? 
17 A I can't, when I write my report, I can 
18 describe the items with words, but a picture is 
19 always better. 
20 Q Okay. All right. And you take those 
21 pictures for yourself as you are writing your 
22 report, is that what you told us? 
23 A What was that? 
24 Q You take those pictures for your purposes 
25 to complete your report?

A No, we are not required to take pictures. 
In specific cases we do take pictures. In this 
3 case, I decided to take pictures of certain items. 
4 Q Okay. Now, in this specific case, we see 
5 a Q and then numbers. Can you tell us what that 
6 represents? 
7 A A Q is, it just means a questioned item, 
8 so it is something that I am actually testing. 
9 Whereas later in the report you might see a K, and 
10 the K stands for a known, which is just a known 
11 reference standard taken from a person to be used 
12 for elimination or comparison purposes in DNA. And 
13 it is a known reference standard which means it came 
14 from that person in the forms of blood or saliva. 
15 Q So you know whose blood or saliva you 
16 have? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you had a known reference sample from 
19 Michael Brown; is that correct? 
A Yes. 
Q Is that in the form of blood? 
A His blood. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Okay. Did you have a known sample of the 
24 officer, Darren Wilson? 
25 A Yes.

Q Was that in the form of saliva? 
A Yes, it was a buccal swab. 
1 
2 
3 Q It is what you referred to as a buccal 
4 swab? 
5 A A buccal swab is a swab that is used to 
6 rub against the side of the mouth, against the 
7 cheek. So it takes, actually, where the DNA is 
8 coming from the cheek cells, but in the form of 
9 saliva. 
10 Q So that was your way of having a DNA 
11 sample from both the officer and Michael Brown; is 
12 that correct? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Now, you can see we all have a copy of 
15 your report dated, it was entered, it says 
16 8/11/2014, approved on 8/19/2014. What does 
17 administrative approval mean? 
18 A That is the signature of a person who 
19 tech-reviewed my report. What a tech review is, it 
20 is just kind of a double-check done by a peer in the 
21 same discipline to insure accuracy between the 
22 analyst notes and the report. 
23 Q Now Q1 through Q21 are items that you, I 
24 guess, that are questionable, is that what you said? 
25 A Yes.

5 Q 
Page 97 
Are these items that you took photographs 
I did not take photos of every single 
Okay. All right. Let's start to go 
6 through these. This tells us the items that you 
7 checked based on the information that you were told 
8 and the items that were brought to you; is that 
9 correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. So you did, just go ahead and 
12 tell us what you did. 
13 A Well, you are looking at the first report. 
14 I started with Michael Brown's clothing. So do you 
15 want me to go through Q1 or say everything I did? 
16 Q Tell us what you did. You can go through 
17 by Q1, whatever works for you, as long as you tell 
18 us, you know, what you did. 
19 A Sure. Q1 was Michael Brown's T-shirt, I 
20 just, we first do a visual examination so I would 
21 describe it, what it looked like. 
22 It had red brown stains, there were 
23 several holes in his shirt. I tested for blood. 
24 And then I also did a swabbing of the non blood 
25 stained areas for possible trace, since it was

1 alleged that there was contact between Officer 
2 Wilson and Michael Brown. 
3 It was hard to do this because the 
4 shirt was extremely bloody. So I just swabbed the 
5 areas that were not blood stained. 
6 Q You, of course, always wear gloves when 
7 you are handling any items; is that correct? 
8 A Yes, we wear personal protective 
9 equipment, which includes a lab coat, a mask, 
10 gloves, we use sterile equipment, we open one 
11 package of evidence at a time, we clean our work 
12 area. 
13 Q And these are things you do to prevent 
14 contamination or cross-contamination; is that 
15 correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Just to kind of, I guess, make it go a 
18 little faster since everyone has a copy of the 
19 report, all of these items you actually, did you 
20 test all of these items? 
21 A I have to go through 
22 Q Yeah, go ahead and look at it. 
23 A All of the clothing I tested, I tested for 
24 blood. As well as there was swabs taken from 
25 Michael Brown's hands, those were all tested for

1 blood as well. And then there were fingernail 
2 scrapings that were submitted, and I tested those 
3 and also swabbed those again for trace in case there 
4 was contact, such as scratching, things like that. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask you what did you 
6 swab for trace, the fingernail scrapings? 
7 A Yes. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So these fingernail 
9 scrapings were done by someone else, correct, like 
10 at the morgue? 
11 A Yeah. They labeled it fingernail 
12 scrapings, clippings, but they actually, I looked 
13 back, they were actually clippings. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Nail clippings. 
They take nail clippings. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That was forwarded to the 
18 lab, the nail clippings? 
19 A Yes. So what we do we swab the underside 
20 that you can tell for possible trace in case, again, 
21 there was contact. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. I didn't know 
23 if you were swabbing a swab when you talked about 
24 it.

1 Q (By Ms. Whirley) It looks like you 
2 swabbed, there was a swab collected and forwarded to 
3 you that represented the Brown's, the left back of 
4 his hands; is that correct? 
5 Yes. A 
6 And also the right palm, the right palm of Q 
7 
8 
9 
10 
hand? 
A Yes. 
Q And right back of hand? 
A Yes. Those were all tested for blood. 
11 And then there was a piece of, you have Q 
12 Q11, apparent skin or hardened nasal mucus? 
13 A Yes, when I, when I received it, all the 
14 information really said was something from the 
15 exterior of the door. And looking at it, I did 
16 ultimately know right away what it was. So I called 
17 it apparent skin, or harden nasal mucus, because I 
18 wasn't sure. It was very small. I took a picture 
19 of it. 
20 Q Okay. We'll look at those pictures. And 
21 you were told, or it was on the evidence receipt, 
22 where these items came from? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q Like from the front exterior door of the 
25 Ferguson Police Department Vehicle 108 for that one?

A 
Q 
Page 101 
Yes. 
Then there's also a swab of the rear 
3 passenger exterior door of that same vehicle, which 
4 is Q12? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And then blood stains from the 
7 area on Canfield. And then Q15, actually, the other 
8 items that I talk about when I mention swabs taken 
9 from Brown's hands, it says suspect Brown, and now 
10 on Q15 it says victim's uniform pants, and that is 
11 the officer; is that correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
The officer's uniform pants when you label 
14 as suspect and victim, what does that mean for you? 
15 A When we receive the evidence receipts that 
16 come with the evidence, they are, each case is 
17 assigned a victim or a suspect. I don't declare 
18 this, it was what was already like that when it came 
19 to the lab. 
20 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
Q 
From the police? 
Right. 
So it is not that you are determining who 
23 the victim is or who is the suspect is in this case? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No. 
So you have the officer's uniform pants

1 and you swab the left thigh, why did you do that? 
2 A Well, those swabs were actually taken by 
3 crime scene. 
4 Q I'm sorry, that's true, you didn't swab, 
5 they swabbed it. And did you have any information 
6 about why that was swabbed or you just tested it? 
7 A Well, all I knew was that there was 
8 possible blood on the officer's pants. So they did 
9 swab that to find out whose blood that was. 
10 Q Okay. And then there was swabs from the 
11 interior left front door of vehicle number 108, 
12 which is Q18? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Okay. And then you also received swabs of 
15 the officer's weapon; is that correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Now, in Q19, which is the weapon, it says 
18 blood was presumptively detected. Quantity was not 
19 sufficient for confirmatory testing. What does that 
20 mean? 
21 A Well, I was able to do a presumptive test 
22 for blood, which is just the first step in our 
23 process of testing blood. Presumptive test, it is a 
24 sensitive test, but it is not specific. So it 
25 indicates that the substance you are testing for is

1 possibly there. In this case, blood, so that was 
2 positive. 
3 To do a confirmatory test, you need 
4 to actually take more of that sample. Since there 
5 wasn't that much to begin with, I didn't want to use 
6 any more of a sample since there wasn't that much, 
7 it would have to go to DNA. 
8 So rather than, I guess, use up any 
9 more of a sample, I just indicated that confirmatory 
10 testing was impossible, but blood was presumptively 
11 detected. 
12 Q So in this case the DNA section could test 
13 further? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And you do say that the swabs were 
16 retained. You also tested Q20, is Wilson's blue 
17 uniform shirt, a swab was submitted? 
A No, I actually swabbed. 18 
19 Q You swabbed it, okay. So you swabbed the 
20 left side of his shirt and collar area. So you 
21 just, the whole shirt was submitted and you 
22 determined what to swab? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q Okay. And the uniform pants, is that the 
25 same thing in Q21 with the swabbing?

1 A I did do the swabbing. And since there 
2 was, there was a blood stain on the pants. So when 
3 I was swabbing for trace, I avoided that stain. 
4 Q Okay. And now if we look at the other 
5 report, which is Grand Jury Exhibit 68, Q22 through 
6 Q26. Now, this report looks like it is done on a 
7 different day, or is entered on a different day, and 
8 it is also, I imagine, tested on a different day; is 
9 that correct?

working a 
know why it wasn't all given to you 
And typically this happens when 
case right away, right after it 
15 happens. Sometimes all the evidence doesn't come in 
16 at the same time. So in this case, I worked all 
17 that I had on the first date and then we received 
18 more to be tested. So I did that work on a later 
19 date, like a week later. I work part-time. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
So everything would have been done on a

2 that kind of first-come first-serve, or something to 
3 that effect, generally as you work cases. Was this 
4 case given a priority? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
It was. 
Because of the significance? 
The significance and the sensitivity of 
8 the nature of the case. 
9 Q Okay. So there was a baseball cap, Q22, 
10 that a swabbing, it says, so you swabbed the 
11 baseball cap? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And then the flip flop, a separate 
14 swabbing was retained for trace. Did you do 
15 something with the flip flop in Q23? 
16 A Yes, there were some reddish brown stains, 
17 so I tested those for blood, but then I also tested 
18 for trace, or as I mentioned before, kind of a wear 
19 profile to identify whose they were. 
20 Q And then it looks like you did in Q24, 
21 that was another flip flop, and in Q25 is the 
22 bracelet?

15 already told us about this one. But again, what are 
16 we looking at now that everybody can see it. 
17 A That is what, again, because I didn't know 
18 exactly what it was at the time, but that was what I 
19 called apparent skin, or hardened nasal mucus, from 
20 outside of the car on the door.

1 A 99 represents County. 
2 Q Their municipal code? 
3 A Their municipal codes to, like Ballwin is

5 is considered County, which is 99. 14 is the year, 
6 and the 43984 is just the actual number that was

6 A The shirt, yes. This is -- I swabbed the 
7 left side of the shirt, the collar, the shirt area, 
8 for trace. Again, the alleged contacted between

18 items, correct? When I say the old days, might have 
19 been before your time. 
20 
21 
A We did. You can do either. 
MS. ALIZADEH: In this case you didn't 
22 take cuttings? 
23 A Right. You can get, you could cover a 
24 larger area surface area. If I'm actually taking a 
25 swab to get the most possible DNA with trace cases

1 with trace evidence, there is not going to be as 
2 much DNA left behind as if someone is bleeding. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
4 A So to try to maximize that rather than 
5 take a cutting of a small area. Plus, you don't 
6 know where, you know, where there was contact. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Correct. And in this case, 
8 when you visually examine this shirt, did you see 
9 anything that looked like apparent blood? 
10 
11 
A No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And had you seen something 
12 that looked like apparent blood, would you have 
13 actually swabbed that spot? 
14 A Yes. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: But in this case, because 
16 you didn't see anything, you just kind of doing a 
17 broad brush on the shirt? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And that's cause you have 
20 had information from a case officer that perhaps 
21 Michael Brown touched the shirt of the officer on 
22 the left side? 
23 A Yes.

MS. ALIZADEH: The shirts repackaged? 
The shirt was, yes, kept in. Would have 
5 been finished, completed and sent to property

Yes. 
(By Ms. Whirley) And repackage? 
The actual clothing items, they weren't 
13 sent to DNA. It would be either cuttings that I 
14 took or swabbings that I took, that would go to DNA. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And to be clear on this 
16 shirt, you swabbed two areas, the collar area; is 
17 that correct? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: When you say the collar 
20 area because this collar goes all away the around 
21 the shirt, was it what area?

23 side. Nothing around the back. So I think in the 
24 other picture is better.

1 identified that as 28. So you can see the shirt, 
2 there's a laser pen right in front of you, laser 
3 pointer. Can you show the jurors when you talk 
4 about swabbing the collar, where did you swab? 
5 A So, I would have swabbed or I did swab 
6 this area right here, just the front. And then the 
7 left side of the shirt, all right here.

MS. ALIZADEH: Including the sleeve? 
Including the sleeve, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So when you swabbed that 
11 left side, the whole left side of the shirt pretty 
12 much, did you just use one swab or did you take 
13 several swabs of that area? 
14 A I think I took two. Usually something in 
15 that area, that big I would have taken two, two 
16 swabs. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Both of those were 
18 forwarded to DNA? 
19 
20 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And then for the collar, 
21 did you do one or two, do you recall? 
22 A It was two swabs for the entire area. 
23 They weren't separated. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: So you didn't swab the 
25 collar and the left side separately?

MS. WHIRLEY: Can you see it okay? 
Yeah, I can see it. I swabbed, again, 
3 take two swabs, swabbed this area. There was an 
4 area, I think it was in this location. This picture 
5 isn't perfect to see the blood stain, but I did not 
6 swab that area because swabbing that area you would 
7 get blood of whoever at the time. I didn't know 
8 whose it was. So for trace, since I'm trying to 
9 find if there was contact, so swabbed any of the non 
10 blood stained areas. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So there was blood stain 
12 on the pants? 
13 A Yes. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And you tested that for 
15 blood?

The back of the shirt. 
Now, you mention swabbing non stained 
For possible trace. 
For possible trace. Why would you not 
9 swab the blood stain areas for trace? 
10 A Well, blood is -- contains a lot of DNA. 
11 And then also it was Michael Brown's shirt, which 
12 would have DNA from him wearing it too. So for me 
13 to try to swab bloody areas, it is just unlikely to 
14 actually get a trace profile from that because the 
15 blood would overwhelm everything. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have a question? 
17 I know 
18 you may not have known this, but I don't know at the 
19 time if Michael Brown was supposedly been in the

4 A Yes, uh-huh. In case, if there was,

6 Okay. 
7 A It was hard in this instant. The shirt 
8 was blood soaked. So I did, again, do the same 
9 thing for trace DNA. I took two swabs and just 
10 swabbed the non stained areas. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) This is the back of the

9 
10 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You are not going underarm 
11 here and the tail of shirt from another spot? 
12 A No. And again, for a trace, we are trying 
13 to collect as much DNA as possible. So by keeping 
14 it to two swabs, rather than separating it. If 
15 there was something to collect, would be more likely 
16 to collect it with less swabs than large quantity. 
17 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. And this one,

2 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I just go back really 
3 quickly. 
4 The apparent skin, or hardened nasal mucus 
5 that you looked at, did you swab that and forward 
6 the swabs to the DNA section, or did you forward the 
7 whole piece you said of whatever it was. 
8 A The whole piece did go, but I took a 
9 cutting of it. What we do with either the swabs in 
10 this case, that little piece, I would have sampled a 
11 section and put it in a tube and that's what DNA 
12 would actually test. And the remainder of that 
13 section I took approximately 4 millimeters by 3 
14 millimeters, and that's what actually the DNA unit 
15 would actually test. 
16 The rest of that, the remainder also 
17 went to DNA in case they need to do further testing. 
18 Same thing would happen with the 
19 swab. Like those two swabs that I took for trace, I 
20 sampled half of each swab, put that in a tube and 
21 that's what DNA you would be testing. And then the 
22 remainder of those swabs would be put in a container 
23 and they would be transported together. Does that 
24 make sense?

1 apparent skin or hardened nasal mucus, did you do 
2 any testing on that yourself other than to take a 
3 swab, take the piece out of it? 
4 A I tested it for blood, and then I did a 
5 test to confirm blood and determine probable 
6 species. What that means, this test is called 
7 Hemastix. What it does is that if it's positive, it 
8 confirms that it is blood and it is also presumptive 
9 for human species. And the reason why we can't say, 
10 oh, it is human blood for sure is that there are 
11 some other primates and ferrets blood that will --
12 
13 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Ferrets? 
Ferrets, yeah. I don't know why. That 
14 have reported given positive results. So in that 
15 case, the way we report it on my report is that for 
16 Q11, that examination discloses presence of blood as 
17 probably human organ.

11 swabbed areas that would touch skin. If you're 
12 wearing it on the hat, it is the inner rim of the 
13 hat of the bill. 
14 Q This is number 38, also a photograph of

18 
19 
20 
21 
Q All right. And then Number 39. So you 
also took photographs of the flip flops that you 
were told he was wearing; is that right? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And that's 39 and 40, which I will show in 
24 a moment. Did you do anything with that spot that's 
25 there that we're looking at?

MS. WHIRLEY: We had an interruption for 
3 the alarm sounding. We are good now. So we were on 
4 Number 39, Photograph Number 39 and Number 40, which 
5 we will show in a minute. They are both pictures of 
6 the flip flops that you were told Michael Brown was 
7 wearing, correct? Tell us was there anything of 
8 evidentiary value that was lifted from those flip 
9 flops? 
10 A Well, I tested orange brown stain for 
11 possible blood. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Is that what we are looking at here? 
For Q23, I tested reddish brown stain on 
14 the outside left side, so yes. 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
(By Ms. Whirley) Everybody see that stain? 
And then I also, let me see. I also 
17 swabbed the top of the sole area and the under side 
18 of the strap, the white strap, for trace for who was 
19 wearing. Again, like the hat, I didn't know who it 
20 belonged to. 
21 Q Okay. And this is Number 40. We see a 
22 little speck on 40 too, did you test that also? 
23 A I did. I tested, my notes one of four 
24 small reddish brown stains. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And did you confirm it to be blood?

1 A The quantity was not sufficient so I 
2 didn't confirm it. And then I also, like the other 
3 flip flop I swabbed, I will show you, I swabbed the 
4 sole area and then underneath the strap for trace. 
5 Q And this is 41. This was submitted to 
6 you, correct?

A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What did you do with this? 
Again, there was no one code as to who it 
10 belonged to. To get a wear DNA, I just swabbed the 
11 entire bracelet for trace DNA. 
12 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
So that's a bracelet? 
Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And just to be clear 
15 because we have two bracelets, this is the bracelet 
16 that is rubber with yellow, white and black 
17 coloring?

4 MS. WHIRLEY: We'll talk to the DNA person 
5 to see if anything of evidentiary value came from 
6 the swabbing because you really can't talk about 
7 that, correct?

1 you tell me of the items, of the items you tested, 
2 you found apparent blood on the officer's pant leg, 
3 correct? Did you test that stain on the officer's 
4 pant leg? 
5 A I tested the swabs, I didn't doubly test 
6 it, so I tested the swabs that came from the crime 
7 scene from the pant. 
8 Q 
9 blood? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Okay. And did you determine that was 
Yes, they were blood. 
And you didn't see any apparent blood on 
12 the shirt of the officer, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q And then, you know, we've talked about the 
15 shirt of Michael Brown, the pant and the socks all 
16 had apparent blood on them, correct? 
17 A Or confirmed blood, yes. 
18 Q Or confirmed. I'm mixing my terms. 
19 Apparent is when you're not you sure what it is, but 
20 it looks like it? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And then on the sandals, you didn't have 
23 enough to confirm that it was blood; is that right? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes. 
And then what about the swab from the gun,

1 there were two swabs submitted from the gun. Did 
2 you test those swabs? 
3 A I tested that for blood. Yes, the swabs, 
4 they were, they had reddish brown stains and black 
5 stains on the swab. Since it had a reddish brown 
6 stain, I tested it for blood. It was presumptively 
7 positive for blood, but the quantity was not 
8 sufficient for confirmatory testing. Again, I 
9 didn't want to

Q 
A 
Q

Q 
Destroy the sample? 
Yes. 
Consume the sample? 
Yes. 
That was presumptive positive for blood, 
15 but you didn't do a confirmatory test and you 
16 forwarded that to the DNA section, would that be 
17 right? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then what about the swabs from the 
20 interior of the door of the police vehicle, did you 
21 test those swabs? 
22 A I tested, well, there were, there were 
23 several. So you're saying that interior, I received 
24 numerous swabs from the car. Do you mean in 
25 general, or you want me to go through each one?

Q Well, I'm thinking in particular there 
were photographs that were taken by that 
3 there was reddish brown stain on the driver's side, 
4 on the driver's door, on the inside of the door? 
5 A Okay. So what I have is Q12 was a swab 
6 with reddish brown stains from the driver rear 
7 passenger exterior door.

Yes. 
Let's go back. You talked about the swab 
20 that you received that was from the exterior rear 
21 driver's door. 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And I recall we had a photograph that was 
24 taken by that had a reddish brown spatter

1 that is the swab that you tested, what did you 
2 determine about that? 
3 A I determined that it was blood of probable 
4 human origin. 
5 Q Is that a presumptive test or is that a 
6 confirmatory test? 
7 A It is confirmatory for blood, but it is 
8 presumptive for the species just because there has 
9 been reporting of some upper primates and ferrets 
10 producing the same result. So we say probable human 
11 origin for that. 
12 And since it was on the exterior of 
13 the car, that's why I wanted to do that to test or 
14 give a possible species result just because it was 
15 outside the car. 
16 Q So it is conclusive for blood on the 
17 outside of the door, conclusive for the blood on the 
18 inside of the door, conclusive or presumptive for 
19 blood on the gun? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes.

1 already testified about that. 
2 Did you do any blood, did you test 
3 for blood on the apparent skin or hardened nasal 
4 mucus? I know you said you took a sample from that 
5 to forward to the DNA section, did you test it for 
6 blood? 
7 A I did. I confirmed it for blood and also 
8 for presumptive species for that was positive.

A 
Q 
And that was on the outside of the car as 
Yes.

14 the DNA section, correct? 
15 A Not every item, but the probative items I 
16 confirmed blood on, such as Michael Brown's 
17 clothing, those samples weren't forwarded. I can go 
18 through each of the items that I did forward, I have 
19 a sheet. 
20 Q Well, if I asked you the skin/nasal mucus, 
21 that actually a sample got forwarded to the DNA 
22 section, correct? 
23 A Yes.

14 you forwarded those swabs to the DNA section, 
15 correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And then you've already testified about

20 section, correct?

6 When you 
7 get through swabbing, does it automatically go 
8 directly to the DNA or someone comes behind you, is 
9 there another step between you and the DNA testing? 
10 A No. Once I would do any testing that I 
11 need to do, then I also sample it and prepare the 
12 sample for DNA, and then it will be put into a 
13 refrigerator until the DNA analyst takes it.

14 A Sure. Generally evidence is collected 
15 from a scene or from a hospital or from other 
16 medical examiner's office, et cetera. That evidence 
17 is submitted to the laboratory and a biologist or 
18 biological screener obtains that evidence from the 
19 vault, they process it for whatever bodily fluids or 
20 potential DNA may be there. 
21 They perform their testing and they

Q All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You might be able to 
3 advance by doing that. 
Page 145 
4 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Tell us that first slide. 
5 That first slide, DNA processing, talk to us about 
6 it and then indicate to Kathi when she should go to 
7 the next slide. 
8 A Sure. So if at any point you all have 
9 questions, feel free to interrupt me. If I start 
10 talking too fast or anything. 
11 So this first slide is giving a 
12 little bit of background information on what 
13 forensic DNA testing is and the type we perform in 
14 our laboratory. We do what is called nuclear DNA 
15 testing. That just means that we're looking at DNA 
16 that's in the nucleus of a cell. 
17 So if you think of an egg, would be 
18 like the egg yoke. That's where the nucleus is. 
19 And more specifically the technology 
20 that we use is called short tandem repeat or STR. 
21 Basically the thing to take away is that we are not 
22 sequencing genomes here, we are not able to 
23 determine if there's genetic diseases or any sort of 
24 information like that. 
25 We're actually looking at areas of

1 the DNA that are, what we call junk DNA. So they're 
2 just sequences that are scattered throughout the 
3 genome that differ from person to person, but they 
4 don't have any known function, so they are not 
5 genes. 
6 Q All right. So next slide? 
7 A So here is a little graphic of DNA. It is 
8 basically a chemical blueprint of your body. We get 
9 half of our DNA from our mother and half from our 
10 father. It varies from person to person and it is 
11 found in almost all cells in the human body. So 
12 again, I mention the nucleus. Any cell that has a 
13 nucleus is going to contain nuclear DNA. Next. 
14 This is just a little slide on what 
15 exactly I mean by short tandem repeat. Essentially, 
16 you have a little segment that is usually by four 
17 base pairs long that repeats over and over again. 
18 And so in forensics, what we do is actually 
19 determine how many times that little unit repeats. 
20 So you can see here there is an 
21 illustration of that. You can see there is seven 
22 repeats there on the top and eight on the bottom. 
23 I also mentioned that we get half of 
24 our DNA from our mother and half from our father. 
25 So for all of your chromosomes you basically have a 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video

Page 147 
1 pair of each chromosome, so one from mom and one 
2 from dad. So in this illustration, perhaps the 
3 seven repeats came from mom and the eight repeats 
4 came from dad. So that's essentially what STR 
5 technology is. 
6 The way that we're able to actually 
7 obtain the DNA profile is something called 
8 polymerase chain reaction, basically it is just a 
9 fancy word for copying for amplification. We are 
10 able to target specific areas on the DNA and amplify 
11 millions of copies of those so that it can be 
12 detected by an instrument. So again, we are not 
13 sequencing genomes, we are just looking at very 
14 specific points on the DNA. 
15 Just another thing that's important 
16 to note. I know on CSI and shows like that they 
17 sort of just get a profile and they magically know 
18 who it is, but in reality it is just like 
19 fingerprints where you have to have reference DNA 
20 from an individual to obtain what their profile is 
21 to compare it to the case. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So when you say 
23 reference, you are talking about some known sample? 
24 A Yes. 
25 Q So if you take my blood or my buccal swab

1 and you are comparing it, I'm the reference sample?

Q

6 copying. 
7 A 
8 Q 
That's correct. 
Not just some unknown entity out there? 
Right. 
And then when you talked about the 
Yes. 
Is that what allows you to get a DNA 
9 sample from something as minute as a little blood 
10 stain? 
11 A That's correct, yes. With older 
12 technologies like RFLP that's mentioned on the 
13 slide, you needed a blood stain about the size of a 
14 quarter. Whereas now with PCR you can get DNA 
15 profile from a tiny speck of blood or even 
16 potentially skin cells left behind from someone 
17 grasping an object. 
18 Q So sometimes when the police aren't able 
19 to get a fingerprint sample, they may, latent print, 
20 you may be able to find with DNA?

Okay.

1 A And it is also important to note at all 
2 stages we have controls that are run along with the 
3 samples, both positive and negative controls, just 
4 to make sure that all the reagents are free of 
5 contamination and that the analyst isn't introducing 
6 any contamination. 
7 Q That raises another question. What do you 
8 do to make sure your own DNA isn't getting into 
9 sloughing or flaking off into things that you are 
10 testing? 
11 A Yes, there is couple things that we do. 
12 We wear protective equipment, so lab coats, masks, 
13 gloves, we change gloves in between samples, we use 
14 all of the consumables, et cetera, are one-time use. 
15 We don't reuse any of the plastics. 
16 The second thing is we actually have 
17 all of our DNA profiles in a local database. So 
18 every sample that we run, we crosscheck it against 
19 all of the individuals in the laboratory to insure 
20 that we are not being detected in the sample. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question. Talking 
22 about the copying or amplification, I know in some 
23 cases I've had where the report will say that there 
24 wasn't a sufficient amount of DNA to obtain a 
25 profile. Why can't you just, can't you just copy it 
FAX 314-241-6750

Page 150 
1 over and over again until you can get a big enough 
2 thing to test? 
3 A Yes. So when you see that sometimes in 
4 our record, we do actually amplify all samples, even 
5 if the, well, I guess there's a step before it 
6 called quantitation, where we estimate how much DNA 
7 is there. Some labs stop at the quantitation step, 
8 if there is no DNA indicated in the samples. We go 
9 ahead and carry it through and amplify everything. 
10 So when that sentence appears in the 
11 report, it just indicates that basically the result 
12 that we got, there was just not information there to 
13 do a comparison. We weren't able to amplify enough 
14 to get a result. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Is it possible that you 
16 wouldn't have any DNA in that sample? 
17 A It is possible, yes. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So when you say you amplify 
19 it, it undergoes a process whether you know there's 
20 DNA there or not? 
21 A 
22 samples. 
23 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. We go ahead and amplify all the 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
Yes. I think that's all for this slide. 
And so this is sort of a little bit 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video

Grand Jury Volume XIX November 4, 2014

1 technical here. This just goes through the various 
2 steps. You can see the first step shows a biologist 
3 with an alternate light source. Typically that's 
4 used to look for semen or potentially saliva stains. 
5 We don't usually use this to look for blood. You 
6 probably see that on CSI though. 
7 So after the biologist prepares 
8 everything, the next step in DNA is called 
9 extraction. Basically all that's doing is purifying 
10 the DNA. The cells have a lot of proteins and other 
11 debris that we're not interested in. So the 
12 extraction part gives us a clean DNA sample. 
13 Quantitation is the next step. I 
14 just mentioned that a minute ago. Again, we are 
15 trying to estimate how much DNA is there. This is 
16 important because we have a target range that we're 
17 trying to get to. We have a target number of copies 
18 we want to get to. 
19 If we have, for example, a blood 
20 stain that has a lot of DNA in it, we might, 
21 basically, we need to use less of that to get to 
22 that target amount. Whereas if we have a swab of a 
23 steering wheel where maybe there is just skin cells, 
24 we probably need to amp a little bit more of that. 
25 So that step just lets us know how much to load into

1 our amplification. 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) What is this target, did 
3 you say target number? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Where does that come from? 
6 A Typically it is based on validation 
7 studies. There is something called developmental 
8 validation and then there's also internal 
9 validation. So internal validation is what I'm 
10 responsible for, any time we're bringing in new 
11 technology online. That number is determined during 
12 that process. 
13 Q Is this part of the accreditation that you 
14 determined, I mean, who determines what the number 
15 should be is I guess what I'm trying to figure out? 
16 A In our case, it would be me, since I'm the 
17 one performing the validation. So I look at data 
18 that's available in the community from the 
19 developmental validation, which is typically done by 
20 the manufacturer. And then we do additional testing 
21 to make sure that it works in our hands just like it 
22 does in the manufacturer's laboratory. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So you can see pictures of the instruments 
25 there. Number 4, the yellow, that's the thermal

1 cycler. And that's what does the copying. 
2 Basically it is just a heat clock, it heats and 
3 cools the sample for certain amount of time and 
4 certain temperatures. And it allows the DNA to be 
5 copied. 
6 And then the last step, the green, 
7 that's called the CE, capillary electrophoresis. 
8 Basically it's just a fancy term for the instrument 
9 that actually gives us the DNA profile. So it's 
10 able to separate out those copy fragments by size. 
11 And then also during the copying step 
12 there were fluorescent tags that were added. So 
13 that's what the instrument is actually seeing are 
14 those fluorescent tags. So it is able to give us a 
15 DNA profile tag. 
16 This is what a profile actually looks 
17 like. You can see there is green boxes above the 
18 peaks. Basically that is just the name of the 
19 location on the DNA that we're looking at. It is 
20 too small to read, but let's say D3, for example, 
21 that just means it is on the third chromosome. 
22 The other thing to note here, there 
23 is either one or two peaks under each of those 
24 spots. And that just goes back to what I was 
25 mentioning earlier about you getting half of your

1 DNA from your mother and half from your father. 
2 So that is how we are able to do 
3 paternity testing as well. If you have reference 
4 standards from the parents and the children, you can 
5 look location by location to see if those parents 
6 contributed the DNA to the child. 
7 Q At the bottom it says every person has a 
8 unique DNA profile except for identical twins? 
9 A That's correct, yes. Everyone on earth 
10 has unique forensic DNA profile except for identical 
11 twins. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And then the numbers under each peak, 
14 that's just how many times it's repeating. Some of 
15 them say 15, 16, that's what we call the genome 
16 type, that set of numbers, and that is what we 
17 compare to the reference standards. 
18 This is just a slide on touch DNA. I 
19 mentioned it briefly earlier. Touch DNA is also 
20 called trace DNA. Essentially, that's just when we 
21 are trying to obtain DNA left behind by contact with 
22 an object. 
23 So a steering wheel swab, for 
24 example, the handle of a knife, let's stay that was 
25 used in an assault, swab of sunglasses, earrings,

1 there is all sorts of things that we can attempt to 
2 get touch DNA on. 
3 There is a lot of factors that go 
4 into whether or not we can actually get a profile 
5 from that. The length of time that the contact was 
6 actually made can be a determining factor. The 
7 biology of the individual. Some people shed a lot 
8 of DNA, some people don't, and there is no way to 
9 predict that. 
10 If the individual is sweating and 
11 really worked up, then they are more likely to leave 
12 larger amounts of DNA behind. And also the surface 
13 of the item that's being contacted, so typically it 
14 is kind of like the opposite of a fingerprint. This 
15 might be a smooth surface, it might be great for 
16 fingerprints, but not as good for DNA. And that's 
17 really just a twofold thing. 
18 Essentially, when you have something 
19 like fabric, there is more friction that's going to 
20 be pulling cells off. And then there's also more 
21 places for the cells to kind of cling to and 
22 maintain and stay in there. 
23 Q With the touch DNA, someone's DNA profile 
24 may be on an item, but can you say whether it is 
25 saliva, skin cells, I mean, can you speak exactly to

1 what that bodily item is or not? 
2 A No. Forensic DNA profile is going to be 
3 the same throughout your body. So whether it's from 
4 blood or semen or skin cells, the DNA profile that I 
5 showed you a minute ago is going to look exactly the 
6 same. 
7 So screening test can kind of, I 
8 guess, illustrate, or maybe point to a probable 
9 source of the DNA, but the DNA profile itself will 
10 not indicate that.

You can say this is the profile?

But you can't say what the actual bodily 
Correct. 
Okay. 
We'll have to kind of press through these. 
These are just like pictures for us? 
These are just some limitations, we just 
20 talked about one, but DNA, again, that profile is 
21 not going to tell us when it was deposited. The 
22 next one. 
23 
24 question. 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let me back up, I have a 
Sure.

Page 157 
MS. ALIZADEH: And it probably is not 
2 particularly relevant in this case. The DNA 
3 degrades, so like you said, you can't tell when it 
4 was deposited, you know, we see on TV where they 
5 will dig up, exhume a body that's been buried for 
6 100 years they will do DNA on it. Is there any way 
7 to tell if the DNA is recent or fresh DNA, as 
8 opposed to something that's been degrading over 
9 time? 
10 A Well, there's certain things in the 
11 profile where you can tell if the sample has been 
12 degraded, but there is nothing to indicate 
13 specifically how long something has been degrading 
14 for or how long it has been in the ground or 
15 anything to that effect. 
16 Domestic incidents. So let's say, 
17 for example, husband and wife living together, wife 
18 stabs husband with a steak knife. Let's say we find 
19 her DNA on the handle, that's great, but since she 
20 lives in the house and handles the knife all the 
21 time, maybe she just ate a steak the hour before. 
22 So DNA is less useful in situations like that. 
23 Intent. So this typically has to do 
24 with sexual assault cases. Again, DNA profile is 
25 not going to tell us whether the sex was consensual

1 or whether it was a rape. We simply obtain a 
2 profile or we don't, that's all. 
3 We just talked about this a little 
4 bit. We can't determine what fluid the DNA profile 
5 is from definitively. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You use the word fluid, you 
7 can get DNA from skin cells, correct? 
8 A Correct. And then as we mentioned 
9 earlier, identical twins will have the same profile. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: What are those little 
11 things in the middle there? 
12 A Those are angry sperm. That has to do 
13 with the consensual sex or not. I always say it 
14 would be great if they looked like that under the 
15 microscope, but they don't. 
16 And then as Kathi just touched on, 
17 DNA can be degraded by environmental conditions, 
18 chemicals, like bleach. 
19 So in this case there was some DNA 
20 mixture obtained. I just wanted to touch briefly on 
21 what that is exactly. You can go ahead and hit the 
22 forward. 
23 Mixture is just where we have DNA 
24 from more than one individual on an item. Sometimes 
25 we have so many people on an item that we are not

Page 159 
1 able to discern any particular profile and we're not 
2 able to make any useful comparisons or inclusions. 
3 And then other times we have cases 
4 where maybe there's a large amount of DNA from one 
5 contributor, but the other people on the sample are 
6 not contributing very much. So we might be able to 
7 get a great result for the person who is donating a 
8 lot of DNA, but the minor contributors, as we call 
9 it, might be inconclusive because there is not 
10 enough there. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) If the minor person or 
12 the minor profile is too little to tell, you know, 
13 it is not a full profile, do you include or make any 
14 determinations whether or not that person can be 
15 included or excluded? 
16 A So it depends on, well, let me back up. 
17 The first thing that we do is when we get the DNA 
18 profile back, we actually perform our interpretation 
19 prior to looking at any reference standards. So we 
20 go location by location and look to see is the 
21 profile complete enough to be a comparison. And if 
22 so, what locations do we feel fully represent the 
23 DNA samples, so which location are conclusive. 
24 So after marking all of that out and 
25 making all of our interpretations, then we go and do 
FAX 314-241-6750

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Page 160 
1 the comparison. 
2 So if we ran into a situation where 
3 a, let's say there's a minor contributor, but there 
4 is just not a lot of DNA from them, but the peaks 
5 that are there perhaps are consistent with a 
6 reference standard that we are looking at. Again, 
7 if the data is not of sufficient quality, then we 
8 would say it is inconclusive and we can't determine 
9 if they're there or not. 
10 If those peaks simply don't match 
11 that person, then we would do what's called an 
12 exclusion, and we would indicate that they're 
13 excluded from that sample. 
14 You know 
15 when we are born and take our footprints and 
16 fingerprints, do you ever have to go like back to 
17 the hospital and look up birth records or anything 
18 like that sometimes to determine? 
19 A No, we actually don't have access to that 
20 kind of materials. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question. 
22 of course, testified before you about areas of a 
23 shirt that she swabbed and chose not to swab for 
24 trace DNA. And she testified about the bloody areas 
25 on a shirt and that she didn't swab those areas for 
FAX 314-241-6750

Page 161 
1 trace DNA. She said something about the DNA section 
2 from the blood would overwhelm the trace. So can 
3 you explain what that means? 
4 A Yes, so that exactly what we're talking 
5 about we are talking about here. If here's a huge 
6 amount of DNA from one person, essentially, that's 
7 going to do what we call preferential amplification. 
8 It just means that's going to be copied much more 
9 than the person that left the tiny bit of DNA. 
10 So if there is not enough there, it 
11 is not going to amplify up, so we might not be able 
12 to make a conclusive determination about that 
13 person. 
14 So I know we all have post-lunch food 
15 coma, but it is getting a little technical here, but 
16 this is just an illustration or what it actually 
17 looks like when we say major contributor. 
18 So you can see there is numbers, 10, 
19 11, 13, 16, 17, et cetera, you can see how some of 
20 those peaks are very distinctly higher above the 
21 rest of the peaks. So that's what we are talking 
22 about when we say major contributor. So the 10 and 
23 the 16 in the first location, the 11, 13, 17, those 
24 would be what we call minor contributor. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: And you mean those little

1 tiny peaks. 
2 A Yeah, those little tiny down at the 
3 bottom, correct. So, again, typically our 
4 separation is about four to one, that's where we 
5 would determine there is a major contributor. So 
6 when those peaks are four times higher than the 
7 people down in the graph. 
8 And then we can also have a major 
9 mixture where there is two people that are 
10 contributing a lot of DNA and then there might be 
11 just a couple tiny trace peaks from another 
12 individual. 
13 So everywhere you see the red M in 
14 those boxes, that's what is being called the major 
15 mixture. So the majority of the DNA is being 
16 contributed by those two individuals. 
17 So we can sort of treat that like a 
18 separate mixture from the stuff that's down in the 
19 graph. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: And I recall from your 
21 report, which I know we haven't passed out yet, 
22 there is places where you talk about a mixture of at 
23 least two people or a mixture of, so is it possible 
24 then when you say that it could be a mixture of more 
25 than two people?

3 is six people? 
4 
5 
6 
A 
A 
Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
Yes, in that scenario the report wording 
7 will say, there was a major mixture component of two 
8 individuals detected and then it will say an 
9 additional allele indicated a possible trace 
10 contributor or something to that effect. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So when it says that, 
12 that means that there is another profile there, but 
13 you just don't have enough? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. From the trace individual, yes. 
Okay. 
When we do our comparison and we find a 
17 probative match, probative just means something 
18 that's important to the context of the case. So it 
19 can perhaps disprove or prove key statements, et 
20 cetera. 
21 We do a statistical measure of that 
22 to give weight to that evidence or to that match so 
23 the jury can determine is this a really good match, 
24 a really strong match or is it just so-so. 
25 There is two statistical models that 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XIX November 4, 2014 
Page 164 
1 were used in this case. The first is called the 
2 RMP, random match probability. Essentially, what 
3 that's saying is it's looking at a single source 
4 profile, so from one individual, and it is saying 
5 how rare is that profile. How often would we expect 
6 to encounter it in the general unrelated population. 
7 If that profile reaches a certain 
8 threshold of rarity, we are able to conclude that 
9 the profile came from an individual that's listed in 
10 the case if they match. So we can say this profile 
11 is unique and it matches this particular individual. 
12 The second statistic is used for 
13 mixtures, so you just need a slightly different 
14 model when you are dealing with a mixture versus a 
15 single source sample. So the particular statistic 
16 that was used is called a likelihood ratio. 
17 Again, this is used when you can 
18 determine the number of contributors. So earlier I 
19 said a major mixture of two individuals. That would 
20 be a case where you could use the likelihood ratio. 
21 You can go ahead and forward it. I'll get a little 
22 bit more information on that in a minute. 
23 This is just a slide, again, on 
24 random match probability. So, again, the way that 
25 we are able to determine how rare a profile is in 
FAX 314-241-6750

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Page 165 
1 the population, we do what are called population 
2 studies. 
3 So, essentially, a sample is taken 
4 from the population of the United States in our 
5 case, and they look to see how often are certain 
6 genome types detected, how often are certain alleles 
7 detected. 
8 So think of it as a parking lot where 
9 you are looking to see how rare or common a certain 
10 car is. So if you have a parking lot, it is your 
11 driveway, you have only two cars in there, it is 
12 probably not enough, not a large enough sample size 
13 to say, okay, this is a rare car or not. It is only 
14 two, but if you compare that to, let's say, a 
15 parking lot at Busch Stadium, where you have 
16 hundreds of thousands of cars, you can probably 
17 determine, okay, I see 50 Toyota Camrys and et 
18 cetera. 
19 So you can determine approximately 
20 how rare or common a particular allele is. So 
21 that's what the statistics are based on are these 
22 population data basis. 
23 The more locations that we use, the 
24 more discrimination the profile is, that is the 
25 better able we are to differentiate one profile from

1 another. 
2 So this is just a little bit more 
3 information. This is what I was saying about when 
4 it reaches a certain threshold of rarity, then we 
5 can conclude that there was a common source. So the 
6 evidence stain matches the suspect, for example. 
7 Very often you will see in the media 
8 where you read newspaper accounts of trials and 
9 things, they will very often say that the, they will 
10 quote the statistic as being the chance someone else 
11 committed the crime. That's called the prosecutors' 
12 policy, there is actually a name for it because it 
13 happens a lot, but that's not what we are looking at 
14 here. No offense. They don't do that, they're 
15 good. Again, we are just looking at the rarity of 
16 profile. It has nothing to do with the context of 
17 the case or, you know, anything to do with innocence 
18 or guilt. 
19 And there's also a defense attorney 
20 fallacy, and that assumption is everybody else with 
21 the same profile has an equal chance committing the 
22 crime. DNA statistics have nothing to do with 
23 access to the scene or any of those factors. 
24 Go ahead. We pointed this out 
25 earlier, but DNA testing and testimony will not

1 indicate how a stain was deposited. Again, we're 
2 just looking to inform the jury as to the likelihood 
3 that the DNA from a crime scene sample matches that 
4 of a particular individual. 
5 This is a little bit on the 
6 likelihood ratio, that's the stat we used when we 
7 have mixture. Basically it is just a mathematical 
8 way of saying how much particular hypothesis 
9 explains the evidence. 
10 So let's say in a rape case, for 
11 example, one hypothesis might be that victim and 
12 suspect explain the mixture. And the defense might 
13 say, well, I agree the victim is there, it is a 
14 vaginal swab, let's say, but that's not my guy. It 
15 is some random guy. 
16 So the defense hypothesis would be 
17 the mixture is explained by the victim and some 
18 unknown guy. So, essentially, we perform a 
19 statistic that just weighs those two options and 
20 determines which one is more likely. 
21 And this is just a verbal equivalent 
22 of what that number means. So if you have a 
23 likelihood ratio of one to ten, it is limited 
24 support for that hypothesis. 10 to 100 is moderate 
25 support, on and on. Anything over 10,000 is very

1 strong evidence is to support that hypothesis. 
2 This is just a real quick summary of 
3 what we do. Obviously, we interpret the profiles 
4 first, then we compare it to any reference 
5 standards. If there's a probative inclusion, we 
6 give statistical weight. We complete the report and 
7 then we submit it to technical administrative 
8 review. 
9 So there's a second qualified analyst 
10 that's required to review everything in the report. 
11 All the processing documentation, just to make sure 
12 that they agree with the assumptions and everything 
13 that was done. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question about 
15 that because testified about there being a 
16 technical review. Does the reviewer run the same 
17 test as you to see if they are getting the same 
18 result, or they just looking at your work to see 
19 that it was done correctly? 
20 A They look at my work to make sure that it 
21 was done correctly. 
22 
23 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
I don't know, we can leave this up while

3 MS. ALIZADEH: I can pass out --
4 MS. WHIRLEY: That report is Grand Jury

15 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So basically you get the 
16 items, for example, the person that was here earlier 
17 who did the screening for DNA, she didn't do any 
18 analysis, she just checked the swabs, did a report, 
19 forwarded it to your DNA section? 
A Yes. 
Q And then what do you do? 
20 
21

1 Q Okay. So we're passing out the reports 
2 that you prepared, these are reports that you 
3 prepared, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q And tell us what the Q1 and the K1 and 2, 
6 what does that mean? 
7 A Sure. That's the item designation that's 
8 given in the laboratory. So that would be what 
9 designated it as. 
10 If you look on the first page of my 
11 report, there's in parentheses after each item, it 
12 says Item Number, for example, Q1-1. At the end it 
13 says Item Number 3 and that's referencing crime 
14 scene designation. 
15 Q Okay. And on her report, I don't have it 
16 in front of me, let me look and see. Like when she 
17 does, I have it, thank you though. Her report where 
18 it says Q1 specimen, now yours says us Q1-1. Tell 
19 us about that, what's the difference? 
20 A Yes. So any time an item is separated or 
21 a sample is taken from an item, it gets a new item

Q What was your conclusion about that? 1 
2 A The DNA typing results obtained from Q5 
3 are consistent with being a mixture of two or more 
4 individuals. This profile can be separated into a 
5 major component profile consistent with Michael 
6 Brown and a minor contributor. 
7 There was an additional allele that 
8 indicates a possible trace contributor, but again, 
9 that was inconclusive. 
10 PO Wilson is included possibility 
11 minor contributor profile. So then the next 
12 sentence is the likelihood ratio where it is giving 
13 weight to that statement. The observed mixture 
14 profile is 98 times more likely if it originated 
15 from Michael Brown and PO Wilson than it originated 
16 from Michael Brown and an unknown individual in the 
17 general unrelated population. 
18 Q And that's kind of, I don't want to say 
19 confusing, when you say 98 times more if it 
20 originated from Michael Brown and PO Wilson. So you 
21 are not confirming that it did originate from those 
22 two? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Okay. So how is it probative of anything? 
Urn, so in this case generally with any

1 case when you have DNA from a particular individual 
2 and another individual, then it's potentially 
3 probative. So if there were accounts that there was 
4 a struggle and we find DNA from individual A on 
5 individual B, then it's probative. 
6 Q Okay. We know it is Michael Brown, 
7 correct, as the major contributor? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q And are you saying that it's more likely 
10 that it is PO Wilson is the minor contributor? 
11 A That's correct, then if it were an unknown 
12 person in the general population.

14 that? Okay, all right.

3 Wilson's vehicle. 
4 Q13 and Q14 are reddish brown stains 
5 from the roadway in front of 2943 Canfield.

Okay. Sure. So this sample was from a 
15 reddish brown stain on the upper left thigh of PO 
16 Wilson's uniform pants. DNA from Q15 are consistent 
17 with being a mixture of two or more individuals. 
18 This profile can be separated into a major male 
19 component profile and a minor contributor consistent 
20 with PO Wilson. 
21 One additional allele indicates 
22 possible trace contributor. Again, that's 
23 inconclusive. Michael Brown is the source of the

1 you talked about there could be more than two that 
2 trace, you can't say what that is, but it is not 
3 either of these two individuals? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q Okay. And then on Q16, since we are in 
6 that area. 
7 A Urn, Q16 was a swab from the top exterior 
8 left front door of the vehicle. The DNA typing 
9 results obtained from Q16 are consistent with the 
10 mixture of three or more individuals. This profile 
11 can be separated into a major mixture of two 
12 individuals, with a trace contributor, and the trace 
13 contributor is inconclusive. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A And then this is the likelihood ratio 
16 statistic again. Michael Brown and PO Wilson are 
17 included as contributors to this major mixture 
18 profile. The observed major mixture profile is 6.9 
19 million times more likely if it originated from 
20 Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it originated

1 Q And then for Q17, which was the exterior 
2 left front door mirror of vehicle 108, there was 
3 limited amount of genetic information to make any 
4 determination regarding the officer or Michael 
5 Brown? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q Okay. How about Q18? 
8 A Sure. Q18 was the interior left front 
9 door handle of the vehicle. The DNA typing results 
10 obtained from Q18 are consistent with being a 
11 mixture of two or more individuals. This profile 
12 can be separated into a major male contributor 
13 profile and one or more minor contributors. Michael 
14 Brown is the source of the major male contributor 
15 profile. Due to the limited genetic information 
16 available from the minor component, the presence or 
17 absence from PO Wilson cannot be determined.

Assuming she was able to confirm it. 
MS. ALIZADEH: That's what I was going to 
13 say. Do you know if it was presumptive? 
14 A I believe on this item it was presumptive, 
15 I don't believe there was enough there to do the 
16 confirmatory test. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: You do have enough to get a 
18 DNA profile, you did get a DNA profile from the 
19 weapon? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
(By Ms. Whirley) You can't say again 
22 whether it was blood or skin cell?

Q So tell us about the weapon. 1 
2 A Okay. The DNA testing results obtained 
3 from Q19 are consistent with being a mixture of 
4 three or more individuals. This profile can be 
5 separated into a major mixture of two individuals 
6 with a trace contributor. Again, the trace 
7 contributor is inconclusive. Michael Brown and PO 
8 Wilson are included as contributors to this major 
9 mixture profile. 
10 The observed major mixture profile is 
11 2.1 octillion times more likely if it originated 
12 from Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it 
13 originated from PO Wilson and an unknown individual 
14 in the general unrelated population. 
15 Q And again, we're talking about a number so 
16 high, you know, as many, many, many more times than 
17 the population of the whole world before you find 
18 another profile like this? 
19 A Well, this is actually the likelihood 
20 ratio statistic, so it is a little bit different on 
21 the assumptions, but that hypothesis has very, very, 
22 strong support. 
23 Q Okay, all right. And this is, I don't 
24 know if you have some different numbers somewhere 
25 else. This is a pretty important part of what they

1 need to know, the DNA on the gun. So what can you 
2 tell us about the DNA on the gun again? 
3 A The hypothesis that it's these two 
4 individuals, PO Wilson and Michael Brown, is 2.1 
5 octillion times more likely than it was PO Wilson 
6 and some unknown. 
7 Q When you say hypothesis, what do you mean? 
8 A Basically it's just how well that 
9 hypothesis explains the data. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
What does hypothesis mean? 
Hypothesis would be that supposing that 
12 these two particular individuals contributed it 
13 versus another individual and PO Wilson. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: Questions on that? 
16 Let me understand this, 
17 So are you saying his DNA was on 
18 the gun? 
19 A That statement is supported by the data, 
20 yes. 
21 You can't 
22 determine if it was from skin cells or fluid? 
23 A Correct. The DNA profile would be the 
24 same throughout your body, so we're not able to 
25 determine if the DNA profile originated from blood

1 or skin cells. 
2 Yes. 
3 You talked 
4 about the door, the front door handle? 
5 A Yes. 
6 You could tell it was 
7 Michael Brown? 
8 
9 
A Yes. 
He was the more major 
10 contributor. So if he was the last person to touch 
11 it, would his DNA, would it have overrode whoever 
12 touched it prior? 
13 A It's possible, yes. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) There's evidence that, or 
15 information that, and you probably know this 
16 already, you get some information from the police 
17 when you are doing this testing, correct? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Some. 
There was a shooting involved in the car? 
Yes. 
And then there was blood and actually some 
22 blood swabs were submitted, correct? 
23 A Yes, and I believe at the time of the 
24 testing, I don't know that I actually knew of a 
25 shooting.

A 
Q 
Page 184 
But you know now before I told you? 
I do know now. 
So if his DNA is on the gun and the car 
4 and the door of the car, there's no way you can tell 
5 us is it because he touched the gun or because his 
6 blood may have been on there or some other portion, 
7 sweat or saliva, probably not saliva, but some other 
8 bodily fluids, you can't tell us exactly how his DNA 
9 got on that gun? 
10 
11 
12 
A That's correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Any questions on that? 
I do, I just 
13 have a question about Number 11, 12, 13 and 14. It 
14 says apparent tissue or hardened nasal mucus from 
15 vehicle 108. And it says apparent tissue or 
16 hardened nasal mucus 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: If you recall that was 
18 Officer testified that he used a pair of 
19 tweezers to remove something from the outside of the 
20 door. 
21 There was, none of this 
22 was from inside of the door?

1 MS. ALIZADEH: But there are swabs taken 
2 from the inside of the door that she's testified 
3 about from the door handle, and that's the interior

5 Interior door handle. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: I believe so.

8 So interior left front

12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Again, we don't know how 
13 the DNA got there? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Okay. Let's go onto, were we done with 
16 Q19? 
17 What my question 
18 is, Q11, they introduced that to us a long time ago. 
19 We don't know what it is. If you can answer any 
20 more, was the suggestion that it was a hardened 
21 nasal mucus just an assumption because it looked 
22 that way? 
23 A That's correct, but the biologist, she 
24 actually called me in to kind of look at it and just 
25 see what I thought. We didn't know what it was,

2 Would there be any way of 
3 knowing 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It's been tested. 
5 We know he had a close 
6 range wound to his hand. Is there any way of 
7 knowing, could have been skin that came off his hand 
8 or not any way of knowing that? 
9 A I'm not sure. I know I can't determine 
10 that from DNA. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Dr. is going to 
12 return to talk about because that tissue, that 
13 hardened nasal mucus tissue was forwarded to him for 
14 his testing. He's going to come back tomorrow and 
15 tell you what he found that to be. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Thursday. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Or Thursday. 
18 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So Q20-1, I'm sorry, were 
19 there any other questions before we go on? 
20 Q20-1. Tell us about that. 
21 A Those were swabs from PO Wilson's uniform 
22 shirt. They were from the left side and the collar 
23 area, and I believe testified regarding 
24 that. The DNA typing results obtained from Q20-1 
25 are consistent with being a mixture of three or more

1 individuals. This profile can be separated into a 
2 major mixture of two individuals with a trace 
3 component. And again, the trace component is 
4 inconclusive. 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
MS. ALIZADEH: Again, what? 
The trace component is inconclusive. 
(By Ms. Whirley) So that's that person 
8 other than Michael Brown and PO Wilson? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay, go ahead. 
Michael Brown and PO Wilson are included 
12 as contributors to this major mixture profile. The 
13 observed major mixture profile is 2.1 trillion times 
14 more like that it originated from Michael Brown and 
15 PO Wilson, than if it originated from PO Wilson and 
16 an unknown individual in the general unrelated 
17 population. 
18 Q Okay. So again, we don't know how his DNA 
19 got on his shirt? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. Questions on that one? 
Q21-1. 
23 A This was PO Wilson's uniform pants on the 
24 left side. The DNA typing results are consistent 
25 with being a mixture of three or more individuals.

1 This profile can be separated into a major mixture 
2 of two individuals with a trace component, and the 
3 trace component is inconclusive. 
4 Michael Brown and PO Wilson are 
5 included as contributors to this major mixture 
6 profile. The observed major mixture profile is 34 
7 sextillion times more likely it originated from 
8 Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it originated 
9 from PO Wilson and an unknown individual in the 
10 general unrelated population. 
11 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Q 
So those are on the pants? 
Yes. 
Now, we started with Q5 and we talked 
14 about things of evidentiary value. K1-1 is Michael 
15 Brown's shirt, and you did not consider that to be 
16 of evidentiary value because it said that Wilson is 
17 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile? 
18 A Well, I started with samples that I 
19 performed statistical measures on and when we do 
20 exclusions, there is no statistical measure. 
21 can certainly get those results now. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. Go ahead. 
So Q1-1 was Michael Brown's T-shirt. 
So I 
I 
24 believe this is where attempted to swab areas 
25 that did not appear to have blood staining. The DNA

1 typing results obtained from Q1-1 are consistent 
2 with being a mixture of two or more individuals. 
3 This profile can be separated into a major component 
4 profile consistent with Michael Brown and one or 
5 more trace contributors. 
6 And then, again, there's limited 
7 genetic information from the trace component, so 
8 inclusionary statements can be made regarding this 
9 portion of the mixture. 
10 However, PO Wilson is excluded as a 
11 contributor to this mixture profile. 
12 Q So that means whatever the trace component 
13 was did not have any of the alleles or any of the 
14 profile of Officer Wilson? 
15 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
So Q2-1? 
This was Michael Brown's shorts. The DNA 
18 typing results obtained from Q2-1 are consistent 
19 with being a mixture of three or more individuals. 
20 This profile can be separated into a major component 
21 profile consistent with Michael Brown and two or 
22 more trace contributors. Due to the limited genetic 
23 information available from the trace component of 
24 the mixture, no inclusionary statements will be made 
25 regarding the trace component. PO Wilson is

1 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile. 
2 Q So to say the thing that we said earlier, 
3 none of those little points or the alleles match 
4 Officer Wilson? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
If one of two would have matched, you 
7 would have said what? 
A It is possible that maybe one or two did, 8 
9 but overall he was excluded. So if you have one or 
10 two, it's possible you just might have adventitious 
11 inclusion, I guess, because people do share alleles, 
12 they share peaks, but when you look across an entire 
13 profile, that's how when you are able to determine 
14 if they are excluded or not. 
15 Q Do you use a certain number of peaks or 
16 alleles to make an exclusion? 
17 A There is really not a specific number, it 
18 is just dependent on the mixture. But again, if 
19 there are peaks that are foreign to the individual 
20 then they're excluded. 
21 Q So in this case, is that what we are 
22 seeing is that they were foreign to Officer Wilson? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes. 
The trace amounts, those alleles? 
Yes.

1 Q Anything else of evidentiary value that we 
2 missed? 
3 A I think the only other items that we have 
4 discussed would be the swabs from Michael Brown's 
5 other portions of his body, his hands. 
6 Q Okay. We'll talk about that. Is there a 
7 question? 
8 So on Q1-1, the 
9 report talks about possible Police Officer Wilson 
10 grabbed the shirt of Michael Brown, from what you 
11 seen from the area that was tested, you didn't get 
12 enough markers to verify that that's true. From 
13 what you've seen you didn't get any police officer's 
14 DNA off of that shirt? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Anyone else? Okay. 
17 On that other report, which is Grand 
18 Jury Exhibit Number 74, was there, tell us about 
19 that, what you concluded in that analysis. 
20 A The second report consisted of additional 
21 items that I was requested to process. There was 
22 Cardinals baseball hat, two Nike sandals, the right 
23 and the left. Actually, there was, yes, there was 
24 two sandals and there were two swabs taken from each 
25 of those sandals. So there's four swabs from the

1 sandals. And there were also two bracelets, one of 
2 them was a black, yellow and white rubber bracelet, 
3 and the other one was a dark brown beaded bracelet. 
4 Q Were you able to, I see where you have the 
5 buccal swab referenced for Officer Wilson and the 
6 blood referenced for Michael Brown. Were you able 
7 to find any profiles on those bracelets? 
8 A I was able to obtain a mixture on each 
9 one. You want me to 
10 Q Yes, please. 
11 A So on the black, yellow and white rubber 
12 band bracelet, the DNA typing results obtained from 
13 that item Q25-1, are consistent with being a mixture 
14 of two or more individuals. This profile can be 
15 separated into a major male component profile and 
16 one or more minor contributors. Due to the limited 
17 genetic information available from the minor 
18 component of the mixture, no inclusionary statements 
19 will be made regarding the minor component. Michael 
20 Brown and PO Wilson are excluded as contributors of 
21 the major male component profile, however, I 
22 couldn't determine if they were present as possible 
23 minor contributors. 
24 Q There wasn't enough of a DNA profile to 
25 make the connection?

Page 193 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q Okay. That's for the yellow and black, 
3 yellow and white rubber bracelet. And then the dark 
4 brown bracelet, did the same determination? 
5 A It was essentially the same. On this 
6 particular item there was a mixture of three or four 
7 individuals instead of a mixture of two or more, but 
8 again, there was a major male component profile and 
9 then two or more minor contributors, but they were 
10 excluded as the major contributor. 
11 Q Then going to the first page, the 
12 Cardinals baseball cap. 
13 A That profile was single source. Michael 
14 Brown was the source of that DNA profile. And then 
15 Q24-1 was the reddish brown stain on the right Nike 
16 sandal, that was also Michael Brown. 
17 Q Okay. When you say single source, you 
18 mean no mixture, just straight one source? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Does that pretty much conclude that second 
21 supplemental report? 
22 A The only other item would be swabs from, 
23 again, the second set of swabs from the left and 
24 right sandals and those results were inconclusive, 
25 so I wasn't able to do any conclusions on them.

2 correct? 
3 A No. 
4 Q All right. 
5 Did you 
6 do anything with the clippings of the fingernails? 
7 A Yes. That was in the first report and 
8 those were consistent with Michael Brown. Let me 
9 see where that is. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is that Q10? 
A Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Q9, Q10? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Let's see, Q9-1, Michael Brown's left hand 
14 fingernail scrapings. This was a mixture, so again, 
15 this is Q9-1. It was consistent with being a 
16 mixture of three or more individuals. This profile 
17 can be separated into a major component profile 
18 consistent with Michael Brown and two or more trace 
19 contributors. Due to the limited genetic 
20 information available from the trace component of 
21 the mixture, no inclusionary statements will be made 
22 regarding the trace component PO Wilson is excluded 
23 as a contributor to this mixture profile. 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. WHIRLEY: Q10? 
And then Q10 was a single source profile

State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XIX November 4, 2014

1 and it was consistent with Michael Brown. 
2 Q6 and Q8 
3 backs of Michael Brown's hands, looks like there's 
4 no Officer Wilson's DNA on the backs of his hands? 
5 A That's correct, it is a single source 
6 profile consistent with Michael Brown. 
7 We had heard that Michael 
8 Brown was punching the officer in the face. Would 
9 you say that's inconsistent with those reports? 
10 A Well, on these particular items, it has 
11 RBS after it, reddish brown stain. So it is 
12 possible that PO Wilson isn't there, it's also 
13 possible he is not being detected due to the blood 
14 on the hand. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you this also. 
16 When it says that the backs of the hands were 
17 swabbed, and I guess we would have to talk to 
18 whoever swabbed them, we don't know if that includes 
19 the knuckles or back of the hand? 
20 
21 
A Yes, I'm not aware.

22 your notes to say where on the back of the hand it 
23 was swabbed, correct? 
24 A

1 didn't include that and we don't know? 
A Yes. 2 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: And also just to clarify, 
4 you did not have a known sample from a Dorian 
5 Johnson, did you? 
6 A No, I did not. 
7 Back to Michael 
8 Brown. I guess is it safe to say that the areas 
9 that would have been in contact with PO Officer 
10 Darren Wilson, like neck, shoulders, was not swabbed 
11 due to the blood? 
12 
13 
A I believe that's correct, yes. 
I'm confused 
14 by that. But you did say you got DNA from his 
15 shirt, from Michael Brown, correct? 
16 A On PO Wilson's shirt. 
17 He was talking about 
18 Michael Brown's shirt, which is my original 
19 question. You said that just because you weren't 
20 able to get Officer Wilson's DNA on his fist, on his 
21 hand, it could have been overwhelmed by the blood 
22 that was there? 
23 A That's one possibility, yes. 
24 Or it could not have been 
25 there at all?

6 well, Q6, Q7 and Q8. 
7 He had 
8 blood on both left and right hand?

10 yes. 
11 (sic) 
12 Back to Q25 and 26, something the prosecutor brought 
13 up. If you had DNA samples, would you have enough 
14 markers to compare it to known DNA? 
15 A From the major component, yes. 
16 The 
17 fingernail clippings and scrapings, were they 
18 separate, did they scrape them and also clip them, 
19 or was it just the clippings? And if it was just 
20 the clippings, could that have been, have 
21 deteriorated DNA?

A That they were clippings. 1 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: And that she swabbed the 
3 clippings. 
4 A Right, because what I received is just a 
5 portion of the original item. So I just get a 
6 little tube with something inside, so I don't know. 
7 In the 
8 report it says here that the contributors not 
9 identify, were unable to identify that, the example 
10 is put it in CODIS; is that correct, is that my 
11 understanding? 
12 A Yes, at the very end there are two samples 
13 that were entered into CODIS. 
14 Do they stay in CODIS for 
15 a specific amount of time or just in case somebody 
16 might pop up? 
17 A So just a little bit of background on 
18 CODIS. There is actually three levels of CODIS. 
19 There's a local level, state level and national 
20 level. So the national level is the most 
21 restrictive. There's a number of rules about what 
22 can go in. It has to be something from the scene of 
23 a crime. It cannot be from the victim, it cannot be 
24 from a witness in the crime, for example. But as 
25 you move down to the local levels it gets less

1 restrictive. 
2 So, for example, all the analyst 
3 profiles are in our local database. Any reference 
4 standard from the list of the suspect is entered 
5 locally. 
6 The Missouri State Attorney General 
7 has made a ruling at the state level we can maintain 
8 those suspect profiles. So we enter the suspect 
9 known at our level and it stays at the state level. 
10 It does not move to the national level. 
11 Any unknown sample, we call it a case 
12 work unknown sample. And this example of Q12, which 
13 was consistent with Michael Brown, and I believe 
14 that was from the vehicle. That was entered into 
15 CODIS and that would go to the national level. 
16 I want to go 
17 back to Q1-1, Michael Brown's T-shirt again to make 
18 sure I'm clear. The last line says PO Wilson is 
19 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile. 
20 So that tells he is not part of whatever stain is on 
21 that shirt. 
22 A He was not detected, that's correct. 
23 And they also swabbed some 
24 of the non stained areas of that shirt and did not 
25 find any DNA in that area either?

1 A I believe Q1-1 was from the non stained 
2 areas. 
3 Okay. 
4 A She did not swab the stained areas 
5 because, again, we would expect to find Michael 
6 Brown's blood. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: And that's pretty much 
8 protocol or standard not to swab an area that is 
9 bloody like that, just too much and the person who 
10 bled? 
11 A Right, and DNA testing is expensive and 
12 time consuming so we try to restrict the number of 
13 samples to something that can provide information in 
14 the case. 
15 Q There's just no way to know until it was 
16 requested? 
17 A Right. 
18 Q So what do you do after you complete your 
19 analysis, what do you do with all this stuff? 
20 A All the samples, in this particular case 
21 for a time, I believe, the FBI were intentionally 
22 going to take it and place it in a vault in 
23 preparation for them to take. The particular items 
24 that I tested, I don't believe they ended up taking. 
25 So we boxed them up for long-term storage.

You have custody of them? 
They're in the laboratory, yes. 
Do you know what items the FBI did test 
4 and they took the items that you tested, is that 
5 what you said? 
6 A They informed me that they don't repeat 
7 something that has already been done, so they would 
8 do testing in addition to what our laboratory 
9 performs. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
So I don't know that. 
I'm not aware that they retested anything 
12 that I tested. 
13 Q And you don't know what they did test? 
14 A No. 
15 Q Okay. Here is a question I guess you 
16 posed for me, do you keep items, why do you keep the 
17 items for? 
A The cuttings and all of the envelopes and 18 
19 things that would have taken. We do retain it 
20 for possible defense retesting. So we try not to 
21 consume any samples. And if we do have to consume a 
22 sample, we have to obtain permission from the 
23 prosecutor's office or whoever maybe if there is a 
24 suspect in the case.

1 anything to do with the monitoring of radio traffic 
2 in St. Louis County? 
3 A I did, and I still have access because it 
4 helps me troubleshoot a lot of things. 
5 Q Okay. And so we've already heard 
6 testimony so we're not going to need a detailed 
7 description, but you, of course, you are familiar 
8 with the RIOT channels that St. Louis County has?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And how many RIOT channels are there? 
I believe there's four. 
And they are A, B, C and D then? 
Right. 
And so we have already again heard talk 
15 about what they are and how they work and when 
16 they're in use. 
17 But when transmissions are received 
18 on the RIOT channel in the communication center, are 
19 those transmissions recorded? 
20 A Yes, if they're actually heard they would 
21 be recorded. 
22 Q Okay. So there's an audio recording of 
23 transmissions, correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Is there also a record that's made that

1 that transmission is actually received so there 
2 would be a date stamp, a time stamp with each 
3 transmission that's heard? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Okay. And were you asked during the 
6 course of the investigation into the shooting of 
7 Michael Brown, were you aware that there was some 
8 issue about whether or not a call was made on a RIOT 
9 channel? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Not until you had asked. 
Okay. So, and let's go back on August 9th 
12 of 2014, were you, do you recall that and were you 
13 aware that there was an incident that occurred down 
14 in South County at the St. Anthony's Hospital in one 
15 of their hospice care facilities? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And were you aware that there were a 
18 number of officers and County TAC responded, they 
19 had a staging area and so forth; is that correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And were you aware that on that, for that 
22 incident that the County Police had switched over 
23 and were broadcasting on RIOT A? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750

are 
8 Q And now you told me, we talked about this 
9 briefly out here just now that when you pull a 
10 segment of calls or time segment, that has to be in 
11 ten-minute increments; is that correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And so did you pull all the calls for the 
14 times that I requested and burned those onto a disc? 
15 
16

Are those the calls that you pulled that I 
Yes. 
(Grand Jury Exhibit Number 71 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And then did I, did you 
7 also provide for me a print-out that I've marked 
8 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 71, that shows the dates 
9 and times of those calls? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. So the first call that is 
12 recorded on Grand Jury 60 is a call from August 9th 
13 at 11:43, 11:00 a.m., I'm sorry, let me back up. 
14 11:43 and 15 seconds in the a.m.? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
All right. And then the record, which is 
17 Grand Jury Exhibit 71, date and time stamps it and 
18 says how long the call lasts; is that correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And now the next column says caller 
21 number, but there is nothing in there? 
22 A Correct. That would show like if it was a 
23 911 call, would show the number that came in. 
24 Q Okay. And then for the column that says 
25 channel name, it is all of those are RIOT A calls?

A 
Q 
Page 208 
Correct. 
Okay. And then what is the, the next 
3 column says location, what does that mean? 
4 A That's the DVD that it's on. For 
5 instance, 549, that's the 549th CD we have stuck in 
6 there to record. 
7 Q So these calls are not maintained on a 
8 hard drive someplace? 
9 A They are for about probably three weeks 
10 and then they are archived to this. 
11 Q So regardless of whether I ask for these, 
12 I could get calls from a year ago, correct? 
13 A We keep them that long, yeah. 
14 Q So when you got these calls for me it was 
15 more than three weeks past August 9th, is that fair 
16 to say? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And so that location means you were able 
19 to determine what DVD it was on? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
22 records. 
Exactly. 
Okay. And I'm going to pass out these 
23 So the first call that was reported, 
24 I already mentioned, is at 11:43 and 15 seconds in 
25 the a.m. And then the last call recorded is at 2:06

1 and 31 minutes, I'm sorry, 2:06 and 31 seconds in 
2 the p.m., correct? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q I mean, that's more than a ten-minute 
5 increment? 
6 A Right. 
7 Q You get these? 
8 A What I was doing was trying to show when 
9 it ended and when it started and any traffic in 
10 between. 
11 Q Okay. Now, are you aware that the 
12 incident at the St. Anthony's hospice facility, did 
13 that start before 11:43:15 a.m.? 
14 A Way before it, yes. 
15 Q So were you aware then that the county had 
16 already notified their officers to, that were 
17 involved in that incident, to switch over to RIOT A? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And so that transmission is not included 
20 in what you've gotten me, right? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No. 
And then down here you have a reference on 
23 August 9th, 2014 at 12:35:35 p.m., St. Anthony

2 something that you came up with? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
A I just came up with it because at that 
point on the tape or the CD is when they secured 
channel. In other words, we're done. 
Q So there is actually an audio recording 
an officer's voice, we are clearing the RIOT A 
channel. In other words, the incident has ended, 
9 you can tune back to dispatch or whatever? 
A Correct. 
the 
of 
10 
11 Q Okay. And then you also indicate at about 
12 2:00p.m. and 26 seconds on the same day, it says 
13 RIOT A for Ferguson, and again, that was, you 
14 determined, that is your phrase? 
15 A That is my phrase from what was said on 
16 the audio. 
17 Q Okay. So there's an audio of an officer 
18 activating the RIOT A channel because of the 
19 Ferguson incident? 
A Correct. 
Q And that was at 2:00p.m.? 
A Yes.

Is there a call for officer in need of 
Not that I heard. 
Is there a call that says something like 
10 send every car you've got? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Never heard that. 
All right. And now I've listened to the 
13 calls also and I asked you out there, there's some 
14 of these calls actually is a series of tones and 
15 there's nobody speaking? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q Why are those calls, what is that? 
18 A That's an FCC regulation where each 
19 channel has a frequency and you have to either 
20 broadcast yourself, the call signal over it, and for 
21 instance, normal everyday traffic, you'd say KWA 
22 519, that's our call signal. On a channel that's 
23 not used very often, it is an automatic identifier 
24 that goes out, it is a tone.

FAX 314-241-6750

8 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any more 
9 questions. My questions for you, jurors, is do you 
10 want to hear these calls? They're not very long. 
11 Obviously, some of them are five seconds in 
12 duration, six seconds, 14 seconds. We could listen 
13 to all of them in a matter of less than ten minutes. 
14 Of course, this would be available if you all want 
15 to listen to it yourself at a later date, but that's 
16 up to you. Do you have an interest in hearing these 
17 calls? 
18 
19 Q 
MS. WHIRLEY: I had a question for 
(By Ms. Whirley) This RIOT A for Ferguson, 
20 these are not Ferguson's communications to their own 
21 communication system, this is them on county's 
22 communication system? 
23 A I'd have to hear it, but I believe it was 
24 county activating the RIOT channel. Normally most 
25 of your municipalities that are going to use it at

1 the very beginning you can hear a couple people just 
2 talking. They don't identify themselves. I can 
3 recognize one of the names. It was a guy in the St. 
4 Anthony's. They'll use it, they'll use that channel 
5 just, hey, meet me over at McDonald's or something, 
6 they will talk car to car kind of thing. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A But usually an activation is done by the 
9 county. 
10 Q And I'm sure it was said already, just to 
11 make sure I'm clear. A municipality like Ferguson 
12 can access that RIOT A channel and talk to other 
13 officers and other departments? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Okay. But it is really a channel that is 
16 maintained by County? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q All right. On this channel, all of these 
19 other calls, like the St. Anthony's secure and the 
20 calls previous to that, all dealt with something 
21 that was happening at St. Anthony's? 
A You can tell one of the cars, you could 22 
23 hear a guy say , he is on the SWAT team. 
24 Q But they are not like communications where 
25 they are calling into dispatch and announcing their

1 location or their arrival, or asking for assistance 
2 or anything like that, it is just sort of an 
3 informal communication amongst officers on this 
4 channel? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And just to clarify, 
7 because Sheila asked you, officers in municipalities 
8 can use this to talk to each other, but the other 
9 person has to be monitoring the RIOT A channel? 
10 
11 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So it is not like if 
12 someone transmits something on a RIOT A, it is not 
13 suddenly everybody switches over to RIOT A because 
14 there was transmission? 
15 A No, you usually have a few, the smaller 
16 municipalities, they'll know. Let's say I'm 
17 Dellwood and you're something else, Bellefontaine. 
18 We know, hey, monitor this channel and I will call 
19 you when I need you, not call when I need you. I 
20 will just talk to you whenever I want you to 
21 monitor. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: We also heard some 
23 testimony, you know ; is that right?

1 me up with him so he could explain how radio traffic 
2 works, right? 
3 A Yeah. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: And so we heard him testify 
5 about that emergency button or the orange button 
6 that was on the walkie-talkie. And he said that no 
7 matter what channel an officer is on, when that 
8 button is pressed, it automatically switches, it

10 officer's department. 
11 Now my question to you is, if that button 
12 is pressed by an officer in a municipality who is 
13 not on RIOT A, but might be on another channel, 
14 would you hear it on RIOT A? 
A No. 15 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: If that button is pressed 
17 while the officer is on RIOT A, because 
18 testified about how that tone, the data bursts that 
19 are sent out when that button is pressed, are going 
20 to go through, they are going to override everything 
21 else? 
22 
23 
A Uh-huh. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So if that button is 
24 pressed when the radio is on the RIOT A channel, 
25 whatever channel that might be for the municipality,

1 would you hear it on the, would you be able to hear 
2 it on the RIOT A monitoring, when you are monitoring 
3 RIOT A? 
4 A Well, County is different. I think the 
5 way described it is Ferguson does automatic, is 
6 programmed to automatically, no matter what channel 
7 I'm on, if I press it, it is going back to the 
8 Ferguson main. So, no, we never hear it. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: It is not going back to 
10 County, just Ferguson? 
11 
12 
A 
13 question. 
Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I know you had a 
14 GRAND JUROR 12: It shows the RIOT A for 
15 Ferguson started at 2:00. I know you were asking 
16 questions about you hear anybody asking for help, 
17 but this would have been, they would have secured 
18 this channel after the incident happened, correct? 
19 A They didn't secure it, they started it up. 
20 They started the RIOT 
21 channel after the initial incident --
22 
23 
A Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: These are officers talking

1 officer asking dispatcher for help, this is officers 
2 talking to each other about the aftermath of. 
3 A No, when St. Anthony secured, we shut down 
4 the RIOT channel. There is nobody sitting there 
5 monitoring, listening, we shut it down. Ferguson 
6 happens, all of the phone calls made.

The incident at Ferguson. 
The incident happened. 
That was around noon-ish. So that happens 
12 and all the phone calls are made and then the 
13 decision, commander decides let's move everything 
14 over to the RIOT channel. 
15 So my question, just so I 
16 get everything, this is not, this is not going to 
17 tell us whether Officer Wilson called in for help or 
18 anything, this is just going to tell us that after 
19 the fact they secured this channel for what they 
20 needed?

1 dispatcher, it would not be on here? 
2 A No, this is strictly St. Louis County. 
3 They started using this 
4 channel after the incident? 
5 A After the incident, code 2000 they call 
6 it, and they activated the RIOT channel. 
7 They activated the RIOT 
8 channel to assist with the aftermath of what 
9 happened? 
10 
11 
A Yeah. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Again, just to be clear, if 
12 for the sake of assumption, if Officer Wilson had 
13 broadcast or had transmitted something on the RIOT 
14 channel, it may have been received and recorded, 
15 correct? 
16 A Correct. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: But we've already heard 
18 from that there are these voting recorders 
19 or receivers and they selected a transmission that's 
20 best quality and so it might get, might not have 
21 been received? 
22 
23 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. On your report, 
24 it says from August 9th, 2014, from 11:52:32 seconds

1 indicate that there was no transmission between that 
2 time period? 
3 A No, say that again, though, you say --
4 MS. WHIRLEY: 11:52 and 12:04 on the RIOT 
5 channel, was there any transmission? Because it 
6 looks like the duration of 11:52, was that six 
7 seconds? 
8 A Yeah, okay, it picked up something at 
9 11:52 for six seconds. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Right. So after that six 
11 seconds was over, is there nothing else that was 
12 picked up until 12:04? 
13 A Correct. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: So if someone was on the 
15 RIOT channel, that would have been recorded?

MS. WHIRLEY: Between that time period? 
Yeah. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Between 11:52 and 12:04, if 
20 there was nobody else transmitting. 
21 A Yeah, any kind of break in time in there, 
22 there's no audio to record it. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify. I believe 
24 talked about the fact that a lot depended 
25 upon where the transmission was made from?

6 Do you 
7 know how far Ferguson's tower is from Canfield by 
8 any chance? 
A For the RIOT channel? 
Just distance. 
9 
10 
11 A There are different frequencies or 
12 different towers. So, for instance, I can speak for 
13 the county. The county's tower is at Seven Hills 
14 and Halls Ferry. So that's where our RIOT receiver 
15 would be. 
16 Okay. 
17 A But as far as Ferguson and their local 
18 town their frequency, no clue. 
19 I think we were told it 
20 was in the back of the police? 
21 A There is a tower back there, but I don't 
22 know if it's a cell tower or what's actually on it.

24 is a cell tower, go ahead.

MS. ALIZADEH: I had told you I was going

5 out again. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Was that all of your 
7 questions? Just the distance, or you wanted to 
8 know, was he able to transmit? 
9 If like the line of sight 
10 wasn't available, even if he would have been on 
11 Ferguson, which he may or may not have been, could 
12 it have still been picked up, for lack of a better 
13 term, a dead zone? 
14 A We have a lot of those, believe it or not, 
15 throughout the whole county. That's part of the new 
16 radio system we're building. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: To correct those issue? 
18 A Correct all of those issues. 
19 Earlier 
20 you said something about a 911 call, if there would 
21 have been one, caller's number would have showed up

MS. ALIZADEH: I have those, yes. You

9 A I have made several different ones, I 
10 don't know if I made the 911 calls for you. 
11 
12 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
To give you an idea, the traffic and our 
13 recorder is 120 channels. It is very tough just to 
14 say give me the calls pertaining to Ferguson. I 
15 couldn't sit there, it would take me two years to 
16 play every call and figure out what had to do with 
17 it. The ones that I made, here they are, you know, 
18 pick out what you want and let me know and I will 
19 try put them in order or go back and record just 
20 those incidents. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I do have a disc that has 
22 911 calls on it and, you know, there are some that 
23 have to do with this. I don't want to characterize 
24 them as they don't really help you with anything

1 that to be my judgment, but if you want to hear 
2 that, I have them. 
3 A Just to give you an idea, they have their 
4 own 911 center. So if they call from landline, they 
5 are going to Ferguson. 
6 So what the county took could have 
7 been cell calls that hit a tower facing, that is 
8 pointed to the county as opposed to Ferguson? 
9 That's where I was going 
10 with that, I was just wondering if there were any 
11 911 callers that witnessed something that did not 
12 come forward to be interviewed by anybody, anybody's 
13 doing that crosscheck? 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: That would be a good 
15 question for Detective Wilson when he's going to 
16 come and testify close to the end. There are lots 
17 of leads that were followed up that went nowhere. 
18 He would be able to talk about those kind of things 
19 and so I don't want to characterize it and say, yea 
20 or nay. Any of those type of questions he would be 
21 the one to ask.

1 sure when testified earlier this week, 
2 he mentioned there were like 16 or 19 channels, 
3 something like that, that the police officers could 
4 be on. There were a number of channels that the 
5 police officers could be on and in my notes I put 
6 that there are five RIOT channels, there is dispatch 
7 channel, mutual aid channel, the point-to-point 
8 channel and some other channels. 
9 So just because somebody may not be on 
10 here doesn't necessarily mean it might not be on 
11 another one of those channels? 
12 A Correct. Some are receive only, it all 
13 goes back to like --
14 Point-to-point is receive 
15 only.

A That's correct. 2 
3 Q But, for example, where this white car is 
4 in the map on the picture, which wasn't there that 
5 day, this image was not taken that day, but, for 
6 example, you wouldn't be able to see that far from 
7 where you were; is that right? 
A No. 8 
9 Q So what did you see that drew your 
10 attention? 
11 A Well, there were two guys walking down the 
12 street in the middle of street and, uh, police car 
13 passed them, it stopped where they were and they had 
14 conversation or whatever, and so they continued 
15 walking and then the police car backed up to where 
16 they were and I guess had another conversation that 
17 led to an altercation. 
18 After they had an altercation, one of 
19 the guys ran off and the other guy was still there, 
20 and then once he ran from the car, I seen the 
21 officer get out of his car and shoot in his 
22 direction, but that's all I seen.

10 starts. 
11 Q Okay. Now, at this point do you see a

1 apartment, or what did you do? 
2 A See, while it was going on, some people in 
3 my house heard the shots. So my girlfriend came out 
4 and was like, what's somebody shooting for. And she 
5 was like, urn, somebody shooting? I was telling her 
6 the situation and so she was like, is he dead? I 
7 was like, I don't know. Then she was looking at 
8 other people that was around, I guess they thought 
9 that he was dead. So we then walked down there and 
10 was like, and he was laying in the middle of the 
11 street. 
12 Q Did you ever see the officer who shot him, 
13 did you ever see that officer go down by the body? 
14 A Uh, no, I didn't see that. 
15 Q How about did you ever see the officer's 
16 truck, did it ever move? 
17 A No. 
18 Q So after this happened and the police 
19 came, the truck stayed there? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What about the body, other than when 
22 eventually, which I know was a long time, but 
23 eventually it was removed, but did you ever see 
24 anybody try to move the body?

1 Q Okay. Did you ever hear the officer 
2 saying anything or yelling or anything like that? 
3 A No. 
4 Q How about did you ever hear anybody else, 
5 whether it was Mike Brown or the littler guy that 
6 was with him, did you hear anybody saying anything? 
7 A No. 
8 Q And when I ask that, I don't necessarily 
9 mean if you understood what was being said? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
I didn't hear anything. 
You just didn't hear any voices or 
12 screaming or anything? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Okay. And so, obviously, a lot of police 
15 arrived after that; is that right? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And did you stay at the scene while the 
18 police were investigating? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
You didn't go up to the police on that day 
21 and tell them that you saw part of that; is that 
22 right? 
23 A No. 
24 Q And eventually some FBI agents knocked on 
25 your door and asked if you had seen something and

A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is there anything else that you saw that 
7 you think is important or that maybe I haven't asked 
8 you that, let me ask you this, did you ever see 
9 anything in Michael Brown's hands? 
A No. 10 
11 Q How about the littler guy, did you ever 
12 see him hold anything? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Did you ever see anything fall or drop, 
15 being dropped from somebody? 
16 A No. 
17 Q Urn, did you ever see what became of the 
18 littler guy? 
19 A Urn, as the shooting is going on, like he 
20 hid behind the white car and then he tried to get in 
21 the white car, but then I guess they denied him. So 
22 he ran, I think, by then the officer was going 
23 towards Mike Brown. So he ran back behind the 
24 police car and ran behind right here and ran behind 
25 this building.

1 he was getting ready to run towards him, or 
2 whatever, I can't say the motions about. 
3 Q But he had his weapon up? 
4 A Not to say he got up pointing, I just know 
5 he got up and he was facing his direction. So I 
6 guess if he didn't get out like this, he got out, 
7 took a couple steps and then faced him. 
8 Q Well, did you see the officer facing 
9 Mike's back with his weapon drawn? 
10 A No, the officer was getting out of the car 
11 as Mike Brown was running. So once he got past the 
12 building where I couldn't see him no more, the 
13 officer is out of the car and then pointed in his

When were you able to see the officer?

19 during the altercation at the car, did you see a 
20 minivan pull into that parking lot right directly in 
21 front of where you had been sitting and someone get 
22 out of that minivan, or you see anybody pulling out 
23 of that lot during this time? 
24 A I think somebody tried to come that way 
25 and turned around. I remember seeing the white car

1 turn around in the street, but. 
2 Someone coming from that 
3 direction, coming from West Florissant that pulled 
4 into that lot? 
5 A I really can't say. I think it was a 
6 vehicle, I won't say that I know it was. 
7 This is I have a 
8 question about what Sheila was asking. I want to 
9 make sure the first time after the police officer 
10 got out of the car, the first shots that were fired, 
11 you could not see Mike Brown at that time? 
12 A Correct. 
13 So you don't know if his 
14 back was to the officer, you assume he was, he was 
15 running away? 
16 A Right.
