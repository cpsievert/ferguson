4 Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office. All 12 grand 
5 jurors are present this morning, as is the court 
6 reporter, , who is taking down the proceedings 
7 and also audio recording the testimony of witnesses. 
8 Sheila Whirley is here and will be in the room in a 
9 minute, but I wanted to just give you an idea of 
10 what we expect to happen today. 
11 We're getting a late start because as 
12 Roseanne Roseannadanna said, it's always something. 
13 So we had some difficulties this morning that we had 
14 to hammer out and we do have two witnesses here this 
15 morning who are going to testify. 
16 And they will, first one is going to be 
17 He's right out here with Sheila. 
18 He's going to be walking in as soon as I give them 
19 the high sign and he'll, after his testimony is 
20 completed, then we will hear from 
21 If you recall, she made a statement that 
22 was recorded that she made to the County Police, we 
23 heard that yesterday. She also made another 
24 statement to the FBI, which we'll play after we're 
25 done just to give you an opportunity to hear that as

2 And so we also have witnesses lined up for

4 never know if people are going to show up at this 
5 point. People call me and say, I don't think I can 
6 make it now. Well, I call you a cab. So I'm going 
7 to do my best to make good use of your time today. 
8 I've got a couple witnesses who are police 
9 officers or technicians who I've already notified 
10 them to be available if I need to fill a slot if 
11 somebody doesn't show up. So hopefully we'll have 
12 stuff for you for most of the day today, okay. 
13 Does anybody have anything to bring up, 
14 questions before we get started? All right.

5 
A 
Q 
That was gunshots. 
You didn't think maybe it was firecrackers 
6 or anything? 
7 A At first when I first heard, there were 
8 construction workers that happen to have been around 
9 here in front of my apartment. I thought it was 
10 them at first, but after the third and fourth shot, 
11 I realized it was gunshots. I thought they might 
12 have been hammers or something. I realized a hammer 
13 is not going to be that loud, that's when I realized 
14 it was gunshots. 
15 Q So it was louder than you would expect if 
16 it were fireworks?

24 that I live in, and they were scattered between like 
25 the front of this complex and on the side here.

Page 25 
Did you stay on the couch and just look 
2 out the window or did you get up? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
No, I got up and looked out the window. 
So we talking a matter of a second or two 
5 for you to get up and go look out the window? 
6 A Yeah, I would say around 20 to 25 seconds 
7 because at first, I'm sitting there playing the game 
8 when I heard the shots. At first I assumed it was 
9 the construction workers and then I realized it was 
10 gunshots. 
11 At the time when I recognized that it 
12 was gunshots, I had just kind of sort of believed 
13 that someone had just been shooting or shooting up 
14 in the air because I have heard shooting before in 
15 Canfield. So I just sort of assumed that it was 
16 just something going on, but what kind of made me 
17 get up was like everything happened so fast, what 
18 kind of made me get up my mind it is like 12:00 in 
19 the afternoon, why are people shooting this early. 
20 So that made me get up and just look out the window 
21 to see what was going on, that's when I seen him 
22 down. 
23 Q Okay. And so when you, there may have 
24 been 20 to 25 seconds before you actually go out to 
25 go to the window and see him?

17 and he came back forward and he jerked back again 
18 and that's when after that he fell face first on the 
19 ground. 
20 Q Okay. And so what were his arms doing 
21 during this second series of gunshots?

4 did you see him move any more? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
And what did you next see? 
7 A Urn, at this time after he fell on the 
8 ground is when I called my girlfriend. I said, 
9 , someone just got killed out here, someone just 
10 got killed. 
11 At the time I'm thinking, I'm looking 
12 around. This is when I seen the young man run 
13 across the field here and I'm thinking someone just 
14 shot someone else or whatever. And it wasn't until 
15 I seen around three or four officers come from 
16 around the corner of this building is when I 
17 realized okay, that's when I say, the police 
18 just shot someone, the police just shot someone. 
19 Q But that was an assumption you were 
20 making, correct? 
21 A Yes. 
22 Q You didn't see the police officer shoot 
23 anybody?

1 Q Why is it that you would assume the police

3 A Urn, because I felt at this time I wasn't 
4 sure if Mike Brown had a weapon and anger at the 
5 police officer or threatened him, may have caused 
6 the police officer to shoot him. It is just me 
7 assuming that the police officer being that close to 
8 a shooting that fast, that it was conflict between 
9 them. 
10 Q I'm sorry. The fact that there were three 
11 police officers there very quickly, you drew that 
12 conclusion that it was a police officer involved 
13 shooting? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Or is it after when people were coming out 
16 and talking that you then learned that? 
17 A No, it was at that time. Like I said, I 
18 just assumed that it was a police shooting.

20 because you said you saw him run after the shooting,

1 didn't see any officers in pursuit, so that's why I

And is it your belief that she did not see 
6 part of the incident? 
7 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. Why is it that you say that? 
Because her being in the bedroom, I'm not 
10 sure that she got up fast enough to see and look out 
11 the window to see what was going on. 
12 Q So by the time she came out of the bedroom 
13 and came to where you were? 
14 A By the time she came to where I was, the 
15 shooting was over. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Now, I don't believe, she was still 
18 sleeping when all of this was occurring, so I'm not 
19 absolutely sure that she got up at a time when I 
20 first called her name, that she got up and was able 
21 to look out the bedroom window and see anything. 
22 Q But you were sitting with her when you 
23 heard her tell the FBI agents that she did see 
24 Michael Brown get shot? 
25 A Yes.

14 that was?

1 statement of that was taken or done by 
2 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and this 
3 statement is contained on a disc that I have marked 
4 as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 36. 
5 (Deposition Exhibit Number 36 
6 marked for identification.) 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) It is 21 minutes and 56 
8 seconds in length. I have transcripts that I can 
9 pass. 
10 I want to mention during the break 
11 before we began recording again, the grand jurors 
12 had asked if we could try to get a floor plan of the 
13 apartments, and we'll look into that if that can be 
14 done. Also I intend, I'm going to try to get some 
15 testimony from a witness who, as you heard the last 
16 witness, he said that they were interviewed at their 
17 home by federal agents. So it's possible that I 
18 could get one of them who has been inside the 
19 apartment to maybe describe, if we don't have a 
20 floor plan available. 
21 And then also there was a question 
22 about topography, if there was any maybe 
23 topographical maps available. I don't know the 
24 answer to that, but we can see if we can find some. 
25 I also advised the grand jurors that

1 we have had some additional investigation done where 
2 we had officers go out to the scene as recent as 
3 last week and take photographs with a lens that 
4 would be as close to what the human eye sees as we 
5 can get. 
6 In other words, it is not a zoom lens 
7 or anything like that and taking photographs from 
8 different vantage points because I gathered from 
9 some questions that had been asked previously that 
10 this might be a question that you have about, you 
11 know, can somebody be in a certain place and see 
12 what they are describing that they saw. 
13 So I would probably call 
14 to introduce those photos. And as I mentioned 
15 before, if we may have a gap today with witnesses 
16 who might not appear. And so is 
17 standing by ready as one of my fill-in witnesses. 
18 So that might be something that we can get to this 
19 afternoon. 
20 Also, yesterday, we had 
21 talk about taking photographs of Darren Wilson's 
22 face and then we also had him talk about taking 
23 photographs of him taking a bullet out of the side 
24 of one of the buildings.

3 is no witness available, we'll get those photographs

Q 
A 
And after that, where were you employed? 
Then I started with the St. Louis County 
3 Police Crime Lab. 
4 Q How many years have you been with the St. 
5 Louis County Crime Lab? 
6 A One and a half years. 
7 Q And so do you work as a chemist or a 
8 criminalist, but you do work in chemistry and 
9 analysis and chemical compounds for the crime 
10 laboratory? 
11

19 A No. 
20 Q Do you have any certifications or any 
21 other, are there any other requirements that you 
22 received or passed in order to work in the chemistry 
23 county crime lab? 
24 A The county and the Missouri State Highway 
25 Patrol Crime Lab as well are accredited, so I work

1 under an accreditation. 
2 Q All right. And so what, without sounding 
3 too obvious or moronic I would say, could you 
4 describe what chemistry is, the field of forensic 
5 chemistry? 
6 A Forensic chemistry is in the drug 
7 chemistry, we generally it's powders, liquids, 
8 residues, plant material, pharmaceuticals, that we 
9 analyze and determine if they have controlled 
10 substances in them or not. 
11 Q What about other types of things like, for 
12 example, poisons, would you analyze a liquid to 
13 determine if it had any kind of poisonous material? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Not me, no. 
So if say there was a substance that might 
16 be seized in a criminal investigation and it was 
17 suspicious that it was arsonic, is that something 
18 that you would examine and test? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Not me. 
Okay. So your field is strictly regarding 
21 the examination and testing of substances to 
22 determine whether or not they have contained 
23 controlled substances? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And controlled substances are drugs?

Okay. And then everything from 
3 prescription drugs to marijuana, to street drugs; is 
4 that right? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so did you receive an evidence item in 
7 order for you to examine in relation to a St. Louis 
8 County investigation that is hopefully, or will be 
9 documented under Report Number 2014-43984? 
10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What was it that you received to analyze. 
I received a bag that actually I believe 
13 was in a plastic container and then a plastic bag 
14 containing a plant material substance. 
15 Q Okay. In general now, let's talk about 
16 how you get evidence items. How is it that they 
17 come to you? 
18 A They are submitted, in this case since 
19 this is, this is submitted as a county, St. Louis 
20 County case. So it goes through property control 
21 division and then property control brings it up to 
22 the crime lab. 
23 So it gets entered into the computer, 
24 the evidence is then placed into a vault and then --
25 Q A vault in the crime lab?

Yeah. 
Okay. 
And actually, that's normal procedure. 
4 This one, I remember that it went through one of my 
5 co-workers. He was getting ready to work the case 
6 and I asked him, oh, what do you got there? And he 
7 goes, well, this is a case that needs to be worked, 
8 a rush case, do you want to do it? And he asked the

supervisor, I said, that's fine, I can rush this 
case. 
And he said, let me call the 
supervisor and the supervisor said yeah, if 
wants to do the case, that's fine, so I did it. 
Q Now, when you began as a chemist or 
15 forensic chemist with the County Crime Laboratory, 
16 was there like an on-the-job training period or 
17 probationary period? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
And how long did that last? 
Normally it would last six months and 
21 probation is one year, but since I had training 
22 through the Highway Patrol, it really was about two 
23 months here. 
24 Q Okay. And so you were as qualified to 
25 examine this evidence item as any other forensic

7 was described or it was explained to you that this 
8 was something that they needed to have tested ASAP? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
When you said it was rush, did you mean 
11 rush the test or just that it needed? 
12 A We call them rush cases if it needs to be 
13 worked quickly.

15 words, did you go through the testing process faster 
16 than normal?

No, I have my own pace.

Q 
Yes. 
It can be in the normal scheme of things 
22 it could be several weeks or even months before an 
23 evidence item that a police department brings in? 
24 A Yes. We have a backlog so, by meaning 
25 rush, we were putting this case ahead of other cases

2 Q Okay. All right. Did you have, when you 
3 examined or brought out the evidence that was 
4 submitted to you, did it have an evidence sheet with 
5 the evidence?

Q The evidence receipt, we have heard a 
little testimony from Detective and Detective 
12 , who are crime scene investigators, about how 
13 they fill out an evidence receipt or an evidence 
14 sheet when they seize something. And they've 
15 described the chain of custody that must be 
16 completed on the bottom of the sheet. 
17 So looking at the copy of the 
18 evidence receipt that you had with this evidence 
19 item, can you tell from there where this was seized 
20 from? 
21 A Oh, it says that, well, it says who the 
22 officer is and the department, St. Louis County PD. 
23 Q Okay. The officer who seized the 
24 evidence, does it give his name? 
25 A Yes, it does.

1 Q So in this case had you suspected or had 
2 you noticed on the packaging that there, for 
3 example, that the evidence tape appeared to have 
4 been cut open or that there was something odd about 
5 the way the evidence was packaged that we might 
6 suspect that it was tampered with, would you have 
7 noted that in your report? 
8 A I wouldn't note as if, like if there's a 
9 piece of evidence from the officer and then maybe 
10 they had to go back in and reopen somewhere else, 
11 no, I don't note that. 
12 If there was an opening to where it 
13 looks like the evidence could get out of the 
14 container somehow, or to where somebody could put 
15 something in, yes, that would definitely be noted.

1 it was in a plastic container, a baggy in a plastic 
2 container, I can't remember if you said that in here 
3 or you said that out there when we were talking?

5 knotted clear plastic bag containing green 
6 vegetation. I have a note here that says, specimen

8 sealed plastic container. 
9 Q Okay. And that's how it appeared to you 
10 when you first got it; is that right? 
11 A There would also be the outer container as

13 in.

15 you saw a sealed plastic container?

I weigh the substance. 
Do you weigh it in the baggy or remove it

I remove it from the baggy. 
And so when you weigh it, you weigh it on 
7 a digital scale?

9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And are those scales calibrated on a 
10 regular basis to insure their accuracy? 
11 A They're calibrate once a year, they're 
12 checked weekly. 
13 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
They're checked with certified weights. 
So when you weighed the substance that was

17 the baggy, every little leaf and every little--
18 
19 
A 
Q 
As much as I can get out of the bag. 
And according to your report, you had a 
20 weight of 1.589 grams? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Can you describe for me maybe using some 
23 kind of familiar object, is this smaller than a 
24 baseball?

Grand Jury Volume XI 
October 7, 2014 
Page 95 
2 Q After you weigh the amount of the 
3 marijuana and I see down here in your remarks there 
4 is a remark that you include about uncertainty of 
5 measurement. Do you all see that in the, close to 
6 the bottom? What does that mean, the established 
7 uncertainty of measurement due to balance utilized, 
8 what does that mean? 
9 A We take into consideration any kind of 
10 factor that could make the weight slightly different 
11 than the 1.589. We take into consideration things 
12 such as the readability of the scale, the linearity 
13 of the scale, the stability of the scale, the 
14 sensitivity. 
15 And so what we do is over a course of 
16 time we will analyze, we will take our weights that 
17 we normally have with our certified weights. And we 
18 will record, for example, you have a 1 gram weight 
19 and our scale reads out to 1.000. If you get a one 
20 point 1.001, and during your checking we write down 
21 1.001, then that is documented. 
22 Anything that's different than what 
23 the actual weight is, that's considered, there is a 
24 standard deviation involved. Calculating that and 
25 then you find that we come up with this 1.008 for

1 this balance is the most that that scale would ever 
2 be off. 
3 So basically what we are saying here 
4 with this K factor of three, we're saying that 997 
5 times out of 1,000, this weight here of 1.589 will 
6 be right at 1.589 997 times out of a thousand. 
7 Three of those times it might be 
8 1.589? 
9 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Q 
And it could be .0008? 
Correct. 
And that's important especially in cases 
12 with marijuana and other drugs when there might be a 
13 criminal legal implication depending on the weight 
14 of the substance? 
15 A I would like to go back about that weight, 
16 just to make sure that we're clear on that. 
17 It's possible that those three out of 
18 the thousand times could be outside the .008. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
I think I did missay that. Basically 
21 statistics are involved, and we're 95 percent 
22 confident that 99.7 percent of this will be within 
23 the .008 of that weight.

1 circumstances of how much this substance weighed is 
2 really not important or crucial, this isn't a 
3 scenario where we need to have over 35 grams to 
4 charge a certain level of offense. 
5 So let me also ask you, when you 
6 removed the green vegetation from the baggy, did it 
7 appear that it was dry? 
8 
9 
10

It wasn't wet or moist or sticky?

20 believe that's S-I-L-I-C-0-T-I-C. 
21 Q Okay. What are these things that you are 
22 talking about? 
23 A So cystolith hair, it looks like a bear 
24 claw shape, tiny bear claw shape hair. It is 
25 characteristics to marijuana plants.

Okay. And the other thing that you are 
2 looking for, what is that? 
3 A Silicotic, they are more slender like 
4 hair. You may find that more on other substances, 
5 but knowing that's also on a marijuana plant. It is 
6 not as confirming as a cystolith hair.

13 A A cell, it comes out of the surface of the 
14 plant. It is plant cellular material.

18 marijuana now is so much more stronger than it was 
19 back when we were teenagers or whatever. I don't

1 A Yes, waxing is the same as butane hunting 
2 oil. Do you want me to describe that? 
3 Q Yes. 
4 A Okay. So what happens in this scenario is 
5 someone takes the plant material and they will --
6 Q So when you say plant material, it is 
7 marijuana? 
9 You can't do this with your lawn

15 
16 
No. 
I guess you could. 
You could, but you probably won't get THC. 
All right. So we've got some marijuana. 
Yeah, you take marijuana. It is usually 
cylinder that has a hole in the top, a 
17 hole in the bottom. They will take butane, which is 
18 a liquid solvent. 
19 Q Is this just common butane that you can 
20 get like at the hardware store?

Yes.

A 
Q 
A 
Yeah, I would assume so, yeah. 
Okay, all right, go ahead. 
So basically as it goes over the plant, 
5 gravity takes effect and it will absorb the resinous 
6 material, which is concentrated with the THC that 
7 will go out the exit hole and into a pan. So you 
8 have a nice little surface area there and they let 
9 that evaporate off and then you're left with a very 
10 sticky substance, which that is high THC content. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Which is what the last thing 
12 you said about THC. 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Which has a high THC content. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) That's sticky substance, 
15 is it a combination of the butane and the THC that's 
16 been extracted from the marijuana?

Will the butane evaporate off? 
Yes. 
And so is what your left with almost pure 
I don't know for sure. I haven't done 
23 like a quant on that. 
24 Q But it is higher concentration than it 
25 would be in the plant itself?

A 
Q 
Page 103 
Yes, definitely. 
So if you're going to ingest, you know, 
3 smoke a marijuana joint, if you consume the same 
4 amount in that sticky substance, it would be way 
5 more THC than what was in that joint? 
6 A You have taken the volume of plant 
7 material, let's say, the size of this paper and you 
8 are condensing it down to, you are taking the 
9 cannabinoids and you are condensing it down without 
10 the plant material matrix and all those steps. 
11 Q Okay. This process that you talked about, 
12 is this something like anybody could do if they have 
13 the marijuana and then the right materials?

And then why do people do this process? 
I'm not really sure. 
Okay. If someone, do you know how they 
18 then will consume or ingest the sticky substance 
19 that they've gotten? 
20 A This is pure assumption, but I assume it 
21 is just like marijuana, marijuana is commonly smoked 
22 and marijuana can be ingested. And there are also 
23 those food items that contain marijuana that they 
24 come from Colorado and so forth.

1 the butane hunting oil to put it in those substances 
2 so it doesn't look like there is plant material in 
3 there. 
4 I've also heard of lollipops that 
5 have THC on them. I would assume it would have to 
6 come from butane hunting oil, not marijuana. They 
7 can't put the marijuana plant in lollipops.

9 ingesting this, you are calling it hunting oil?

Butane hunting oil. You have heard of 
12 people ingesting that, correct? 
13 
14

Q 
Heard of it. 
If one were to ingest that, you would be

1 there be like a scent or something like coming from 
2 their body, within their skin. You know how you can 
3 tell a person is smoking because it is in their skin 
4 cells, but could you detect that? 
5 A This is getting out of my expertise, but I 
6 have heard that officers are trained to, they know 
7 what the smell of marijuana, I've been around 
8 marijuana. I know the smell of marijuana myself. 
9 As far as what to look for on a 
10 person, I mean, I've heard of like bloodshot eyes, I 
11 haven't heard anything about the skin, there 
12 probably is, there are probably some things out

3 mentioned that the normal procedure that it comes to 
4 an intake person and then goes to the vault and it

Is that because the rush 
12 was put on it, is that the only reason it didn't go

And on the scale, I just 
2 want some clarification, you said the most it could 
3 be off was 0.008 grams and that's, but then you went 
4 back and you said, that it could be outside of that 
5 amount three times out of a thousand. 
6 A Yes. 
7 You do try to error on 
8 the side of caution, but there is always three out 
9 of a thousand could be incorrect? 
10 A Consider the way this was calculated when 
11 we determine that we were going to put a K factor of 
12 three on it, there's common K factors of two and 
13 three. And two is, would be 99 point, I think it is 
14 maybe 97 percent. I'm not real sure on that but I 
15 do know that K three is higher up, so it is 99.7. 
16 So we're saying statistically we are 
17 95 percent confident that 997 out of a thousand 
18 times that if you were to weigh this substance that 
19 many times it would be within .008 grams of that 
20 actual number we have. 
21 Of the weight that you

1 you were getting at, I neglected to 
2 ask you this, when you looked at this evidence item 
3 that you were testing, can you test marijuana to see 
4 if there's butane on it? 
5 A I don't think that there's any good way of 
6 testing that. My assumption, and this is just 
7 purely assumption, since butane would be a liquid, 
8 it would be wet, but I think it would be evaporated 
9 off at that point. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: You don't test for it in 
11 your lab? 
12 A We don't normally test for it. Butane 
13 could be tested on instrumentation. I don't have a 
14 procedure, it's never been presented to me to test 
15 for it.

17 didn't test this substance to see if it had butane

2 I am going to 
3 ask if it did have butane on it, there would either 
4 be a sticky substance to the bag, it would be wet, 
5 there would be some sort of sticky substance at the 
6 bottom of the bag, but because it was dry and it was 
7 not wet, you determined just from the appearance of 
8 it that it would not be butane in it?

10

14 Q What does AFIS do, I mean, tell us a 
15 little bit about AFIS? 
16 A Bottom line is, when a person is 
17 fingerprinted, those prints are put into the AFIS 
18 system. And then it would be my job to search those 
19 prints to see if I can find a match through the AFIS 
20 system. 
21 Q Okay. What technical equipment, if any, 
22 do you use in your job in doing your latent 
23 fingerprint examination? 
24 A With the AFIS, with the AFIS system 
25 basically I use magnifying glasses.

1 Q So a lot of us we watch CSI and other 
2 programs, and we believe that computers somehow 
3 generate prints and tell us when there's a match and 
4 you see all of these numbers. You've seen these 
5 programs, is that the way it is really done? 
6 A Partially yes, partially no. 
7 Q Okay, tell us about it? 
8 A Urn, when I search a print, the AFIS system 
9 searches the print itself and then it gives me a 
10 candidate list. Of the candidate list, the computer 
11 is saying, for instance, if it comes back with 20 
12 candidates. The computer says this is the closest 
13 thing that we have to what you just searched. And 
14 it is up to me to go into each candidate and do a 
15 one-to-one comparison to see if it is or is not a 
16 match. 
17 So the bottom line is, the computer 
18 does not tell you it's a match, it just gives you a 
19 candidate list. It is up to the individual person 
20 to say this is a match or it is not a match. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
How do you determine if it is a match? 
I check for the minutia points in each 
23 fingerprint. Minutia points or bifurcation, 
24 bifurcation, any ridges, ridge dots, ridge islands. 
25 And arrangement of these minutia points and each

1 fingerprint is what makes the fingerprint unique to 
2 each person. 
3 Q And unlike DNA, which identical twins can 
4 have the same DNA, correct? I mean, to your 
5 knowledge? 
6 A To my knowledge, yes. 
7 Q Right, I mean, that's kind of common 
8 knowledge, not that we know DNA here, but can two 
9 people have the same fingerprint? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. And when you talk about the minutia 
12 points, are there a number of points you are looking 
13 for in making an identification of a fingerprint? 
14 A The St. Louis County Police Department, we 
15 have a standard of eight or more points. So 
16 basically what that means is, if I get a partial 
17 fingerprint on whatever I'm looking at, if I can 
18 only find seven or less of these points, we deem 
19 that print insufficient. It has to have eight or 
20 more for us to say it is good evidence and then we 
21 go to the next step. 
22 Q Okay. Any idea how many times you've made 
23 a fingerprint identification? I know I didn't tell 
24 you to look for that information, but do you have 
25 ever a conservative number, have you ever thought

More than 100? 
Probably hundreds of thousands for the 
5 last 21 years, yes. 
6 Q Do you do palm prints also? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And tell us a little bit about palm print 
9 identification, how do you do that? 
10 A Palm prints are the exact same thing as 
11 fingers. Your palms are as unique as your fingers. 
12 And actually, so also is the bottom of your toes and 
13 the soles of your feet have the same friction ridges 
14 and they're as unique as the your palms and your 
15 fingers. 
16 Q Is it possible, like for you, right there 
17 to sit there and touch every surface of that little 
18 table or desk like thing you are sitting at, and not 
19 leave fingerprints? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, it is. 
And how is that possible? 
There are several factors. The first 
23 factor is the person himself. Some people secrete 
24 their perspiration. What I mean by that, on your 
25 friction ridges you have pores. And you secrete

Page 117 
1 your perspiration through your pores and it coats 
2 your ridges. So when you touch something, you could 
3 leave your print behind by that means. 
4 Some people don't secrete that much, 
5 so they don't have enough moisture on their fingers 
6 or palms when they do touch something to leave 
7 something behind. 
8 The other factors are the surface 
9 itself. Some surfaces are not good to get 
10 fingerprints off of. Another factor would be the 
11 weather. If I was processing these glasses and 
12 they've been sitting outside for the last week or 
13 two or three, any type of weather condition, rain, 
14 snow, heat, cold could possibly destroy a print that 
15 was left on there. 
16 Q And so fingerprints are transferred from 
17 the person to the item. It has to do with the 
18 moisture in there, on their skin? 
A Yes. 19 
20 Q And some people, like who have very dry 
21 skin may not leave a print? 
A Yes, that's correct. 22 
23 Q Okay. So tell us how you compare 
24 fingerprints, a latent print with an ink print, how 
25 does that work?

1 A I do a side-by-side with the aid of an 
2 magnifying glass and I'm checking for the minutia 
3 points, I'm checking for the quality of the minutia 
4 points and I just find a specific area to start from 
5 and just do my comparison from there.

1 Q In what cases, like what type of cases 
2 would you be checking a deceased fingerprints? 
3 A On deceased prints is usually, you know, a 
4 homicide or suspicious death or a person that is 
5 found dead, they do not know their identity and they 
6 take their prints and then we check them through the 
7 system to see if we can find who they are.

9 fingerprints the deceased?

1 Q So what were you told to check for prints 
2 on? 
3 A Well, when I received the envelope the 
4 first thing I do is I check each latent lift, and as 
5 I spoke of earlier, I check to see if each, if the 
6 latent print, if there is any good latent prints on 
7 the lift, if it is has eight or more points. 
8 In the second, if I do find a print 
9 that is good, then I will check if we have any 
10 victim eliminations. I would see if it is the 
11 victim's prints or not. If there is any suspects in 
12 the case, if they have something listed as a 
13 suspect. If we have him on file, then I'll pull his 
14 prints and check them against the good print.

13 bottom of a cup, turn on the Super Glue machine. 
14 The fumes from the Super Glue will adhere to any

MS. WHIRLEY: Questions? 
10 So these 
11 tests, you talked a little bit maybe about the life 
12 expectancy of the print. If it is not identified as 
13 Darren or Michael Brown, how long or how much 
14 earlier do you think those would have lasted? Say 
15 it would have happened that morning, would it be 
16 something from a previous day or any thoughts if 
17 those are not those two prints, when those might 
18 have been put there, any idea? 
19 A Really, no idea. On cars it is very 
20 difficult because, and I don't know how the Ferguson 
21 Police Department, how they, how their cars, how 
22 many guys go in and out of their cars or if they 
23 share their cars. It is kind of difficult to say.

10 have any reason to suspect, but as Dorian Johnson 
11 was present, do we have the ability to test for his 
12 prints to see if those are his? Maybe that's not a 
13 question for you. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Dorian Johnson, was he 
15 tested against? 
16 A I was not given that name to check. 
17 Thank you. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: 
19 Would his prints be in 
20 AFIS if he had been arrested at some point? 
21 A Yes, they would. There is something on 
22 the AFIS system, the AFIS system is not perfect. It 
23 is only about a 65 percent hit rate. So, in other 
24 words, I'm in the AFIS system. If I leave my print 
25 behind and I search that print, 65 percent of time

1 it is going to hit and 35 percent it is not going to 
2 hit. The factors that come into play, and the 
3 biggest factor, the two biggest factors of that is 
4 quality of the latent print. 
5 If I touch something on my tip and I 
6 leave enough minutia points of eight or more in 
7 order for that to be a good print and I search that, 
8 now when I got fingerprinted. They may not have 
9 fingerprinted my tip. So that tip may not be in 
10 there. So there's factors that do come into play. 
11 The bottom line is, the system is not 
12 perfect. Just because the person is in the system 
13 and I search a print knowing, if I know that person 
14 is in the system, it still may not hit. 
15 The 
16 only way to say whether or not these two that were 
17 evidence, could be, that were real good prints, but 
18 not Michael Brown's, to see if those were Dorian 
19 Johnson's would be to fingerprint him? 
20 
21 
A That is correct, to check his prints. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Or if you had a card, you 
22 would just need to look at it visually. You could 
23 not count on AFIS?

A Correct.

MS. ALIZADEH: This October 7th at 
6 3:21 p.m. I'm present, as well as Sheila Whirley, 
7 and 12 grand jurors are present, as well as 
8 the court reporter. And we've had a little break 
9 and I just want to put on the record that during the 
10 break there was some discussion, but it was 
11 primarily about logistics and scheduling and 
12 planning. There was really nothing discussed that 
13 had to do with any substance of the case and the 
14 evidence that has been presented. 
15 Would you all agree with that, we didn't 
16 talk about the evidence? 
17 (All indicate yes.) 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So for now we are going to 
19 resume this afternoon and we would first start off 
20 by playing a statement by a witness named 
21 I expect that she will be here a little 
22 later this afternoon. And this is a statement that 
23 made to County Police officers on August 13th, 
24 and the statement is recorded and contained on Grand 
25 Jury Exhibit Number 24.

12 anybody need to hear that or a portion of it over 
13 again? I really, as you all notice it was, I would 
14 say poor quality recording. Difficult to hear at

17 review that again, you have difficulty hearing that,

19 And now we're going to play another 
20 recorded statement for you. And this is the

22 was done on August 13th and it is about 21 minutes,

21 at 4:00 says that she, she missed the cab, so we 
22 sent the cab back for her. I don't know if she's

MS. ALIZADEH: And, again, the grand

18 going down, but then when I talked to my fiancee he 
19 said it was actually gunshots, and like he shot him 
20 two more times. That's when the guy tipped over.

10 A That could possibly be true. Because I'm 
11 trying to see what's going on in the streets, but at

1 Q Did it appear someone was in the car, you

3 A I kind of figured it was someone in the

7 strange to you? 
8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Why not? 
Because I figure that he either was

12 him. 
13 Q Okay. So you didn't see anything that 
14 looked aggressive like fighting or tussling or 
15 anything like that? 
16 A Well because of the gunshots I thought 
17 that he was either shooting at the cop or something 
18 was going on or something might have been going on 
19 around in the area. So I just, when I first seen 
20 the police car and after hearing the shots I was 
21 like kind of leery about going any further.

7 there and then he kind of, urn, started backing away 
8 from it and stuff at first. I thought he slung 
9 something away, but I couldn't be sure if that's 
10 what I saw right now.

Q 
Okay. 
Because I couldn't remember that. 
When you heard the shot, was he still

15 A I'm not exactly sure because like I said, 
16 we heard the shots. I heard the shots when we were 
17 like about right, when we was coming around the bend 
18 around that corner. I didn't hear anything when I 
19 actually got a visual of what was going, you know, 
20 people standing there.

1 Q Okay. So when you see him running, is he 
2 firing a weapon at that time, you say his gun is 
3 out, the police officer, is he firing at the 
4 individual running? 
5 A No, he couldn't, if he was running with it 
6 down by his side down. 
7 Q Well, at any time did he change that 
8 position and start firing? 
9 A He didn't start, I didn't see him fire, I 
10 didn't even hear the gunshots until later. 
11 Q And what was happening when you heard the 
12 gunshots? 
13 A When I heard the gunshots and saw him 
14 firing his weapon, he was, Michael had stopped, he 
15 had stopped. He threw his hands up and then he put 
16 his hands down, Michael turned around and then he 
17 started running, he kind of shuffled back and forth 
18 a little bit like he was confused or something. And 
19 then he started running towards my car, he started 
20 running back towards us. 
21 The officer had ran, he was running 
22 after him. He had stopped, I heard him say get down 
23 about two or three times and he kind of veered off 
24 to the side a little bit, but he still was aiming 
25 his gun at the guy, at Michael. And he after, he

1 held his gun out at him, he was aiming the gun at 
2 him, he was telling him to get down. And like I 
3 said, Michael was shuffling back and forth like he 
4 was confused and then he started running and that's 
5 when I started hearing him shoot. 
6 Q While he was running toward the officer? 
7 A Kind of towards the officer. I couldn't 
8 be sure if he was running exactly towards the 
9 officer or just trying to run past him. 
10 Q But he was running in the officer's 
11 direction? 
12 A He was running pretty much our direction.

I couldn't be sure if he was trying to

1 A Well, like I say, I couldn't be sure if he 
2 was trying to threaten him, like I said. 
3 Q I mean, a person, a reasonable person just 
4 looking at it, would you think in your mind? 
5 A I thought he was trying to charge him at 
6 first because the only thing I kept saying was is he 
7 crazy? Why don't he just stop instead of running 
8 because if somebody is pulling a gun on you, first 
9 thing I would think is to drop down on the ground 
10 and not try to look like I'm going to attack 'em, 
11 but that was my opinion. 
12 Q So it looked to you like he could be 
13 attacking him? 
14 A He looked like, he looked like he could 
15 have been attacking him or the officer could have 
16 felt like he was attacking him. 
17 Q I want you to tell me what your impression 
18 was as you looked at it? 
19 A I was looking at it, I could not be sure. 
20 Like I said the officer, he was like off to the side 
21 a little bit and Michael was probably, he was like 
22 standing here shuffling back and forth, and he took, 
23 he just started running. I don't know if he was 
24 trying to come towards the officer or if he was just 
25 trying to run past him.

4 I'll turn it over. When you talked about him having 
5 his hands up, at what point did he have his hands 
6 up? 
7 A He put his hands up when he stopped. He 
8 kind of like threw his hands up, like I can't do 
9 this no more. He just threw his hands up and he 
10 turned around and he kind of put his hands down and 
11 he was like shuffling. He didn't have his arms up 
12 while he was shuffling, he was just shuffling back 
13 and forth.

3 radioing. I seen him grab like the radio on his

5 decided it was time for me to turn around. 
6 Q Okay. So you left at that point? 
7 A I was trying to, but it was like two 
8 police SUVs started coming past me after that. They 
9 was coming down the street. I was looking to make 
10 sure there wasn't anybody coming around me. So I 
11 was trying, because I had my family in the car, I 
12 didn't want to get hit by anything, so I was 
13 watching. I looked in the side mirror to see if 
14 anybody was coming and I seen the two police SUVs 
15 coming, and I stopped. And after they passed by, I 
16 watched a little longer and I went around. 
17 I went up this driveway right here

I don't have an opinion about that because
