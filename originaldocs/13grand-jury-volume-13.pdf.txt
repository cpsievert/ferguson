4 A I saw Michael punching a couple times 
5 through the window, I would say a few times. 
6 Q Okay. And did you ever see the officer 
7 punching Michael?

9 and stuff and the officer hand disappeared, I saw

Did it look like one person was winning

13 struggle or was it even? 
14 A I really can't answer that because like it 
15 was happening so fast. And like I told you, you 
16 know, if I can't tell the story right away, 
17 sometimes I forget things, you know, so I don't want 
18 to put that, but as far as I could tell, you know, 
19 like Michael hit him a few times. He had ahold of 
20 Mike real close through the window and the officer, 
21 both of them struggle to hit one another. 
22 And I see Michael hit him a couple

3 got out of his truck and the officer had his gun 
4 down to his side like that. Looked like the officer 
5 was reaching up to his thing he had on his shirt

6 car. It was pretty quick, you know what I'm saying? 
7 I couldn't say he sit there a long time, it was 
8 pretty quick he got out of his car. 
9 Q Okay. I'm just guessing, you tell me if 
10 I'm wrong. So if Michael Brown started running. 
11 A Right. 
12 Q By the time the officer got out of his 
13 car, Michael Brown had a little bit of a head start? 
14 A He wasn't that far away from him as far as

14 was brown or gold or something like that, as far as 
15 I can recall.

It was because of your ? 
Right, right, and then I went to talk to 
23 them then because I didn't want to get involved and 
24 they gave me a subpoena to come down there to talk

1 you know what I'm saying? So I called my lawyer and 
2 asked him, you know, could they do that, you know. 
3 I said, man, I'm here to mind my own business just 
4 trying to enjoy my life, you know what I'm saying? 
5 I want to live what I got left. He said, yes, you 
6 got to go, he said instead of going, he called the 
7 officer and I don't know if he called the officer or 
8 the officer called them so he could meet with them. 
9 So we met with them and talked to them and then I 
10 didn't have to go to this thing here, right. So we 
11 met them the day before or two days before, I'm not 
12 for sure. 
13 Q Let's go back just to clarify. You 
14 actually were given a subpoena to testify in a

Yeah, I was driving. 
And here is the subpoena? 
Right. They want something that I didn't 
4 really care for, they said, you come down here of 
5 your own free will. No, I didn't come on my own 
6 free will, I came because you told me I had to, you 
7 know what I'm saying? 
8 Q So once you got the subpoena, you talked 
9 to your attorney and your attorney arranged for you 
10 to come in and be interviewed? 
11 A He said he would be there with me because 
12 like, like you say, I don't trust the police to sit 
13 there and talk to them. There's some type of way, 
14 you know, I don't use all my words right like most 
15 people, but, you know, like they take what I say and 
16 twist it towards me, you know, like ever since then, 
17 I just haven't been comfortable. 
18 Q Okay. So that's how you ended up making a 
19 statement to federal agents is because your attorney 
20 worked it out that you could come in and be 
21 interviewed rather than testify, right? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's right. 
And now you know that I had you served 
24 with a subpoena to come here today, right? 
25 A Okay, uh-huh.

5 A I don't think there was a struggle for the 
6 gun that I could tell. 
7 Q Okay. All right, questions? 
8 You 
9 had mentioned before when you first say, you said 
10 that the officer had the gun in his right hand? 
11 A Yes, ma'am. 
12 When he's out of the 
13 vehicle? 
14 A Right. 
15 He had his gun in his 
16 right hand, his hand is down by his side, by his 
17 right side. 
18 A Right, uh-huh. 
19 And the gun is pointed, I 
20 guess, basically towards the ground? 
A Right. 21 
22 
23 
Is that correct? 
A Right. 
24 And then you made a motion 
25 that he spoke into his shoulder mike?

3 Did you 
4 see any cars lined up behind the police vehicle 
5 coming the opposite direction other than the one he 
6 put his hand on? 
7 A To tell the truth, I really can't say I 
8 did. I don't remember. On the car I was paying 
9 attention to was the one he had his hands on. I 
10 thought the kid was hit, I thought Michael Brown was 
11 hit, you know. I told Mr. I said that kid 
12 must have got hit, you know. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Anything else? 
14 Why do you 
15 think, a couple questions, my first question for 
16 you. When Michael Brown was walking towards the 
17 officer, how would you describe that. You showed us 
18 he was walking, how would you kind of describe, was 
19 he walking aggressively, did he seem to be charging 
20 in any sort of manner, was he just casually walking, 
21 how would you describe his movement toward the 
22 officer? 
23 A Well, I can't say it was aggressive, but 
24 you know, what I could not understand, you know 
25 like, well, good God, after he got hit fall, he just

3 keep your hands clear or lay down on the ground or 
4 something, you know what I'm saying?

12 reach in his pants as if he is going for a weapon? 
13 
14 
15 
A No, I didn't. 
MS. WHIRLEY: All right. 
16 It is about the timeframe, the amount of time that 
17 you said that this all took place. I do this too, I 
18 will say a minute or two. A minute or two is kind 
19 of long. 
20 A Yes, uh-huh. 
21 So do you think that 
22 Michael Brown was behind that car holding on for a 
23 full minute or two, or do you think you were just 
24 doing that to describe, you know, like a minute is, 
25 the police officer would have plenty of time to get

3 really say, but you know, I say a minute or two

7 I'm saying?

9 A I say a minute or two, that's the best of 
10 my knowledge.

12 recorded statement, they have asked you what was 
13 going through your mind and what was happening as 
14 you were turning around. And you said it just blows 
15 your mind. What blows your mind. And you said, it 
16 blew my mind because like I couldn't believe, you 
17 know, like this ain't happening, why are people 
18 tussling with the police, just talk to them, you 
19 know. 
20 So do you believe that if he would have 
21 stopped and gotten on the ground, do you believe 
22 that things would have turned out differently or do 
23 you believe that it still would --
24 A I believe it would have turned out 
25 differently as most people, when the police stop

6 get some clarification on something. You had let me

8 Michael is down the street, he is, hands on the back 
9 of the brown car and he's actually facing the 
10 officer still at that time, okay. 
11 A Uh-huh 
12 You see him come away from 
13 the back of the car? 
14 
15 
A Uh-huh. 
And his hands are down by 
16 his side, is that the correct stance? 
17 A As far as I can tell, I couldn't swear on 
18 they were down by his side. It looked, you know, to 
19 me like when he took his hand, you first take your 
20 hand off the car, you know, you're standing. He 
21 took a step and that's when everything just sped up. 
22 Okay. And you see him at 
23 that time, he said it appeared to you that he took 
24 maybe about two or three steps forward?

22 out the back because the back was just the sidewalk

3 encounter the other police cars?

6 Coming in past you? 
7 A Yes, ma'am.

2 Would that be the reason 
3 why you couldn't have seen that happen? 
4 A Oh, yeah, it could be because my back's

7 that to talk to the officer, you know what I'm 
8 saying? But you know for some reason, he just don't 
9 want to talk to them, you know. 
10 I did get him to call one of the 
11 officers because the officer asked me to tell him to 
12 call him because he kept telling me to tell him to 
13 call him if I saw him. The last two times I saw him 
14 I told him, I say, man, why don't you call these 
15 people so they will leave me alone, you know what

8 Do you think that would 
9 change the way he was thinking? 
10 A You saying if somebody else would have 
11 been at the police? 
12 No, no, no. I'm saying 
13 since he was a police officer, do you think that 
14 would have made him more afraid of the person coming 
15 toward him was because he was a police officer?

19 that mean

He was one of my cousin's

11 to find out that was my cousin. 
12 Okay. So you are actually a 
13 blood relative of Mike Brown. 
14 MR. Yeah. 
15 But you didn't know that 
16 until after he was killed? 
17 I didn't know until after. 
18 After my cousin popped over there and that's when I 
19 found out that. 
20 Okay. But you basically saw 
21 him every day?

1 MR. That's, that's like a friend 
2 of the family. I knew him and all his brothers and 
3 sisters and all that so. 
4 He's actually a blood cousin 
5 also, is that right, Dorian? 
6 MR. He's not blood, but we grew 
7 up around each other, so to me it is blood. 
8 I thought before you 
9 described it as a blood cousin, but he was basically 
10 kind of a friend of the family? 
11 
12 
MR. Yeah. 
Okay, all right. Can you 
13 just tell us basically what you saw on August 9th 
14 when Michael Brown was killed? 
15 MR. The day of it happening, it 
16 was around 4:00 in the morning. I was on the phone 
17 with a lady friend of mine and something came over 
18 my body and I felt, I didn't feel right. I was like 
19 something was going to happen. And Mike, he's on 
20 the couch right next to me, so he just told me to go 
21 to sleep, nothing going to happen, that's all right. 
22 So in the morning, the reason why we woke 
23 up was because my mother called and was like, she 
24 needed me to help her put my nephews in the car for 
25 her and my sister. So I was asleep at that point, I

1 didn't feel like getting up. Michael Brown put my 
2 nephews in the car for me and everything. 
3 And he can use my phone cause I told him 
4 to call his grandmother to make sure she's okay 
5 before you do anything cause he wasn't talking to 
6 her because they had a little dispute the day 
7 before. So I told him to call her and make sure 
8 He had a dispute with his 
9 grandmother? 
10 MR. Yeah, you know, just her 
11 telling, you know how it is with family. 
12 Do you know what the dispute 
13 was about? 
14 MR. No, sometimes just have, you 
15 know, families have little arguments from time to 
16 time. So I guess it was a little argument and she 
17 went to the hospital that day. So he was staying 
18 with me for that week. 
19 Was he staying with you 
20 because she was in the hospital or because of this 
21 dispute?

20 what was going on. 
21 So that first shot actually 
22 woke you up? 
23 MR. Yeah, the first shot 
24 actually woke me up. I wasn't in no deep, deep

6 And you actually personally 
7 saw this?

9 his knees with his hands in the air? 
10 Okay. And then what 
11 happened? 
12 MR. And then I say maybe about a 
13 few seconds later, I looked and I was still looking 
14 out the window and I seen him shoot him in the head. 
15 By the time I tried to get out of the house, like by 
16 the time I hit the stairs, I heard four more shots 
17 go off. 
18 And then I live all the way on the third 
19 floor, so I say when I first came out of the house, 
20 I heard the four gunshots and then by the time I got

18 I found out it was him because I knew everything he 
19 had on because he was just at my house 20 minutes 
20 prior to what happened.

11 MR.

Okay. 
I can't tell you what he did 
13 I can tell you that the 
14 evidence was that he had smoked weed or basically 
15 THC somehow that day, all right, that's the 
16 ingredient in weed or marijuana. The two of you had 
17 smoked before, I'm just curious about, when you were 
18 up overnight, did he smoke at that time maybe? 
19 MR. Neither one of us smoked 
20 that day. Neither one of us had no money. 
Okay. 21 
22 MR. Well, I didn't have no money

11 MR. No, he just said he was 
12 going to walk to the store and he'd be back, him and 
13 Dorian. 
14 Let's talk about that. My 
15 understanding is he was going to the store to get 
16 some Cigarillos. Did he tell you that he was going 
17 there to get those? 
18 MR. No, but I wasn't sure if he 
19 had it already or that he was going to go get it or

13 that Dorian hid behind the white Monte Carlo? 
14 He told me, he told me that 
15 it was like he was telling everybody. Like he 
16 didn't have no choice but to try and run and hide 
17 behind the Monte Carlo while the shooting was 
18 occurring. We haven't had a chance to talk. 
19 So was he able to see the 
20 shooting then while he was hiding behind the Monte 
21 Carlo. 
22 That's what he said, I 
23 haven't talked to him. 
24 Okay. Have you seen any of 
25 the media coverage of this?

3 Okay. You mentioned before 
4 you saw Dorian giving statements on CNN and MSNBC? 
5 Yeah. 
6 Do you recall that?

8 actually said, people was just telling me and I saw 
9 a YouTube clip of it of him on TV. 
10 Do you know what people were 
11 talking? 
12 Like my mother and like 
13 people was just talking, he was on TV. 
14 Now, , I've got to be 
15 honest with you, okay. I mean, based on what you 
16 are telling me today, it is substantially different 
17 than what you told the FBI before, okay. You talked 
18 about seeing one shot to the head before and then 
19 you talked about seeing the police officer stand 
20 over Mike Brown and shoot four more times into his 
21 body, do you recall that? 
22 Yeah. 
23 Did you see that or did you 
24 not?

3 into Michael Brown? 
4 I didn't actually see it

6 Okay. 
7 But his 
8 That's why we need to clarify 
9 what you actually saw versus these things that you 
10 assume or what you think you heard because it is 
11 important. 
12 It is not assuming if I'm 
13 going down the steps and I hear boom, boom, boom, 
14 but ain't nobody else out there got hit. Ain't no 
15 one else out there injured. That is just common 
16 sense. 
17 Back when you talked to the 
18 FBI previously, that was on August 13th, okay, just 
19 a few days after this happened, about four days 
20 after this happened. You told them that after the 
21 officer shot Brown in the head, he shot him eight 
22 more times. 
23 Yeah. 
24 And you said that you saw 
25 him fire four more shots into Mike Brown's body as

5 Today you are telling me you

10 hear them? 
11 I didn't see them, but I 
12 heard them on my way running downstairs. 
13 You said there was a 10 
14 second pause and more shots? 
15 Yes. 
16 Okay. We're talking about 
17 now and then a total of ten shots is what you were 
18 talking about? 
19 Yes. 
20 So as you sit here today, 
21 how many shots did you actually see. 
22 I saw one, but heard nine. 
23 Okay. So you are saying 
24 today that you just saw one shot?

2 On August 13th when you said 
3 that the police officer stood over him and shot him 
4 four more times, you didn't actually see that; is 
5 that right? 
6 Yes. 
7 Okay. You told me today 
8 that you actually didn't see any injuries to Michael 
9 Brown before the shot to the head; is that right? 
10 Yeah. 
11 You didn't see any bleeding 
12 or wounds or anything like that. 
13 I couldn't see because his 
14 back was turned towards that way. 
15 Okay. See, that's a problem 
16 I have today is that back on August 13th you told 
17 the FBI that Mr. Brown had blood flowing from his 
18 shoulder or rib cage on his left side. Did you 
19 actually not see that? 
20 I didn't see exactly where 
21 he got shot at. I said, I knew he had got shot I 
22 heard the first shot cause he stopped and he was 
23 sitting in the middle of the street. Like I told 
24 you, with his hands in the air.

2 injuries to Michael Brown when he was down on his

4 that he had blood flowing from his shoulder and rib

6 do you recall that? 
7 Yes. 
8 Did you all actually see 
9 that or not? 
10 No, I didn't actually see. 
11 Okay. So when you told the 
12 FBI that on August 13th, you actually did not see 
13 that? 
14 That was something that I 
15 heard. That's why you told me to tell you what I 
16 actually saw, so I'm telling you what I actually 
17 saw. Someone in the community--
Who was that? 
Who told you? 
18

4 That's what people were

8 Okay. As you sit here today 
9 then, you actually did not see blood flowing from 
10 his shoulder or rib cage before he was shot in the

2 Yes.

4 that the police officer was basically standing right 
5 in front of him when he shot him; is that right? 
6 Yes, his gun was close to 
7 him. 
8 His gun almost touching his 
9 head? 
10 Not almost touching, I said 
11 like that far away, but it was point blank range. 
12 (inaudible) 
13 You've described it as very 
14 close or point blank range? 
15 Point blank range. 
16 Basically the police 
17 officer, from what you described before, he just got 
18 out of his car and walked over to Mike Brown and 
19 shot him in the head? 
20 I didn't see any of it. 
21 You didn't see the police 
22 officer get out of the car? 
23 I didn't see it.

8 before that the officer shot Brown in the head as 
9 soon as he exited the police truck. You saying 
10 today you didn't see the police officer exit the 
11 truck? 
12 I didn't see him get out of 
13 no truck. His police cruiser was a couple of feet 
14 going up towards West Florissant. 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 But I didn't see him get out 
17 of no truck. 
18 Okay. So when you looked 
19 out there on August 9th, the police officer is 
20 already out of the truck? 
21 Yes. 
22 And was standing in front of 
23 Mike Brown?

1 in the head? 
2 Yeah. 
3 While Mike Brown was

5 Yeah. 
6 Again, the officer is very 
7 close, basically point blank range at the time of 
8 the shot? 
9 Yes. 
10 I think you said before too 
11 they were basically right next to the police car at 
12 that time the; is that right? 
13 It was not right next, but 
14 it was enough to where I could see the police 
15 cruiser. 
16 I think before you said it 
17 was probably five or six feet away? 
18 Yeah, It wasn't too far, it 
19 was down toward like West Florissant. 
20 He was actually moving; is 
21 that right? 
22 Yeah, he was moving, he was 
23 facing towards West Florissant. 
24 At the time that the police

4 Okay. And you say today 
5 that Mr. Brown, when he was shot in the head, he 
6 dropped to the ground flat on his face? 
7 Yeah. 
8 Basically facedown? 
9 Basically, yeah. 
10 Do you recall on 
11 August 13th, it is another concern I have okay, and 
12 I'm just being honest with you, okay? 
13 All right. 
14 Is it at that time you said 
15 you he fell on his side. You said he fell on his 
16 side and the police officer shot him four more times 
17 in the side. 
18 That's what I heard. 
19 Okay. Who did you hear that 
20 from?

1 stories. But I will tell you from what I seen, from 
2 what I seen, what I seen he dropped and I heard more 
3 shots as I was going downstairs. 
4 So basically you didn't see 
5 Michael Brown when he turned or dropped to the 
6 ground, you didn't see him turn on his side? 
7 
8 
9 
No. 
You didn't see that? 
No. When I got down to the 
10 end of the steps, he was facedown. 
11 Okay. All right. So you 
12 never saw him turned on his side? 
13 No, when I got down he was 
14 facedown and blood was rushing from his head out in 
15 the street. 
16 And just to be clear here, 
17 then you didn't see the police officer stand over 
18 him and fire four more shots into his body? 
19 Obviously, I didn't see him, 
20 I heard eight more shots after the two gunshots from 
21 inside the house. 
22 Let me ask you this 
23 and again, I just want to be upfront here. Are you 
24 sure that you saw the police officer fire any shots

4 because beforehand you told us what you saw that you 
5 saw and now you came in here and say you actually

3 everything that you said on August 13th, and much of

12 have, okay.

6 see Michael Brown shot if you didn't, would you lie

8 Just listen to me. There is 
9 not no thought if I know for a fact 
10 Can I explain generalities of 
11 forensics. Not discussing, we're not here to 
12 discuss or argue about it. But everything we 
13 measure against every testimony here is what we know 
14 to be forensics because that is irrefutable. 
15 It is not he was at this perspective or 
16 that perspective, but here is how he changes. We 
17 know whether or not Michael Brown was shot at point 
18 blank range in the head based on that, yes or no, we 
19 know that. 
20 We are here today to tell you what you are 
21 saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on 
22 the evidence. 
23 And that's just an example. 
24 Virtually everything that you told the FBI on 
25 August 13th doesn't match up with the evidence,

So you're telling me he 
3 didn't get shot in the head at point blank range? 
4 What we are telling you is 
5 that the physical evidence doesn't match up with 
6 what you are telling us. That's just an example, 
7 okay. 
8 The entire layout of the scene is entirely 
9 different than what you described, okay. And when 
10 you come in here today and substantially change you 
11 say you saw and what you claim you saw on 
12 August 13th, that leads me to believe that maybe you 
13 didn't see this. And if that's the case, you need 
14 to tell me, okay. 
15 We're not even saying this, 
16 first of all. When you are running down the stairs, 
17 you say a lot of people were out there, you said you 
18 were scared, that's --
19 I tell you can I leave? I 
20 don't feel too comfortable right now. 
21 Okay. Now, if you want to 
22 go, that's fine.

2 You are telling me I didn't 
3 see what I saw. This is not the first time that it 
4 happened, they did it to me last time I was here and 
5 try to tell me. 
6 The reason the FBI 
7 challenged you when you gave the statement before 
8 was because they knew at that time that what you 
9 were saying didn't add up with the physical 
10 evidence, okay. 
11 You would agree that is right? 
12 If you all knew the physical 
13 evidence, why would there be a need for a witness if 
14 you have the evidence already. 
15 You have to have people that 
16 actually saw it, that's what we are trying to say, 
17 okay. We're the prosecutors on this case, 
18 okay. And we have to evaluate the case and 
19 determine whether or not there are going to be 
20 charges and whether or not we would take it to 
21 trial. 
22 And so we would have to meet with the 
23 witnesses and talk to them, particularly the ones 
24 who were concerned that what their saying doesn't 
25 match up with the physical evidence. We have to

15 When was this? 
16 It happened in the same week 
17 of him getting killed, the same week. And then to 
18 know for a fact that someone came down and burnt his 
19 memorial. 
20 That happened more recently, 
21 right. 
22 Yes, I smelt it burning.

2 There were other people, other Ferguson 
3 police sitting on their cars looking at it. And 
4 then to tell me I'm lying. 
5 There is a lot that went on 
6 in the aftermath of the shooting. A lot of people 
7 were scared because they heard gunshots. A lot of 
8 people were talking, so the problem is that 
9 sometimes people, you know, thought they saw 
10 something, really it was because other people were 
11 talking so much. 
12 So our job is to figure out what each 
13 individual actually saw and noticed. Not what was 
14 going on in the community, so that's why we wanted

1 since we was just best friends, he was just with me 
2 every day staying over there. If he needed 
3 something, I helped him out. I basically look at 
4 him just like a little brother. 
5 Q And so prior to August 9th when he got 
6 killed, how long had he been staying with you at 
7 your sister's house?

A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Using the laser pointer, can you 
21 point to the building where your sister's place is? 
22 A I would say it would have to be around, I 
23 don't know, it looks different from the sky view, it 
24 looks kind of different. I would say it would have 
25 to be over, okay, it had to be over here.

12 A 
Yes. 
Okay. So you realize that if Mike 
But if he was right here, I couldn't 
13 really tell because the building is in the way. I 
14 can only see what I saw was the officer and Mike 
15 Brown until I got all the way to the bottom of the 
16 steps and came and come across the parking lot. 
17 Q In your statement that you said that he 
18 was next to the vehicle and you helped them draw the 
19 picture and you said the vehicle was behind Mike 
20 Brown about 5 feet, you didn't see the vehicle 
21 behind Mike Brown? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Okay. So that wasn't correct? 
No, until I got down there that I actually 
25 saw the car.

3 could you tell if Mike Brown had been shot?

7 didn't know that personally.

1 Q Okay. You saw Mike Brown leave your 
2 apartment that day, when you looked out and saw him, 
3 can you recognize that that was Mike Brown? 
4 A Yes, the reason why I recognize it was 
5 Mike Brown is because, first off, I didn't know 
6 nobody that big was that young. Like he had been 
7 that big since we have been freshman. So that's 
8 another reason why I knew it was him. 
9 The second reason why I knew it was 
10 him, I recognize him by his socks and his khaki 
11 pants that he had on when he left my apartment. 
12 Q But with him kneeling down, you mean, you 
13 weren't getting a full body view of him? 
14 A But his legs were long and him on his 
15 knees and his back was towards me, I could see the 
16 lower half of his body. 
17 Q Okay. When he left your apartment that 
18 day, how about, was he wearing a hat?

He didn't have a hat on. 
Did you see the hat at all when you looked 
No, I didn't see the hat until I actually 
11 got there close enough to see everything. 
12 Q So when you saw him kneeling down, he was 
13 wearing what you remember he was wearing what he had 
14 on, but no hat? 
15 A Yes, he had on a gray T-shirt, he had on 
16 some khaki shorts, he had on some marijuana socks, 
17 they were yellow with green marijuana leafs on it, 
18 and he had on some white and black Nike flip flops. 
19 Q Now, this is one of those things I want to 
20 make sure that this is what you remember seeing as 
21 opposed to, like that day, as opposed to after you 
22 got down to the scene. 
23 You remember that's what he had on? 
24 A Yes, I know exactly that's what he had on 
25 when he left my apartment that day.

3 A No, I can't recall that. I cannot. 
4 Q How about what your sister was wearing 
5 that night? 
6 A She was in the bed, I don't think she was 
7 doing too much, she was pregnant so, she wasn't 
8 really doing too much moving around at the time. 
9 Q So, you know, , one of the things I'm 
10 wanting to kind of figure out is if your memory of 
11 what he was wearing is based upon the fact that you 
12 saw him down at the scene when you went down there 
13 as opposed to what you really remember that he had 
14 on the night before? 
15 A I know exactly what he had on cause he 
16 didn't change clothes because he couldn't get into 
17 his grandmother's house to get more clothes, cause 
18 that's where his clothes and belongings were at. 
19 Only thing he had brought to my house was some 
20 stereo speakers and his laptop. 
21 Q So he wore those same clothes for like the 
22 two weeks he was staying at your house? 
23 A No, not for two weeks, just like a couple 
24 days.

10 A I was out of the apartment. As soon as I 
11 hit the front door and got onto the balcony I heard, 
12 at least, I say about three to four shots. It was 
13 like a pause of me running down the steps, and then 
14 when I got to the end of the steps I heard several 
15 more shots.

When I ran out of the house, I ran over to

5 yelling. I was just like, they just kill my home 
6 boy for nothing, those were my exact words. 
7 Q Did you see Dorian Johnson when you were 
8 out there? 
9 A No, I didn't see him until I say about 
10 five minutes later because I was more worried on 
11 going to go tell his family what happened, but by 
12 the time I tried to get down to his family's house, 
13 his uncle's girlfriend was already coming up the 
14 street. 
15 And I don't know if she heard about 
16 what had happened or if somebody had told her, but 
17 she was coming and running up the street. 
18 And I guess when she found out it was 
19 him, she broke down in tears. And then Dorian 
20 walked up to me and he started crying. And he was 
21 like sick to his stomach, so he honestly threw up in 
22 the parking lot.

10 my cousin.

15 stopped in the middle of the grass hill and I just 
16 broke down.

1 A That wasn't necessary if only thing you 
2 want to do is talk to me. 
3 Q All right. And I understand you were not 
4 wanting to come talk to the police, I get that. But 
5 at some point you did go and talk to the police and 
6 you told them about what you saw? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And you admit today that at lot of what 
9 you told them on that day you didn't really see it? 
10 A Yes, it was more of me just finding out 
11 stuff here and there. 
12 Q , did you feel any pressure from 
13 other people in the complex or Michael Brown's 
14 family or did you feel like it was an obligation 
15 that you had to say that you saw those things when 
16 you really didn't? 
17 A I didn't think it was, I don't think 
18 nobody would lie about something. 
19 So in my mind, I honestly believe 
20 that's what happened. 
21 Q Okay. You now know that you didn't see 
22 those things?

A

I did not.

No, I didn't. I didn't hear about 
You didn't hear about that? 
No. 
You originally told the officers, or told 
7 the police that you saw the officer stand over Mike 
8 Brown after he fell in the street and stand over him 
9 and shoot him four more times. 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, that is what I was told, yes. 
And that would mean he had gunshot wounds 
12 in his back, right? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
I guess. 
He's laying on his front, right, facedown. 
15 So any gunshots wounds would have to be entry wounds 
16 somewhere on his backside, right?

But you did hear eight more shots fairly 
21 quick in succession, right? 
22 A Yes, I don't know if it was eight, but I 
23 could say it was more than five. 
24 Q This is after he was already laying on the 
25 pavement?

Is there anything else that you think this 
3 grand jury needs to know that maybe I didn't ask you 
4 about? 
5 A It's just about, not just, I've been 
6 dealing with, trust me, I've lived out in Ferguson 
7 for, I can honestly say about almost six years. 
8 Harassment, yes, I dealt through that growing up 
9 over there in that area. 
10 I was even like pulled off of my 
11 school bus one time telling me I broke in someone's 
12 house. And when I asked them why would I break in 
13 someone's house when I was at school, it is always 
14 harassment. They pull up on you and just ask you 
15 questions. Where you going and just all type of, 
16 just harassment like. 
17 I should be able to live, I should be 
18 able to feel safe where I live. I've got nephews 
19 growing up around this area. I feel like it's not 
20 the right environment for kids to even have to grow 
21 up like. Even Michael Brown being shot, that was a 
22 regular day, people walking dogs, kids out there 
23 playing, that's not the type of scene for anything 
24 to go down like that. 
25 And then to leave him sitting outside

1 for hours so the whole community can see it, kids 
2 and all, I feel like that's the most form of 
3 disrespect. Not just to Michael Brown, but to his 
4 family. That's not something they should just have 
5 to sit there and look at. 
6 And then another thing, for his 
7 memorial to be burnt down and for me to honestly see 
8 that with my own eyes, his memorial going up in 
9 flames. Like there was gasoline poured on it. Like 
10 they tried to say on the news, I don't know if they 
11 said on the news, but they said that candles started 
12 the memorial to burn it down. 
13 Now, I'm out there, I live out there 
14 every day. The candles are always in the middle of 
15 the street. There was not a candle over there by 
16 the light pole for it to blow up and make that type 
17 of explosion and it's on videotape. One of my 
18 family members actually got a video tape of it, he 
19 put it on viral, he put it on Facebook viral. 
20 For me to go out and see two 
21 Caucasian Ferguson officers sitting by my sister's 
22 parking lot sitting on the car looking at it go up 
23 in flames. 
24 And it took the only African-American

1 extinguisher, that's disrespectful. And I honestly 
2 feel like that. 
3 And he already got killed, people 
4 throwing dirt on his name and all of this, for his 
5 memorial to be burnt down. I don't think that 
6 that's right at all. 
7 For a person that was kind hearted 
8 who did nothing to nobody. Just because he was big 
9 didn't mean a thing, that man had a heart of gold. 
10 If he had it, he would given you his leg or vice

12 Q You know, , I think what you are 
13 talking about, what has happened since Michael 
14 Brown's death. 
15 A Since the death that I have been going 
16 through out there at Ferguson. 
17 Q But it has opened a lot of people's eyes 
18 about what really has been going on. And I 
19 understand that both before and after Michael Brown 
20 died. 
21 What this grand jury is going to have 
22 to decide is what's going to happen involving the 
23 death of Michael Brown. We can't fix the problems 
24 that happened before that and we can't necessarily, 
25 you know, we're not responsible in this proceeding

13 had a question. Was Michael Brown ever with you 
14 when you were harassed by the police or do you know 
15 of any situations where he told you a story that he 
16 had been harassed? 
17 A Not him personally, but me, yes. Not with 
18 him, but we were harassed by -- because Northwinds 
19 has and Canfield have security guards. We both were 
20 harassed by the security guards that legally got the 
21 right to hold guns and all that type of thing. 
22 Police-wise me and him together, no. If I was ever 
23 harassed, it was either by myself type of situation.

21 for tat. But I don't know honestly why he was 
22 living with his grandmother, I honestly don't.

14 five minutes away from his grandmother's house. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: But Michael wasn't living 
16 with her? 
17 A No, we would go over there sometimes and 
18 go hang out with his little brother and his little 
19 sister, which is basically my little cousins now. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Did Mike ever talk to you 
21 about why he didn't live with his mom? Was it

12 was just bickering and arguing a whole lot. And he

14 out of the house and then he was at my house.

2 A Yes. I don't know if him storming out had 
3 something to do with her going to the hospital or if 
4 it was just a whole bunch of stuff just adding up. 
5 But, yeah, she was in the hospital at the time, 
6 that's why he couldn't go to her house and get any

1 with the attitude. He would have to tell me, he 
2 used to have to tell me to calm down and stop being 
3 so serious about things. 
4 We didn't do nothing. We did smoke 
5 marijuana, but if we did, it was in an enclosed

9 One thing I did want to 
10 ask if I could, was there, to your knowledge, 
11 or do you know any of the family history, was there 
12 any history that Michael Brown may have any type of 
13 like what they call ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, 
14 hyperactivity, or anything of that nature? 
15 A ADD is when you like can't stop moving and 
16 got to move around all the time. 
17 Well, yeah, lose focus. 
18 A No, he was more of a home body. I used to 
19 have to like go get him and make him put on clothes 
20 and walk to the store like. And really and truly 
21 his granny was overprotective of him. 
22 At that time I was one of them like 
23 why is she overprotective, now I know. Now after 
24 the fact, I know why she was being so overprotective

MS. WHIRLEY: Why was it? 
Because of situations like this. Because 
3 if you notice, the people that don't deserve it, it 
4 usually happens to them. He didn't deserve it. 
5 There's been testimony 
6 that in speaking with Michael and he was giving a 
7 response back to somebody, that Michael would have 
8 the action of raising his head and fluttering his 
9 eyes while giving a response and doing that 
10 repetitively, you know, whenever he gave a response, 
11 he would raise up his head and, you know, flutter

18 So you 
19 say you don't know why he couldn't live with his 
20 family, it was none of your business. I don't mean 
21 to disrespect your friend, the problem I have with 
22 that is you say he's your best friend and he is 
23 living with your sister who is pregnant and has two 
24 small children in the home. 
25 A Yes.

1 And you never thought to 
2 ask him why he couldn't live with his family member, 
3 did you think it could be some type of volatile 
4 situation your family could be put into? 
5 A No, cause I didn't think about it like 
6 that. We was together all day anyway, so my sister 
7 was the one that told me it wasn't no problem with 
8 him coming over. 
9 Okay. And you did say 
10 that you did 
11 A As long as I've known him, he was never 
12 living with his mother from the get-go. He was 
13 always living with his grandmother, that's how we 
14 met from his grandmother's house because we went to 
15 school together. 
16 You don't know why his 
17 grandmother was in the hospital, could it possibly 
18 have been from their argument? 
19 A I don't know. I don't know if it was 
20 slowly just building up, building up, I don't know 
21 if she was depressed, whatever sent her to the 
22 hospital. At that point in time she was in the 
23 hospital for a few days. 
24 This is his grandmother, 
25 he told you he stormed out and left, he couldn't

1 live with her. 
A Yes, they was arguing. 2 
3 Again, I don't mean to 
4 talk bad about your friend, you feel like that is 
5 okay behavior to do with his grandmother, find it 
6 hard to believe he had similar behavior with a 
7 stranger? 
8 A No, it is not like that cause I was going 
9 through problems with my mother at the time also, 
10 that's why I was living down at my sister's house. 
11 I really don't know what their 
12 problem was, but I know I was already going through 
13 my own little situation to be in his life at that 
14 time. I just knew he was my friend and I was going 
15 to look out for him. I guess just the way I know he 
16 would look out for me. 
17 Regardless? 
18 A Yes. 
19 I have on page 16 of your 
20 recorded statement, you said with his hands on his 
21 knees like this. 
22 And then later you said he was on his 
23 knee, he was on his knee, he was on his knees, and 
24 then today you say he was on his knees with his 
25 hands up. Those are three very different.

3 the window every single time that part has never 
4 changed. 
5 So you are saying that 
6 what we heard is wrong, what we heard you say?

11 that you heard Michael tell Dorian Johnson to run 
12 for his life and you saw Dorian Johnson leave. Now

21 let me just check, because I don't remember you 
22 telling us in today's statement that Michael was 
23 pleading for his life. Because in your past

25 his life. Please don't shoot, please don't shoot,

2 A It is just like what I told her earlier, 
3 she told me not stuff that I heard and I admitted 
4 the first interview was most speculation and stuff 
5 that I heard either from Dorian, neighbors, it was 
6 just a whole lot of talk. 
7 And that's why I'm asking 
8 you because we don't know, there is three different 
9 things that you said and I'm going to ask you this 
10 as well, it is a hard question for me to ask, but 
11 the first one you have admitted is not really what 
12 happened. 
13 A Yes. 
14 And the second one, which 
15 is a little less intricate, yeah, it happened, but 
16 not so much. How are we, in the first statement you 
17 even told somebody to look into your soul and to 
18 look into your eyes, that you would never ever lie, 
19 how do we know that today's statement is the truth? 
20 A It is not a lie if the person was actually 
21 there, told me exactly what happened. So I didn't 
22 feel like it was a lie. I didn't feel like it was a 
23 lie at all. And the way that Dorian came to me, the 
24 look he gave me in his eyes, he wouldn't lie to me 
25 about something like that knowing that that was my

1 laser where you saw that car as soon as you walked

3 A Michael Brown was right here, the car had 
4 to be where the C was at. If he was right here, it 
5 had to be in front of the C or where the C was at. 
6 So if we had photograph 
7 evidence and again, the FBI, if we have evidence 
8 showing the car is not in that location, how would 
9 you explain that? 
10 A Urn, really and truly, where the car was 
11 located really doesn't have anything to do with what 
12 honestly happened because he was unarmed, he didn't 
13 put up a fight, and he was assassinated for what 
14 reason. So, honestly, what does the car have to do 
15 with it? 
16 The only reason 
17 I ask that is if the car was not moved and it was in 
18 that location that we've seen the photographs, then 
19 you would have been able to see any altercation if 
20 there was a fight by the car? 
21 A I wasn't really, let me ask you a 
22 question. If you just seen your best friend get 
23 murdered, you really would be thinking about where a 
24 car was located? That's an honest question.

15 you know, if you turn to Jesus, he'll save you, 
16 whatever, something to that effect. 
17 Q So Mike is talking about Jesus? 
18 A Right. 
19 Q And did they continue to talk, or what 
20 happened next? 
21 
22 
A Uh, yeah, the conversation kind of, you 
know, started here and then went back to the 
23 truck for a tool or something, and Mike followed him 
24 over there. And they talk and I continued to work 
25 on the hole, I don't know what all they talked

You couldn't hear them? 
Not from the other side of the truck. I 
4 did go over after a few minutes and kind of go, hey, 
5 we're trying to work here. You know, they were 
6 talking about pictures of Jesus on the wall and 
7 different things. 
8 Q Okay. Did Mike, and we know who we are 
9 talking about Mike Brown, the young man that was 
10 killed. Did he appear to you to be in an agitated 
11 mood or aggressive, or anything like that? 
12 A He flinched his fist a couple times and 
13 looked up at the sky when they were over here 
14 talking, I came around to see what's going on, he 
15 flinched his fist a couple times and like looking 
16 up. I kind of found it odd. 
17 You know, take a step back whenever 
18 we were over here in this conversation, they were 
19 talking about the socks, and Mike said, you know, 
20 you've got to try everything in this life, you know, 
21 everything to figure out where you want to go in 
22 this world. And that kind of led me to believe he 
23 is probably high. 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And he kind of seemed that he came down

1 when he was talking to over here, like he came 
2 down from the high. 
3 Q Describe what that looked like, him coming 
4 down from a high? 
5 
6 
A It was them talking about pictures of 
Jesus on the wall and said something to the 
7 effect of how you might have a picture of Jesus on 
8 your wall, well, the devil has got a picture of me 
9 on his wall. Whenever I come down, he's going to be 
10 the person in charge. he's a character. I 
11 don't know if you guys have seen him. 
12 At the end of the conversation when 
13 it was all said and done, Mike said, you know, nice 
14 talking to you, and he shook hand. I could 
15 kind of tell that he was grounded, you know. 
16 Q Okay. Describe to me why you think he was

No. 
Did you see him handling marijuana? 
No. 
Okay. So tell me about your assumption 
The socks. 
Oh, the socks, okay. He said nothing was 
9 wrong with smoking? 
10 A I was up there for four weeks and it was a 
11 day-to-day thing I smelled marijuana a lot around 
12 all of the apartment buildings. Don't get me wrong, 
13 you know, I don't want to stereotype anybody, but a 
14 guy with marijuana leafs on his socks is probably 
15 smoking marijuana. 
16 Q I was curious about whether you thought he 
17 appeared high though that morning when you saw him, 
18 and that's why I was asking a few detailed questions 
19 about it. There was nothing that made him appear 
20 high except for the socks? 
21 A Right. And the fact that he came down 
22 asking if one of us were mad, you know, kind of 
23 paranoid, you know. 
24 Q To you that seem kind of paranoid? 
25 A Right.

1 Initially, I heard a single shot 
2 fired and peered around the corner to see a black 
3 male walking away, at which time I heard another 
4 shot and saw the white cop behind the black man. I 
5 was about 50 to 60 yards away watching the black man 
6 stumble away from the officer and turn with his 
7 hands raised yelling, okay, okay. 
8 Officer proceeded to unload his clip 
9 into the black man, at least six to seven more 
10 shots. 
11 Thirty minutes before the incident, 
12 fellow co-worker spoke with the black 
13 man who spoke of Jesus and life and honest people. 
14 Mike was his name. He was wearing a Cardinals ball 
15 cap, gray shirt, jean shorts, with yellow pot leaf 
16 socks and sandals. 
17 At the time of the incident after 
18 hearing the first and second shots, I stood there 
19 like a deer in the headlights, stunned to see and 
20 believe what was happening. 
21 Mike said he was going to the 
22 convenience store to get a few things and would be 
23 right back. We were working on his building and 
24 engaged in conversation. He seemed like a nice guy.

I'm talking your opinion? 
See, I kind of have a mixed opinion on it. 
Okay. 
I take the hands going down and kind of 
5 moving quicker towards the cop as either I'm falling 
6 to my death or okay, you've already shot me a couple 
7 times, I'm coming at you. 
8 Q So it could be either of those. So when 
9 he had his hands up, what was your impression then 
10 when he was saying okay, okay, okay? 
11 A Initially I was like okay, he's giving up, 
12 you know, that was my impression.

The other person, and his name is Dorian 
3 that we talked about, did you see him at any point 
4 when the shooting was going on? 
5 A No, like I said earlier, I never saw him 
6 after he was, they were going to the convenience 
7 store. 
8 Q Okay. You never, I think you already 
9 answered this too, so bear with me. You never, once 
10 you came back after the shooting was over and you 
11 came out, what did you see as far as the scene was 
12 concerned, describe that for us after the shooting 
13 was over. 
14 A All I saw was there was, at this point, 
15 there was three cops. The other two cops showed up, 
16 it must have been as it was happening or right 
17 after. They came up and they are all staring, 
18 looking at the ground. Mike Brown's laying about 
19 right here, and one of the cops grabs a roll of tape 
20 and starts taping it off. 
21 Q Did you notice a police car or just a lot 
22 of police cars around at that point? 
23 A There was an SUV, I believe, right about 
24 in this vicinity and that was

2 the street. 
3 Q Were you there much longer after this 
4 shooting occurred or did you get out of there soon 
5 after? 
6 A We got out pretty quick. and I, you 
7 know, he said we probably should go, you know, being 
8 two white guys, that's just my feeling. He said we 
9 should probably get out of here. I think things 
10 about to go -- sorry.

1 MS. ALIZADEH: I couldn't hear what you 
2 said, that last part. 
3 A I said that I wasn't a laborer, my job 
4 wasn't to labor, I was out there just to make sure 
5 that the job got done. 
6 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Now, how did you come to, 
7 since you left that, you did write a statement that 
8 same day, but you left. How did you get to talk to 
9 the police or the FBI about what you saw, how did 
10 that happen? 
11 A Uh, they showed up at my house. I had a 
12 St. Louis County detective show up, and after that 
13 another St. Louis County detective, along with an 
14 FBI agent. And then a third time they picked me up, 
15 took me down to Clayton down here and put me in an 
16 interrogation room and asked me a bunch of questions 
17 that I answered the best I could. 
18 Q Do you know how they found out about you? 
19 How they knew to come to your house? 
20 A I don't know for sure, but if I had to 
21 guess, I'm thinking they probably got the name of 
22 the company I work for from the apartment complex 
23 and so on and so forth.

Yes. 
And where were you when you heard the

21 ground, which didn't make sense to me we had a lot 
22 of pipe on the ground. So I didn't know what it 
23 was. 
24 Q All right. Could you see anything 
25 happening when you heard the second shot?

13 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So just so I can be 
14 clear, you first saw Mike earlier in the morning and 
15 he was by himself and he spoke to a little bit

17 conversation?

10 officer move then? Is he still coming toward 
11 Michael Brown? 
12 A I mean, after he turned around and had his 
13 hands up, he kind of just stopped and stood there. 
14 And then that's when the shooting occurred. I mean, 
15 he was going, turned around and then started 
16 shooting, and then Michael Brown, Michael Brown was 
17 kind of moving at him like I'm giving up, hands up. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So, now, you said I'm 
19 giving up, hands up. You didn't hear him say that? 
20 A He said, okay, okay, okay, that to me 
21 means --
22 MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to be clear. 
23 When you said that, that was what you are 
24 interpreting, right? 
25 A Yes.

MS. ALIZADEH: So what I'm trying to

3 correct? 
4 A He was falling and then he went behind the 
5 building.

7 goes beyond the building from your vantage point?

MS. ALIZADEH: Right. 
I saw him to about where that white car is 
12 and then he was going down. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: So where is the officer 
14 when that happens? 
15 A He was about, right about this 
16 intersection right here. (indicating) 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: So you can still see the 
18 officer when Michael Brown disappeared from your 
19 view? 
20 A That is correct. He was kind of going 
21 straight when the officer was kind of moving back 
22 and sideways, and he kind of moved at an angle. At 
23 one point, the shots were this way and more went 
24 almost at me.

6 At the

11 he had a weapon?

Thank you.

16 might have been touching his torso?

18 his hands kind of over his belly, you know, like, 
19 oh, I've got shot in the belly. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So after the third 
21 shot, the total third shot, or after the third shot

9 A Uh, no, I didn't see any blood. I did see 
10 the back of his shirt, you know, like somebody 
11 pinched your shirt or whatever, looked like a bullet 
12 went through him. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And when you said,

1 After 
2 Michael turned around and he's advancing towards the 
3 officer and you hear the shots, was it a continuous 
4 burst of shots, was there a shot and a pause and 
5 more shots? 
6 A It was continuous. 
7 You think it was three or 
8 four, or how many? 
9 A It was at least six, maybe seven, like I 
10 said, he unloaded his clip it seemed like. It was a 
11 barrage. It seemed unnecessary. 
12 Again, 
13 after Michael Brown turned around, his hands are up, 
14 either he started walking first or the gunshots

2 I'm trying to get a sense

4 kind of visualize how it is laid out. If sound 
5 echos or travels through there very easily or it is 
6 absorbed by the buildings? 
7 A Well, it wasn't like a normal gunshot. It 
8 sounded different and, you know, that's kind of why 
9 I thought PVC to begin with, but that wasn't the 
10 case.

17 that you heard previously testify. His statement is 
18 recorded on a disc that is marked Grand Jury Exhibit

20 And, urn, before we start recording, I was 
21 explaining to the grand jurors that there is about 
22 an hour and ten minutes of actual time where 
23 is being interviewed by the police. And so 
24 there is quite a bit of time where nothing is 
25 happening. He will be sitting in a room by himself.

1 We are going to fast forward, as it were, on the 
2 counter it will be 16 hours 17 minutes and 45 
3 seconds, or whereabouts, as close as Sheila can get. 
4 That will be about where the interview 
5 begins, and then the interview, there's a break in 
6 the interview at 1726, 17 hours, 26 minutes and 38 
7 seconds. Where asked for some water and 
8 the interview, there is a break in the interview but 
9 the interview never resumes after that. 
10 So we're going to stop it at the point 
11 where he asked for water and the detectives leave 
12 the room to get water, all right? 
13 So, at this time, also just for the sake 
14 of the recording, one of the grand jurors has 
15 indicated he is expecting a phone call that he has 
16 to take. So if I get the high sign during the 
17 recording that he's getting a call, we will go ahead 
18 and pause the video so that he can quickly take that 
19 call because we have to make sure you all are 
20 hearing the same thing, okay. So at this time,
