Thank you. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Could this amount of THC 
3 that was found in the blood be, is it possible that 
4 someone who is ingesting that amount on a regular 
5 basis and not be dead? 
6 A Well, marijuana really isn't lethal. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
8 A So it couldn't kill him. As far as the 
9 affects, it would take a lot of marijuana on a 
10 regular basis to stay at this kind of level. So I 
11 would say that's less likely. 
12 
13 
14 
A 
MS. WHIRLEY: That's less likely. 
Yeah.

15 amount of marijuana?

19

A 
On a daily basis. 
MS. WHIRLEY: On a daily basis or regular 
Yes. 
Would a 
21 cigar size, I guess, you know how they take the 
22 cigar and they put the marijuana in it. Will a 
23 cigar size give you that kind of dose? I know you 
24 mentioned a joint, but now we're talking about a 
25 cigar?

1 A Is that possible? Yes. See again, purity 
2 like low end purity is like 3 percent Delta-9, high 
3 end is like 20 percent. So that's a huge range, 
4 okay. Is it possible that the cigar got stuck with 
5 the higher end stuff? Yes, it is. 
6 You can reach this without 
7 waxing, I guess regular marijuana in the cigar? 
8 A I'm not sure, I'm not sure. I think it 
9 would be possible, but I'm not positive on that. 
10 I want to make 
11 sure I understand regarding larger person, you talk 
12 about the affects of --
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you speak up a little 
14 bit, sorry? 
15 I just wanted to make 
16 sure when you are talking about that, you are 
17 talking about the difference between the affects of 
18 a person who is larger versus the content in the 
19 blood. The affects would not be affected by the 
20 size of the person, but the content in the blood 
21 would be. 
22 A That is correct. It is a dose response. 
23 So it's like a smaller person takes less, a larger 
24 person takes more, you get the same affects.

1 question. When you smoke marijuana and 
2 he's talking about a blunt, through the cigar 
3 wrapper versus the cigarette papers, are you -- you 
4 are likely ingesting more of the marijuana when you 
5 are smoking it in a blunt versus the cigarette 
6 papers because they burn much quicker and smoke, 
7 would you agree or not? 
8 
9 
A Yeah, if it burns much quicker, yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Not that we are marijuana 
10 smokers, you know, but it appears if you watch it on 
11 TV, that the cigarette is burning much faster than 
12 when they smoke with a blunt. I think that's why a 
13 lot of people do the blunt? 
14 A Yes, because it is the dose and it's the 
15 destruction of the drug while you are not inhaling, 
16 yes. 
17 That raises a 
18 question. How is waxing taken into the body, is it 
19 smoked or is it, I mean, is it a waxy, sticky 
20 substance? 
21 A Yeah, it could be. It could be put in a 
22 blunt and smoked, it could be whatever as long as it 
23 gets into your body. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Is there a depending, you 
25 know, I think we can all understand that marijuana

1 can be eaten, it can be smoked, apparently it can be 
2 injected, the THC at least. Is there a difference 
3 in how quickly it would impair you or how quickly it 
4 would be in your system depending on how it is 
5 ingested. 
6 A Sure, oral is the worst. Anything that 
7 goes in your mouth goes to your stomach. It has a 
8 bunch of acids in there, it chews it up and then it 
9 goes to the liver. Once it is picked up by the 
10 blood, it goes into the liver. The liver chews it 
11 up as metabolism. So the oral would give you the 
12 least bang for the buck and probably take the 
13 longest because it has to be absorbed and 
14 metabolized and so son. 
15 When you inhale something it goes 
16 into your lungs, okay. And the heart blood goes 
17 from the right side to the lungs, to the left side 
18 and to the body, and goes to what is called the 
19 carotid arteries here in the aortic arch. So 
20 anything that goes in by inhalation gets up to the 
21 brain within like two, maybe three heartbeats. So 
22 it gets in and gives you a much quicker effect. 
23 Especially than oral. 
24 So just 
25 in your experience, we'll talk to others who have

1 more hands on with this specific, in your experience 
2 then would you assume that an autopsy or examination 
3 would show in the internal organs would be able to 
4 tell if something was smoked or ingested orally? 
5 A No, reasonably, no. Not unless there was 
6 something really unusual, like you are inhaling 
7 silica gel, or something like that. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Or perhaps if the stomach 
9 contents contained. 
10 A Leafy green material in the stomach 
11 contents. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Right. Any other 
13 questions? 
14 You said 
15 this THC stuff, if I heard you correctly, it binds 
16 with the fat cells; is that right? 
17 A Yeah, it does. 
18 Is that why you get hungry 
19 after you smoke a joint? Seriously, I'm just 
20 saying. 
21 
22 
A No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't know what you are 
23 talking about? 
24 I don't either apparently.

No, that has nothing to do with it. What

1 it is, reasonably that is lowering the blood sugar. 
2 So you start feeling hungry and get the munchies. 
3 MS. WHIRLEY: You said marijuana lowers 
4 the blood sugar? 
5 A That would be my, yes, that's what I 
6 believe. 
7 If it lowers 
8 the blood sugar, I had an uncle who is diabetic, 
9 when his blood sugar would be very low, he would 
10 get, I'm just going to say it he would get volatile, 
11 he would get agitated very easily. So would that be 
12 a possibility? 
13 A That would be a possibility, yes. If the 
14 blood sugar got down low enough, that would take, 
15 that would be work. 
16 And would the Delta-9-THC 
17 levels have an affect on the blood sugar level? 
18 A No. 
19 So the higher the 
20 Delta-THC would not necessarily constitute a lower 
21 blood sugar level? 
22 A Well, it would indicate that, yes, okay, 
23 but it hasn't been like so much THC and so much 
24 sugar, it hasn't done that.

1 to the readings of the 45 grams, and in your 
2 opinion, how well could Michael Brown function? 
3 A That's really tough to say just looking at 
4 the lab test. It is really tough to say. I know 
5 the drug was impairing the system, the exact parts 
6 of his nervous system that were impaired, how that 
7 would be demonstrated I can't predict. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
9 So you 
10 are saying he could experience some kind of 
11 impairment? 
12 A Yes, it would be impairment. 
13 Or he could be functioning 
14 normally? 
15 A No, not normal. The impairment would be 
16 present. The degree of the impairment would be 
17 based on him personally, his history with marijuana, 
18 his underlying chemistry, a whole bunch of other 
19 factors. So how it would exactly affect him is, I 
20 can't predict. I know it would have an affect 
21 because it is psychoactive. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: So a person could be 
23 impaired, because they have this in their system, 
24 but they could be sitting here talking and you might 
25 not even know they were impaired?

A That's correct. 
I have one 
3 more thing I want to ask you. You said earlier the

the 
the 
the 
drugs would have a greater effect on them? 
A Yes. 
Okay. Thank you. 
A That's just through the non specificity 
drug. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Again, when you talk about 
greater affect coming up, going from what 
13 talked about, that does not necessarily 
of 
14 mean that they are going to act impaired to someone 
15 who is sitting there talking to them? 
16 A No, I can't predict what they will or will 
17 not do. 
18 
19 
MS. WHIRLEY: Right, okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? 
20 One more question from me, 
21 I know you say you are not a 
22 medical doctor, but was there any reports or any 
23 notes stating the fact that when he was younger, 
24 while he was in high school or anything that he was 
25 taking any hypertension medicine or any mental --

I'm not aware of anything. 
Okay, thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: To tell you, I do not 
4 believe we have any kind of medical history or 
5 anything of that nature on him. 
6 Because my question would 
7 be, could some of the drugs be in his system versus 
8 when he was smoking it. Could that, you know --
9 A Well, it is possible some drugs could be 
10 present, but below detection, our cutoff limits. 
11 There is actually a theory that says you have your 
12 first, from your first spoon of baby food, the 
13 molecules are still floating around in your body, 
14 which is interesting. So there could be other drugs 
15 present at very low levels. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And just to be clear, THC 
17 is only found in marijuana, correct? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is not like we hear 
20 about people saying I had a poppyseed bagel and so

One more question, it is 
my last. There is no way with 
4 these levels would it be possible for him to have

19 possible DNA from trace cases, and then write

1 about trace DNA. 
2 
3 
Q 
A 
Tell us what that means. 
Okay. Trace evidence is what is left 
Page 90 
4 behind when a material or a person made contact, so 
5 that can be footprints, fingerprints, soil samples, 
6 hair, fibers, or DNA. In our lab, what we refer to 
7 as a trace case, is something that the biologist 
8 doesn't actually examine, I don't actually test it, 
9 but I would save samples to be tested for DNA. 
10 Some examples of this are, urn, like a 
11 swab taken from the steering wheel of a recovered 
12 stolen vehicle where it isn't blood, you are trying 
13 to find out who stole the car, who was driving the 
14 car. 
15 It could be a shirt left behind from 
16 a robbery, so you would swab that for DNA, or a 
17 knife from a domestic assault. You wanted to know 
18 who was actually holding the knife, so you would 
19 swab it for user DNA. 
20 So those are the kind of things that 
21 we consider trace. Where it is not actually a body 
22 fluid that we are testing for, but we think that 
23 there might be DNA left behind. And usually what 
24 this is is from allele cells or skin cells. 
25 Q

1 someone actually collects what they think might be 
2 useful for the lab in determining whether there is 
3 DNA present, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Someone is swabbing and someone is doing 
6 that at the crime scene and then they submit it to 
7 you. Is there a certain way that that must be 
8 presented to you in order for it to be useful, for 
9 you to determine whether or not it has DNA or 
10 potentially --
11 A Well, I mean, we don't know because you 
12 can't see anything. So a lot of times the crime 
13 scene will swab things themselves and submit the 
14 actual swabs, or they will submit actual items like 
15 knives or shirts that I would then swab. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A Areas that I think would be useful areas 
18 to swab. 
19 Q Does the crime scene or the case officer 
20 tell you a little bit about the case for you to 
21 figure out what might be useful? 
22 A Yes. You do get a brief scenario of what 
23 happened. Like that gives you information about 
24 what is relevant or probative. For example, for a 
25 shirt, typically I would swab areas that would most

1 likely touch the skin. So like cuffs or the 
2 neckline, things like that. 
3 Q Can you tell us how you began a case, I 
4 mean, it comes to the lab, I guess, and then how do 
5 you get ahold of it? 
6 A When evidence is submitted to the lab, it 
7 is submitted to the front counter where evidence 
8 technicians take it in, make sure that it is 
9 properly packaged and sealed. We do not except 
10 improperly packaged evidence. 
11 So you would get evidence, either in 
12 a box or a package, it would also have a receipt 
13 with it. And the evidence receipt just details all 
14 of the pertinent information as when the incident 
15 happened, the location, what kind of offense it is, 
16 urn, who the victim is, who the suspect is, and then 
17 what actually is inside of the packages or boxes. 
18 So this evidence is then entered into 
19 our lab system, the actual evidence would be stored 
20 in our vaults, a secure location, until it is 
21 actually worked and the receipts would, they're 
22 stored back in biology and then we work them. It 
23 depends, but usually first end, first out. We do 
24 the crimes against persons cases first, they are 
25 more of a priority.

21 pictures for yourself as you are writing your 
22 report, is that what you told us? 
23 A What was that? 
24 Q You take those pictures for your purposes 
25 to complete your report?

A No, we are not required to take pictures. 
In specific cases we do take pictures. In this 
3 case, I decided to take pictures of certain items. 
4 Q Okay. Now, in this specific case, we see 
5 a Q and then numbers. Can you tell us what that 
6 represents? 
7 A A Q is, it just means a questioned item, 
8 so it is something that I am actually testing. 
9 Whereas later in the report you might see a K, and 
10 the K stands for a known, which is just a known 
11 reference standard taken from a person to be used 
12 for elimination or comparison purposes in DNA. And 
13 it is a known reference standard which means it came 
14 from that person in the forms of blood or saliva. 
15 Q So you know whose blood or saliva you 
16 have? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you had a known reference sample from 
19 Michael Brown; is that correct? 
A Yes. 
Q Is that in the form of blood? 
A His blood. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Okay. Did you have a known sample of the 
24 officer, Darren Wilson? 
25 A Yes.

Q Was that in the form of saliva? 
A Yes, it was a buccal swab. 
1 
2 
3 Q It is what you referred to as a buccal 
4 swab? 
5 A A buccal swab is a swab that is used to 
6 rub against the side of the mouth, against the 
7 cheek. So it takes, actually, where the DNA is 
8 coming from the cheek cells, but in the form of 
9 saliva. 
10 Q So that was your way of having a DNA 
11 sample from both the officer and Michael Brown; is 
12 that correct? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Now, you can see we all have a copy of 
15 your report dated, it was entered, it says 
16 8/11/2014, approved on 8/19/2014. What does 
17 administrative approval mean? 
18 A That is the signature of a person who 
19 tech-reviewed my report. What a tech review is, it 
20 is just kind of a double-check done by a peer in the 
21 same discipline to insure accuracy between the 
22 analyst notes and the report. 
23 Q Now Q1 through Q21 are items that you, I 
24 guess, that are questionable, is that what you said? 
25 A Yes.

5 Q 
Page 97 
Are these items that you took photographs 
I did not take photos of every single 
Okay. All right. Let's start to go 
6 through these. This tells us the items that you 
7 checked based on the information that you were told 
8 and the items that were brought to you; is that 
9 correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. So you did, just go ahead and 
12 tell us what you did. 
13 A Well, you are looking at the first report. 
14 I started with Michael Brown's clothing. So do you 
15 want me to go through Q1 or say everything I did? 
16 Q Tell us what you did. You can go through 
17 by Q1, whatever works for you, as long as you tell 
18 us, you know, what you did. 
19 A Sure. Q1 was Michael Brown's T-shirt, I 
20 just, we first do a visual examination so I would 
21 describe it, what it looked like. 
22 It had red brown stains, there were 
23 several holes in his shirt. I tested for blood. 
24 And then I also did a swabbing of the non blood 
25 stained areas for possible trace, since it was

1 alleged that there was contact between Officer 
2 Wilson and Michael Brown. 
3 It was hard to do this because the 
4 shirt was extremely bloody. So I just swabbed the 
5 areas that were not blood stained. 
6 Q You, of course, always wear gloves when 
7 you are handling any items; is that correct? 
8 A Yes, we wear personal protective 
9 equipment, which includes a lab coat, a mask, 
10 gloves, we use sterile equipment, we open one 
11 package of evidence at a time, we clean our work 
12 area. 
13 Q And these are things you do to prevent 
14 contamination or cross-contamination; is that 
15 correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Just to kind of, I guess, make it go a 
18 little faster since everyone has a copy of the 
19 report, all of these items you actually, did you 
20 test all of these items? 
21 A I have to go through 
22 Q Yeah, go ahead and look at it. 
23 A All of the clothing I tested, I tested for 
24 blood. As well as there was swabs taken from 
25 Michael Brown's hands, those were all tested for

1 blood as well. And then there were fingernail 
2 scrapings that were submitted, and I tested those 
3 and also swabbed those again for trace in case there 
4 was contact, such as scratching, things like that. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask you what did you 
6 swab for trace, the fingernail scrapings? 
7 A Yes. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So these fingernail 
9 scrapings were done by someone else, correct, like 
10 at the morgue? 
11 A Yeah. They labeled it fingernail 
12 scrapings, clippings, but they actually, I looked 
13 back, they were actually clippings. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Nail clippings. 
They take nail clippings. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That was forwarded to the 
18 lab, the nail clippings? 
19 A Yes. So what we do we swab the underside 
20 that you can tell for possible trace in case, again, 
21 there was contact. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. I didn't know 
23 if you were swabbing a swab when you talked about 
24 it.

1 Q (By Ms. Whirley) It looks like you 
2 swabbed, there was a swab collected and forwarded to 
3 you that represented the Brown's, the left back of 
4 his hands; is that correct? 
5 Yes. A 
6 And also the right palm, the right palm of Q 
7 
8 
9 
10 
hand? 
A Yes. 
Q And right back of hand? 
A Yes. Those were all tested for blood. 
11 And then there was a piece of, you have Q 
12 Q11, apparent skin or hardened nasal mucus? 
13 A Yes, when I, when I received it, all the 
14 information really said was something from the 
15 exterior of the door. And looking at it, I did 
16 ultimately know right away what it was. So I called 
17 it apparent skin, or harden nasal mucus, because I 
18 wasn't sure. It was very small. I took a picture 
19 of it. 
20 Q Okay. We'll look at those pictures. And 
21 you were told, or it was on the evidence receipt, 
22 where these items came from? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q Like from the front exterior door of the 
25 Ferguson Police Department Vehicle 108 for that one?

A 
Q 
Page 101 
Yes. 
Then there's also a swab of the rear 
3 passenger exterior door of that same vehicle, which 
4 is Q12? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And then blood stains from the 
7 area on Canfield. And then Q15, actually, the other 
8 items that I talk about when I mention swabs taken 
9 from Brown's hands, it says suspect Brown, and now 
10 on Q15 it says victim's uniform pants, and that is 
11 the officer; is that correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
The officer's uniform pants when you label 
14 as suspect and victim, what does that mean for you? 
15 A When we receive the evidence receipts that 
16 come with the evidence, they are, each case is 
17 assigned a victim or a suspect. I don't declare 
18 this, it was what was already like that when it came 
19 to the lab. 
20 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
Q 
From the police? 
Right. 
So it is not that you are determining who 
23 the victim is or who is the suspect is in this case? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No. 
So you have the officer's uniform pants

1 and you swab the left thigh, why did you do that? 
2 A Well, those swabs were actually taken by 
3 crime scene. 
4 Q I'm sorry, that's true, you didn't swab, 
5 they swabbed it. And did you have any information 
6 about why that was swabbed or you just tested it? 
7 A Well, all I knew was that there was 
8 possible blood on the officer's pants. So they did 
9 swab that to find out whose blood that was. 
10 Q Okay. And then there was swabs from the 
11 interior left front door of vehicle number 108, 
12 which is Q18? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Okay. And then you also received swabs of 
15 the officer's weapon; is that correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Now, in Q19, which is the weapon, it says 
18 blood was presumptively detected. Quantity was not 
19 sufficient for confirmatory testing. What does that 
20 mean? 
21 A Well, I was able to do a presumptive test 
22 for blood, which is just the first step in our 
23 process of testing blood. Presumptive test, it is a 
24 sensitive test, but it is not specific. So it 
25 indicates that the substance you are testing for is

1 possibly there. In this case, blood, so that was 
2 positive. 
3 To do a confirmatory test, you need 
4 to actually take more of that sample. Since there 
5 wasn't that much to begin with, I didn't want to use 
6 any more of a sample since there wasn't that much, 
7 it would have to go to DNA. 
8 So rather than, I guess, use up any 
9 more of a sample, I just indicated that confirmatory 
10 testing was impossible, but blood was presumptively 
11 detected. 
12 Q So in this case the DNA section could test 
13 further? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And you do say that the swabs were 
16 retained. You also tested Q20, is Wilson's blue 
17 uniform shirt, a swab was submitted? 
A No, I actually swabbed. 18 
19 Q You swabbed it, okay. So you swabbed the 
20 left side of his shirt and collar area. So you 
21 just, the whole shirt was submitted and you 
22 determined what to swab? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q Okay. And the uniform pants, is that the 
25 same thing in Q21 with the swabbing?
