4 this room that Michael Brown was trying to get away 
5 from the police officer? 
6 A Yes. 
7 And the police officer 
8 was pulling his shirt and his neck? 
9 A Yes. 
10 And you could tell that 
11 that far away and there's no possible way that there 
12 was a struggle and Michael Brown could have been 
13 frying to fight the police officer? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
A 
A 
No, that ain't what I saw. 
From that far away? 
Yes. 
So that leads me to 
18 another question. So you're saying that the police 
19 officer had his hand on Michael Brown's shirt? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
A 
A 
Yes. 
Yes. 
24 couldn't get away? 
25 A Yes. 
And his neck. 
And that is why he

3 A Yes. 
4 And then you saw the gun 
5 come out of the car? 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 And shoot Michael Brown 
8 in the chest? 
9 A Yes. 
10 So whatever hand's left, 
11 that leaves him one hand on Michael Brown to get the 
12 gun? 
13 
14 
15 
A 
A 
Yes. 
And then he shoots him? 
Yes. 
16 And it's at that point 
17 after Michael Brown is actually injured that he's 
18 able to get away? 
19 A Yes. 
20 Why was he not able to 
21 get away with all of his strength, non-injured but 
22 he is able to get away injured. If the police 
23 officer is that strong from a sitting position and 
24 Michael Brown is over him, why was he not able to 
25 get away when the police officer let go of one his

2 I mean, you got to understand, and I don't 
3 mean any disrespect. I know what you had to see was 
4 probably horrific, this is just not making sense to 
5 me. 
6 A Yeah, I got that 150 times. 
7 I'm not saying you're 
8 lying. 
9 A If none of my stuff is making any sense, 
10 like why do y'all keep contacting me, y'all keep 
11 bothering me. I didn't want to get involved in the 
12 first place. 
13 This is very important. 
14 A I understand that and that's what drew me 
15 to actually come in to say what I say and tell what 
16 I saw. 
17 Can I ask you one more 
18 question? Have you ever been in trouble with the 
19 police? 
20 A Yes, I've been to penitentiary and all of 
21 that. 
22 Okay. 
23 A So why would I bring myself here, why 
24 would I give myself a free ticket to jail if y'all

One quick 
4 question. I think at one point you mentioned the 
5 passenger in your car was a distraction. Can you 
6 maybe go into what was distracting? 
7 A She was yelling, screaming and jumping 
8 telling me to get away from there, which I wasn't 
9 going to pull off, you know, drive away from the 
10 scene. I don't know what was capable of happening 
11 me moving, so I just stood there. 
12 A lot of chaos and 
13 emotion. 
14 A Yes. 
15 Could that have distracted 
16 you a little bit from the scene in front of you? 
17 A Yes, sir. 
18 Did that go on for how 
19 long until you actually 
20 A Pulled up and parked, and that's when she 
21 proceeded, she was sitting, she was watching what 
22 was going on too. She proceeded to do what she was 
23 doing. I didn't see her until there was a bunch of 
24 police and people everywhere that she had came back 
25 with some of her and her folks.

2 When you 
3 drove past the officer there, and you have made a 
4 comment to the officer, I don't think I wrote it 
5 down correctly, could you tell me what you said to 
6 the officer again as you drove by? 
7 A Why the fuck you shoot him like that. 
8 Why the fuck you shoot him 
9 like that. At any time did you think, I mean, if 
10 you reportedly saw the officer shoot this guy in the 
11 head, that he might turn and just shoot you and your 
12 passenger? 
13 A Yes, I felt that, I felt that. But at the 
14 time I didn't, I mean, at the time I'm guessing he 
15 didn't realize what he put hisself into. So I 
16 expected him like he might shoot me too, but I 
17 wasn't to much worried about it. And that's why I

3 were big kids. 
4 Q And where were they walking, what street 
5 were they on? 
6 A They were on Canfield. 
7 Q And were they walking, if going down this 
8 way is east, were they walking east or were they 
9 walking that way? 
10 A West. I would say west because they was 
11 headed back towards the Northwinds Apartments. 
12 Q So they were headed towards the 
13 apartment 
14 A They wasn't headed towards West 
15 Florissant, they was headed away from West
