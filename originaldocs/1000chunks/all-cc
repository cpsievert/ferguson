17 whenever his arm, he was trying to like yank away 
18 and like his shirt was like, you know.

10 Is Michael Brown's head in the 
11 window a little bit is what you are saying? 
12 Yeah, I can't say, like he 
13 didn't go all the way into like that, but it was 
14 like a back and forth thing right there through the 
15 window. 
16 Okay. 
17 You never saw Michael 
18 Brown's hands go inside the window? 
19 No, I didn't. I can't say 
20 that they didn't, but I didn't see them. 
21 Is there a point you didn't 
22 see the entire thing where it is possible it could

15 have had eyes on the street the entire time? 
16 No, wherever I got out of
