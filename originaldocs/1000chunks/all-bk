1 way back I found that I had blood on the inside of 
2 my left hand and I already know I had it on the back 
3 of my right hand. And just from everything we have 
4 always been taught about blood, you don't want it on 
5 you, you don't touch it, you don't come in contact 
6 with it. 
7 And my original thought was that it 
8 was the glass had cut my wrist and cut my hand, 
9 which is why this hand was bleeding. And so 
10 thinking that I was cut with someone else's blood on 
11 me, I had to wash my hands. 
12 So I go directly to the bathroom. I 
13 actually washed them, went to the bathroom and then 
14 I looked, like I still had it like in my cuticles 
15 and stuff, so I washed my hands again. After I 
16 washed my hands, I go to our roll call room.

4 A I don't know, I did call him and say, I 
5 don't know who is going to drive your car later, but 
6 I had blood on my hands. You might want to tell 
7 them to wipe down the steering wheel or just be

24 so, and he could have sweat on it. When I took it 
25 out, I also saw blood on it.

24 would have no other contact with anybody and it 
25 could be as preserved as you could get.

I sat down and called for my attorney, who

4 be on his way. 
5 Officer came in, he gave me the 
6 card for the application for the Fraternal Order of 
7 Police. I said, I already called them. 
8 He said, would you like to tell me 
9 what happened so I can tell the media? I said, no, 
10 I don't want to talk right now. 
11 Lieutenant came in, he's 
12 actually my lieutenant who was off that day. He 
13 came in and said, has anybody told you what's 
14 happening? I said, I don't really know anything 
15 that's going on there. I left the scene pretty much 
16 right after. 
17 He said St. Louis County is 
18 investigating. I said okay, and then he left. 
19 And then right after he left, 
20 Ferguson Fire Department and EMS from Christian

4 They asked if I lost consciousness? 
5 I said, no. 
6 My vision was blurry? 
7 I said, no. 
8 Asked if I needed to go to the

10 I said, no, not right now.

4 Q Okay. And those photos that we looked at 
5 a minute ago were you at the hospital, correct? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q And then what happened after that? 
8 A At the hospital we did the interview. And 
9 when I went to the hospital, I didn't wear my 
10 uniform shirt, I took that off and my vest off, left 
11 it at the station, left my duty belt at the station. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Did someone tell you to do that? 
Yeah, and I felt more comfortable too 
14 because I obviously can't wear my gun, and I don't 
15 want to be in uniform after all of this without it. 
16 So I took the shirt off, just my 
17 undershirt, my pants, my boots, go to the hospital. 
18 While waiting to be treated in the waiting room, not 
19 in the waiting room, in the actual hospital room, 
20 Detective began his interview and then stopped 
21 as needed for nurses, whoever came in. They took

2 Q With two. And why didn't you say anything 
3 about asking again, what was that description of the 
4 two involved in the larceny, did you ask for any 
5 other details to insure in your own mind that maybe 
6 these, you know, were these the guys? 
7 A No, because my initial focus was just to 
8 get the information out that I was there. Have the 
9 other car respond and then get to that. My whole 
10 goal was to just stall until someone got there. 
11 Q Well, you've made previous statements 
12 about that, this incident, and one being initially 
13 to Sergeant 
A Uh-huh. 14 
15 Q Would you say that was kind of a brief, 
16 not a lot of detail statement, would that be fair to 
17 say? 
18 A The one on scene? 
19 Q On scene. 
20 A Yeah, it was very brief. 
21 Q And then you talked to 
22 Detective ? 
23 A Correct. 
24 Q At the hospital. And that was a little 
25 more detailed, would that be fair to say?

Q Did you tell 7 that when you 
8 saw him with his left hand reaching back and he made 
9 the statement here, hold these or whatever, that you 
10 saw what was in his hand? 
11 A I had saw the flash of them going back 
12 behind him. 
13 Q So you didn't see at that point what was 
14 in his hand? 
15 A I could see the red and white wrapper of a 
16 Cigarillo in his hand. 
17 Q Okay. Just so I can be sure I'm 
18 understanding you, did you see that they were 
19 Cigarillos or did you assume they were Cigarillos? 
20 A I assumed they were Cigarillos at that 
21 point. I saw that they were in his right hand 
22 before the contact was made. 
23 Q But you didn't notice as his hand, his 
24 right hand comes in the vehicle, and initially 
25 contacts your face, you don't notice that he has

1 these packages or package with red and white 
2 wrappers, you don't see them as he is hitting you? 
3 A No, because I had shielded myself and I 
4 believe I even closed my eyes. 
5 Q Did you ever grab ahold, you said that you 
6 grabbed ahold of his right hand at some point? 
7 A It was like his forearm, it was this area.

And what were you doing when you grabbed 
12 ahold of his right forearm? 
13 A Trying to move him and somewhat control 
14 him so I could get out of the car. 
15 Q Were you ever pulling him to try to pull 
16 him into the vehicle? 
17 A No, I was trying to open my car door with 
18 my left hand and then hold onto him as I did so. 
19 Q So you've got your left hand, or what's 
20 holding his right hand?

Yes. 
And this is before you've gone for your 
Yes. 
The first shot you've described pretty, I 
6 guess, in detail. I think I understand the first 
7 shot. The second shot you said you kind of weren't 
8 looking, I guess? 
9 A Uh-huh. 
10 Q Where was your gun pointed? 
11 A His general direction. 
12 Q Was your gun above the level of the door 
13 frame? 
14 A I would say, yes. It had come up, it was 
15 not on my leg any more and my leg sits only that far 
16 away from the top of the window. So I remember 
17 doing it like this, having my gun up. 
18 Q And you said you saw a little puff of dust 
19 or dirt that you assume was where a projectile might 
20 have landed in the dirt; is that correct? 
21 
22

1 window, let's just say, was your gun totally inside 
2 the vehicle, partially out of the vehicle, or was 
3 your hand extended so that the gun was totally 
4 outside of your vehicle? 
5 A I don't know for sure, but it was my right 
6 hand with it and I was like this. So I don't know 
7 where it could have gone.

And you said you had turned your face 
Yes, ma'am. 
And at that point Michael Brown is not 
17 right up on the vehicle, is that fair to say? 
18 A No, this is when he is coming back at the 
19 vehicle. He is only about a foot away and then 
20 after the first shot hit him, he went down and kind 
21 of held his hip for a second and then he came back 
22 up and started to come back in the vehicle. And 
23 that's when I just went like this and I pulled the 
24 trigger.

A 
Q 
I don't recall. 
(By Ms. Whirley) You said you knew the 
4 area and you felt threatened in that area because 
5 there is violence and guns and everything, and that 
6 Michael Brown was being confrontational before the 
7 first blow, correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is there any reason why you didn't wait in 
10 the car until your backup came? 
11 A I thought I would be able to just stall 
12 until someone got there. I thought if I can get out 
13 of the car, I could maintain the distance that I 
14 need to maintain, they were close. I figure all I 
15 needed was 20 or 30 seconds and someone is going to 
16 be there. 
17 Q Right. So why wouldn't you stay in the 
18 car? 
19 A Because I had already been, my comfort 
20 zone is not to be sitting in the car talking to 
21 someone else. I wanted to be out of the car, that 
22 way if I need to run I can run.
