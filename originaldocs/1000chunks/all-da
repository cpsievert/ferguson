When I heard the gunshots, the same time 
16 I'm hearing the gunshots, I seen his head jerk back

18 and that's when after that he fell face first on the 
19 ground. 
20 Q Okay. And so what were his arms doing

2 the shooting stop, he fell on the ground.

4 did you see him move any more? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
And what did you next see? 
7 A Urn, at this time after he fell on the 
8 ground is when I called my girlfriend. I said, 
9 , someone just got killed out here, someone just 
10 got killed. 
11 At the time I'm thinking, I'm looking 
12 around. This is when I seen the young man run 
13 across the field here and I'm thinking someone just 
14 shot someone else or whatever. And it wasn't until 
15 I seen around three or four officers come from 
16 around the corner of this building is when I 
17 realized okay, that's when I say, the police 
18 just shot someone, the police just shot someone. 
19 Q But that was an assumption you were 
20 making, correct? 
21 A Yes. 
22 Q You didn't see the police officer shoot 
23 anybody? 
24 A No, I didn't see a police officer shoot 
25 anybody.

1 Q Why is it that you would assume the police 
2 officer shot somebody? 
3 A Urn, because I felt at this time I wasn't 
4 sure if Mike Brown had a weapon and anger at the 
5 police officer or threatened him, may have caused 
6 the police officer to shoot him. It is just me 
7 assuming that the police officer being that close to 
8 a shooting that fast, that it was conflict between 
9 them. 
10 Q I'm sorry. The fact that there were three 
11 police officers there very quickly, you drew that 
12 conclusion that it was a police officer involved 
13 shooting? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Or is it after when people were coming out 
16 and talking that you then learned that? 
17 A No, it was at that time. Like I said, I 
18 just assumed that it was a police shooting. 
19 Q Why wouldn't you think it was this guy 
20 because you said you saw him run after the shooting, 
21 right? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
In your mind you don't think man, that guy 
24 just shot somebody and run in the field?

Yes.

20 first called her name, that she got up and was able 
21 to look out the bedroom window and see anything.

13 they pulled off. 
14 You think they had a clear 
15 view of what? 
16 A I'm not sure how clear their view was, but 
17 they were down on the ground, probably had a better 
18 view than I did. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: Show us again on the map 
20 where they were?

22 the lot, one was about here and the other one was
