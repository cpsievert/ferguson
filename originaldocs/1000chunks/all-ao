Image Number 7, this is Mr. Michael Brown. 
24 Again, we can see the face and you can see the shirt 
25 that he was wearing, just a closer image of the face

1 and upper body. 
Q Okay. Number 8? 2 
3 A This is number 8. So we are looking at 
4 the right side of Mr. Michael Brown's face and you 
5 can see the shirt that he's wearing and you can see 
6 the right side of his face. 
7 Q Number 9? 
8 A This is Image Number 9. And this is 
9 predominantly, you know, this is the right side of 
10 the face here, the left side would be here off of 
11 the view of the picture. So you can see some of the 
12 injuries here to the right side of the face. 
13 Q Now, before I get too far ahead of 
14 ourselves here, do you have other images in this 
15 stack that better document the injury that you 
16 documented? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
So you haven't, in other words, you 
19 haven't cleaned him up? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No, that is correct. 
And at some point do you clean him up? 
Yes, I do. 
And is it easier to visualize the injuries 
24 after that? 
25 A That is true.

1 Q Okay. So we'll go through these and then 
2 we will talk about the injuries when we have the 
3 other photographs. And that is Number 9 is next, I 
4 think? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. This is Number 10. 
Yes, that's right. This one is Number 9, 
7 you've got Number 10 up there on the screen? 
8 A Yes. This is similar image to what I just 
9 showed. We are still looking at the right side of 
10 the face and what has been introduced here by the 
11 officer who is taking the photos. He has introduced 
12 a ruler, the ruler is important for scale in order 
13 to if you want to go back in time to say how big or 
14 how small things are, that's the purpose of the 
15 ruler that has been introduced into this picture. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Okay. And the next would be Number 11? 
So this image is flip flopped a little 
18 bit, mouth and the nose would be up here, the top of 
19 the head is here, we are still looking at the right 
20 side of the face and then you still have this ruler 
21 that has been introduced into the picture. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. Number 12? 
This is Image Number 12. Now, we're 
24 seeing a little bit more of the left side of the 
25 face, but still predominantly focused on the right

an injury here on the right side of the 
Number 14? 
This is Image Number 14. Similar to the 
that I just showed you. The only 
12 difference is the ruler has been inserted into the 
13 photograph for scale. So we are looking at the 
14 right side of the face, again, focusing on this 
15 wound. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Number 15? 
Image Number 15. Flipped upside down, but 
18 the mouth would be here, the top of the head is down 
19 here, once again focusing on the right side of the 
20 face depicting injuries. 
21 Image Number 16. So we're looking at 
22 the right side of the body, there was a similar 
23 image of this before, but the feet are down here, 
24 the head is up here, this is the right side of the 
25 body.

13 here, the head is up here, you have the right arm 
14 being extended kind of perpendicular in a 90 degree 
15 angle from the table. The hand is up here, the 
16 shoulder would be down there. And we have these 
17 wounds here near the forearm, this is the forearm. 
18

Q 
A 
Okay. Image Number 18, I believe? 
This is Image Number 18. This is the

21 that is what is being depicted at this point.

23 
Q

Number 19? 
This is Number 19. We are looking at, do 
24 you want me to just go through the picture or you

Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. I can just go back and pull them 
We can pull them out? 
Okay. 
And, Doctor, is it your habit when you 
14 begin to describe injuries, do you like start from 
15 the head and work your way down, or do you just pick 
16 a certain way to describe them? 
17 A Urn, my usual approach is, I kind of go in 
18 terms of more significant injuries to the least 
19 significant. So I typically will start with the 
20 things that look to me to be, you know, more 
21 immediately impactful to the life of an individual. 
22 So when I get to the situation where 
23 I have wounds of the arms and things of that nature, 
24 those would be further down in my report. That's my 
25 typical approach when I do cases.

1 Q Okay. So we've scene the photographs of 
2 the head and the side of the body, and now we are 
3 looking at injuries to the right arm? 
4 A To the arm, yes. So this is the right 
5 forearm and there is an injury right here where they 
6 introduce the ruler scale in this particular photo. 
7 This is Image Number 20. We're still 
8 looking at the right forearm and this is on that 
9 previous photo, that's the wound that you were 
10 seeing and this is a new wound here on the right 
11 forearm. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley. 
13 When you say the forearm, where are you speaking of? 
14 A The forearm, particularly is the region of 
15 your arm between your wrist and your elbow. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And those are two 
17 separate wounds did you say? 
18 A Yes, they are two separate wounds. There 
19 is one here and there is one here. 
20

MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) At some point we will

2 And the next Number is 21, I think, 21, yeah? 
3 A Yeah, 21, and similar photos to what you 
4 just saw, but there's rulers here. You still have 
5 that wound here on the forearm and then here is 
6 another one on the right forearm. 
7 Is this 22? 
Q Yeah. 8 
9 A This is Image 22. So we're backing up a 
10 little bit and it is kind of hard, I can see it on 
11 my picture, we will get a little bit closer. So the 
12 head of Mr. Michael Brown is here, this is still his 
13 right arm, and this is like his torso here. What 
14 I'm going to be focusing on there is a wound right 
15 here on the middle part of his upper right arm. 
16 There is a wound right here. 
17 
18 
Q 
A 
Number 23? 
This is Number 23. And this is a closer 
19 picture of the wound that I couldn't really show too 
20 well on the overhead projector, but this is the 
21 wound in question right here. So it is on the upper 
22 portion of his right arm, but it is on the inside 
23 portion of the arm, medial. 
24 
25 A 
MS. WHIRLEY: That's the medial.

Close to that. 
This is Image Number 24. This is 
5 just the same picture again, but you see the ruler 
6 inserted for scale and this is the wound. 
7 This is Image Number 25, so the head 
8 of Mr. Michael Brown is here, the hand, the right 
9 hand is out here, this is the shoulder area and we 
10 are looking at the medial or kind of the inner 
11 aspect of the right arm, but what I'm focusing on 
12 right here there's another wound right here in the 
13 bicep region on the right arm. And then there is 
14 also a tattoo here on the forearm that reads Big 
15 Mike.

1 Mr. Michael Brown's head is here and there is a

3 So here, and specifically this region 
4 would be, we call it the ventral surface or anterior

17 portion of the right arm. When I say the upper 
18 portion of the right arm, I'm talking from the elbow 
19 to the shoulder. So where your bicep would be and 
20 this is a different portion of the right arm, but 
21 there's a different identifying tattoo here.

30?

3 A Image 31. So now we are looking, the 
4 shirt has been raised, we are still looking at the 
5 right sides of the body. So over here on the right 
6 lateral side of his chest, lateral is to the 
7 outside, you have a wound right here and that's the 
8 main thing that I'm focusing on at this point. 
9 So this would be 32. This is just a 
10 closer up view of that wound that I just showed you 
11 previously here on this lateral part of the right 
12 chest. And this is the nipple on right side. 
13 Q 33, it should be? 
14 A Image Number 33. The only thing different 
15 in this photo is, the ruler has been introduced per 
16 scale. Still looking at the same wound I just 
17 showed you. 
18 This will be Image Number 34. So 
19 here is Mr. Michael Brown's head, the shirt has been 
20 raised up further in this particular situation. 
21 That previous wound that I was just showing you was 
22 down here, there is a new wound here on the, kind of 
23 the upper part of right chest, and that's what I'm 
24 focused on right now, a different wound?

1 A This is a close-up view of that wound that 
2 I showed you on the upper part of that right chest. 
3 Q 36. 
4 A Image 36. The only difference is a ruler 
5 has been introduced per scale and there is also a 
6 wound out here, this is like an abrasion here on the 
7 right side of the chest. So there is two things of 
8 interest here and here. 
9 Image 37. We have switched over to 
10 Mr. Michael Brown's left arm and what, so his head 
11 is here, this is the left side of his body, this is 
12 the left arm and left hand that is still bagged with 
13 a brown paper bag. And there's an injury here on 
14 left forearm as well as there is a tattoo right next 
15 door. 
16 So this close-up image of the left 
17 forearm showing that injury that I just mentioned as 
18 well as the identifying tatoo. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Just for the record, that was Image 38. 
Image 39. Only thing different is the 
21 introduction of the ruler, still showing that injury 
22 on left forearm as well as the identifying tattoo. 
23 Now, 
24 you are classifying this as an injury rather than an 
25 wound, any significance to that?

2 keeping things consistent once I get to one place, 
3 but injury and a wound, they are similar. But 
4 eventually when I get to the point I will be able to

7 those out for you guys so you won't be confused.

9 Thank you. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) At this point you are 
11 documenting any injuries, no matter how they 
12 occurred? 
13 A Or defects. They are all kind of the same 
14 thing. There are things that is happening to the 
15 body that he wasn't born with, so.

22 we? I probably handed it back to you. I thought 
23 you would want it.

4 or the back side of the hand after the bag has been 
5 removed. 
6 This is 42. Now, I'm flipping back 
7 over to the other side of the body and this is going 
8 to be his right hand and the bag has been removed 
9 and here you can see an injury. 
Q I think 43? 10 
11 A Yes, 43. Image 43. This is the back side 
12 of the right hand and this is the, you know, the 
13 right forearm, right hand, this is after the bag has 
14 been removed from the hand.

16 of the injury to the right hand and this is the

19 are looking at.

21 palmar surface of the hand. This is the right hand, 
22 this is the thumb and this is the particular area of 
23 interest, there is an injury.

25 is the introduction of a ruler. We are still

1 looking at the right hand looking at that surface 
2 where this injury is. 
3 This is 47. So in terms of getting a 
4 different take on the hand and the injury, the hand 
5 has been cleaned off at this point. So I have 
6 removed some of that blood and material that was 
7 stuck to the hand. So this is a cleaner image of 
8 the hand after the bag has been removed and after it 
9 has been kind of cleaned off and we are still 
10 looking at the palmar surface or ventral surface or 
11 front surface of the right hand. 
12 Before 
13 you washed the hand, you collect under his nails or 
14 whatever it is he has gunpowder or skin? 
15 A A good question. The question raised was, 
16 before I am starting to wash or clean the hand, do I 
17 do any type of forensics or other biological 
18 evidence from the hands, and I do. 
19 Once the bags are removed, they are 
20 documented with pictures and in this particular 
21 case, I did do scraping underneath the nails to get 
22 material which is then submitted for analysis. And 
23 I also took fingernail clippings from both hands, 
24 which is submitted for evidence. 
25 And the actual clipper that I

1 actually used to remove the finger nails, that is 
2 also submitted as evidence. So all of those things 
3 are done before the hand has been altered or washed. 
4 And then at that point once I have taken the 
5 fingernail clippings and the scrapings, then I go 
6 ahead and wash the hands and then continue my 
7 process. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the clippers that you 
9 used to clip the nails, those are one use clippers, 
10 they are sterile, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then regarding, let's talk about that 
13 injury to the right palm. We have seen in the 
14 photograph that you have washed it off so you can 
15 get a better look at the injury, correct? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, at some point you took, you cut a 
18 piece of that wound out; is that right? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
That is correct. 
But you haven't done that at this point? 
No, I have not. 
22 Q What do you wash the wound with? 
23 A Usually just water, warm water and a towel 
24 or a rag, or sometimes they have like kind of like a 
25 bristle type brush to be able to scrub off that

A 
Q 
Water from the sink. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. So now back to 
14 the image that you last showed? 
15 A We are at 48 now. So this is still the 
16 right hand, the hand has been cleaned, it is just a 
17 closer view of that injury to the palmar surface of 
18 the right hand. 
19 This is Image 49. So only thing 
20 different, a ruler has been introduced for scale. 
21 So this is Image 50 and now we are 
22 back on the left side of the body. And this is the 
23 left hand and that's that wound or injury I was 
24 showing you guys earlier. I'm trying to focus on 
25 the thumb here, there is a little abrasion there.

1 Q Now, let me ask you, let me put this back 
2 up here. We see the position of the arm and the 
3 wrist and the hand is bent.

5 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Is that being held in that position or is 
6 that the way the body is fixed? 
7 A Most likely some of it is me putting a 
8 little bit of tension onto the hand to be able to 
9 better see the particular injury that I'm looking 
10 for, but at the same time there is also particular 
11 ways that the body, it is called rigor mortis, the 
12 body will be kind of fixed in a certain position. 
13 So there is mixtures of kind of these two events 
14 happening at the same time. 
15 The natural fixation or rigor mortis 
16 of the body, plus me putting tension on it to get a 
17 better look at the injury that I'm trying to show in 
18 this photograph. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. So the next photo is? 
This is Image 51. So this is a close-up 
21 of that left hand and it is just this little injury 
22 right here. Technically it is an abrasion, this is 
23 what I'm focusing on right here.

51? 
This should be 52.

Image 52. Still showing that little 
3 injury/abrasion there on the hand. And the only 
4 difference is the introduction of the ruler for 
5 scale. 
6 This is 53. So we are still looking 
7 at the left hand and I've, I'm starting to pull this 
8 fifth finger or the pinky finger on the left hand, 
9 I'm trying to expose a little area of discoloration 
10 on that hand. 
11 Showing you 54. So this is that 
12 fifth finger, that pinky finger on the left hand and 
13 this is this little area of discoloration, that's 
14 all I'm focusing on in this photo. 
15 Q Just so we know, did you determine was 
16 that an injury, that little area of discoloration?

Okay. 
This is 55. 
It is getting tired. 
There it is. That's just that little area 
22 of discoloration on the left hand right here by the 
23 pinky finger. For anatomical purposes, this is the 
24 dorsal surface of the finger, the posterior or back 
25 side of the finger.

3 the dorsal or the back side of the left hand and 
4 there's an injury right here.

Yes, I do. 
Okay. 
As previously mentioned, this is just a 
10 closer, I'm sorry, Image 57. This is a close-up 
11 view of that previous abrasion here on the dorsal 
12 aspect of the posterior of the back side of the left 
13 wrist and there's an abrasion there. 
14 Same image again of that abrasion on 
15 the left wrist, back side posterior, just only thing 
16 different is the introduction of a ruler.

Okay. 
There is another one that I have to 
Okay. But at this point now, you remove 
6 the clothing? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q All right. And is the clothing seized and 
9 packaged by a police officer? 
10 A Yes, the clothing is seized and packaged 
11 as evidence to the officer. 
12 Q Now, let me ask you this. At some point 
13 is his clothing searched while he is in the morgue. 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, it is. 
And who does that? 
Usually the morgue attendant will search 
17 the clothing.

19 
20 
Q 
A 
Q 
Were you present when that was done? 
I do not remember. 
Okay. And so if there was anything that 
21 was inside the clothing or attached to the clothing, 
22 that would have been removed by the morgue 
23 attendant? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And so who actually removed the clothing

1 from the body? 
2 A 
3 Q And is the clothing removed by cutting it 
4 off? 
5 A Urn, it depends, but in this situation it 
6 was just removed normally as you and I would take 
7 off our clothing. The only time the clothing is cut 
8 is if it is too difficult to remove it, but in this 
9 situation the clothing was not too difficult to 
10 remove, so it was not cut. 
11 Q Okay. And after the clothing is removed 
12 and that's seized and packaged by someone else, any 
13 items that were inside the clothing is taken care of 
14 by someone else, do you then clean up the body? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes, yes, I do. 
And so this next image, which I can't 
17 remember what number that is?

Q 
We are on 59. 
Okay. This is now the body after the 
20 clothing is removed and the body has been cleaned of 
21 excess blood and so forth, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
It is the best possible attempt to do so. 
Okay. Now, let me ask you this. I don't 
24 know if I'm jumping back or forward here, but 
25 initially in your examination, I don't know if you
