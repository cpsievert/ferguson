All right. So let's see. I think I've

Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
What does CAD stand for? 
That's Computed Aided Dispatch. 
What is CAD, what is the CAD system? 
That's when we have calls, we have a ITI 
19 system it is called. And what they do, the call 
20 will come out, dispatchers use that for the 
21 reporting. The officer can write in there what they 
22 did. There is a report that doesn't need to be 
23 taken, an official report, they can put, it is like 
24 a little entry in there for notes. What he did when 
25 he was on the call, that way that's always in there.

And so the dispatcher when she takes a

7 something.

Uh-huh. 
And then she would have to separately

A

13 this call? 
14 A 
15 Q 
Yes. 
So she puts some kind of notes related to 
Yes. 
And then that information, that CAD 
16 information, does that show up in the officer's 
17 computers in their cars? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, it does. 
And then the officers can also enter 
20 things in the CAD system, correct?

Yes, they can. 
And if the officer does, does the

Q 
They can't change somebody else's entry? 
No, ma'am. 
How about dispatch, can she change it? 
No, ma'am. Only a supervisor can do that. 
Now, let's talk about internal clock. We 8 
9 talked about this you and I. So when a call is 
10 received by an officer into dispatch, there's a 
11 clock in dispatch that the dispatchers use, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And it is physically a digital clock that 
14 sits there, correct? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And is that clock the accurate time? 
Yes, ma'am. 
I don't even know what the accurate, there 
19 is some kind atomic, I was going to say nuclear. 
20 Some type atomic clock in some mountain state some 
21 place, so that clock is the exact time, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So sometimes when the dispatcher 
24 responding, or involved in a call she will actually 
25 call out the time 11:36?

Yes, ma'am. 
She's getting that from her clock? 
Yes. 
Now, when a dispatch call comes in and 
5 might be answered by the dispatcher, does the 
6 computer give that call a date and time? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And is that the same time that might be on 
9 the call clock that the dispatcher is looking at? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. 
Is it ever off, have you had occasions to 
12 see that those two times are not the same? 
13 A Sometimes they do get unsynchronized. The 
14 main problem we have is the 911 system, it is not 
15 synchronized. 
16 Q So let's talk about the 911 system. I 
17 think you already said Ferguson does their own 911

Yes. 
Those calls also have a date and time

7 the past? 
8

A 
Q 
Yes. 
And how many minutes have they been off in 
I've seen it as much as 21 minutes off. 
Okay. So if you are, would it be fair to 
10 say then that if you're going to look back at your 
11 911 calls and the record of the calls, the time 
12 that's listed for those calls on the computer are 
13 not necessarily accurate? 
14 A Right. 
15 Q Okay. And you also said that it might be 
16 that the actual dispatch call radio traffic, that 
17 might be not in sync with the actual clock that the 
18 dispatcher is looking at?

3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q Now, you testified that each officer has a 
5 call number assigned to him? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q And depending on the day or the shift that

13 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm setting this up 
14 because we are going to hear some calls and I've got 
15 a transcript and the officers are identified by 
16 their number like 21, 22, 24, okay. 
17 So you and I and your dispatcher sat 
18 down and we went over these calls this morning and I 
19 actually made some changes on the transcript as you 
20 would be telling me oh, that's so and so.

1 their lifeline. 
2 We do also do radio checks every 
3 Sunday on the midnight shift for alert tone test to 
4 make sure that the alert tone is still working. 
5 We also do that with cars too, so 
6 that's all done on a Sunday evening when they're 
7 somewhat quiet. 
8 Each officer that's working will have 
9 to hit their alert tone so we know that walkie is 
10 working then. If it isn't, we know to take it out 
11 and get them another walkie and get it repaired. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: So they do that on a weekly 
13 basis? 
14 A Yes, ma'am, it's every Sunday night on the 
15 midnight shift.

17 part on knowing how to communicate for your life? 
18 A Yes, it is. 
19 It 
20 doesn't matter what radio frequency that you are on 
21 if you hit that alert button?

4 A Yes, ma'am. There's a screen up in front 
5 of each dispatcher. It's a radio screen and up in

8 MS. WHIRLEY: When that button is hit,

3 MS. WHIRLEY: Just to hear what's going on 
4 because they are not responding to the calls 
5 generally? 
6 A No, huh-uh. But that's put into a scan

8 switch to that channel. It is automatically 
9 scanning that channel. So if there's a transmission 
10 on that channel it will come up. But if dispatch 
11 wants to get ahold of them, it will supersede that 
12 channel and take over. 
13 So it is on a priority button. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So if you are 
15 scanning the County's RIOT channel, that's not going 
16 to interfere with your dispatcher communicating with 
17 you or you communicating with your dispatcher? 
18 
19 
A Not at all. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Does Ferguson have its own 
20 RIOT channel? 
21 
22 
A No, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Any problems, you may 
23 have answered this, I'm not certain. Any problems 
24 with the walkies, the walkie-talkies call and 
25 receiving calls at Canfield Green? You mention kind

1 of dead zone, or could be. I wasn't sure what that 
2 meant. 
3 A Some walkies have a problem with it. You 
4 have got to remember Canfield used to be a golf 
5 course, a lot of hills and a lot of terrain, 
6 different terrain in there. 
7 If you're standing a certain way, 
8 that walkie will not get out. Then if you just move 
9 2 feet over, you have got transmission. It is just 
10 a weird, the way the terrain is. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Do you have your 
12 officers complaining who work in Canfield Green, 
13 hey, I'm not getting my calls or I can't send you my 
14 location. 
15 A Yes. We have a few. It mainly happens in 
16 one sector, not in four sector. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: And the sector that you're 
18 talking about is sector four? 
19

1 we have what they call a Dellwood repeater, it is 
2 right there by the Dellwood Civic Center. It is on 
3 a separate tower. If that isn't working correctly, 
4 you will have problems getting out in one sector. 
5 We go all the way to Old Halls Ferry and 270. If 
6 you're on a walkie-talkie on an accident, you won't 
7 hear that officer. Now the other officer assisting 
8 him can, he can relay the message. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: On channel three, which is 
10 what I think Darren Wilson may have been on; is that 
11 correct or do you know? 
12 
13 
A I don't know. 
MS. WHIRLEY: You said on your channel 
14 three, the dispatch can hear and receive, right? 
15 
16 
A Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: On channel three. Can they 
17 transmit too. 
18 A Yes, I'm sure. Yeah. That's a North 
19 County fire channel. So they'll need to be able to 
20 transmit with our fire department. 
21 
22 A 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
When our fire department goes 10-8 from a 
23 call, a fire call, they'll transmit on that. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: So that channel was 
25 monitored all the time?

Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is it recorded also? 
Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So if an officer is on 
5 channel three and asks for assistance and puts out 
6 shots fired, it should be recorded somewhere? 
7 A You're not going to hear it, it is receive 
8 only. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: It is receive only from that 
10 officer? 
11 A From the channel. The officer will not be 
12 able to transmit.

14 that. When you hit that channel we're going to hear

You are going hear that tone. 
MS. WHIRLEY: The purpose of the tone is 
To move to a different channel that is 
20 transmittable. It is a safety feature. It is in 
21 the walkie-talkies actually. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: Just real quick. 
23 Sergeant, I had told you that there was a 
24 call perhaps from Ferguson that did not recorded by 
25 dispatch, correct?
