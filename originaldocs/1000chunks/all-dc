Then I started with the St. Louis County

4 Q How many years have you been with the St. 
5 Louis County Crime Lab? 
6 A One and a half years. 
7 Q And so do you work as a chemist or a

1 under an accreditation. 
2 Q All right. And so what, without sounding 
3 too obvious or moronic I would say, could you 
4 describe what chemistry is, the field of forensic 
5 chemistry? 
6 A Forensic chemistry is in the drug 
7 chemistry, we generally it's powders, liquids, 
8 residues, plant material, pharmaceuticals, that we 
9 analyze and determine if they have controlled 
10 substances in them or not. 
11 Q What about other types of things like, for 
12 example, poisons, would you analyze a liquid to 
13 determine if it had any kind of poisonous material? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Not me, no. 
So if say there was a substance that might 
16 be seized in a criminal investigation and it was 
17 suspicious that it was arsonic, is that something 
18 that you would examine and test? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Not me. 
Okay. So your field is strictly regarding 
21 the examination and testing of substances to 
22 determine whether or not they have contained 
23 controlled substances? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And controlled substances are drugs?

A 
Q 
Page 84 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And then everything from 
3 prescription drugs to marijuana, to street drugs; is 
4 that right? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so did you receive an evidence item in 
7 order for you to examine in relation to a St. Louis 
8 County investigation that is hopefully, or will be 
9 documented under Report Number 2014-43984? 
10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What was it that you received to analyze. 
I received a bag that actually I believe 
13 was in a plastic container and then a plastic bag 
14 containing a plant material substance. 
15 Q Okay. In general now, let's talk about 
16 how you get evidence items. How is it that they 
17 come to you? 
18 A They are submitted, in this case since 
19 this is, this is submitted as a county, St. Louis 
20 County case. So it goes through property control 
21 division and then property control brings it up to 
22 the crime lab. 
23 So it gets entered into the computer, 
24 the evidence is then placed into a vault and then --
25 Q A vault in the crime lab?

Yeah. 
Okay. 
And actually, that's normal procedure. 
4 This one, I remember that it went through one of my 
5 co-workers. He was getting ready to work the case 
6 and I asked him, oh, what do you got there? And he 
7 goes, well, this is a case that needs to be worked, 
8 a rush case, do you want to do it? And he asked the

supervisor, I said, that's fine, I can rush this 
case. 
And he said, let me call the 
supervisor and the supervisor said yeah, if 
wants to do the case, that's fine, so I did it. 
Q Now, when you began as a chemist or 
15 forensic chemist with the County Crime Laboratory, 
16 was there like an on-the-job training period or 
17 probationary period? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
And how long did that last? 
Normally it would last six months and 
21 probation is one year, but since I had training 
22 through the Highway Patrol, it really was about two 
23 months here. 
24 Q Okay. And so you were as qualified to 
25 examine this evidence item as any other forensic
