11 the time that you are examining this shirt and

And a presumptive test will show you what? 
It is a two-part test. Once you moisten 
8 your two swabs with the first agent and then swab 
9 this area, you remoisten it with a second reagent. 
10 If it turns a bright color of pink, it is 
11 presumptive for blood. 
12 It's not positive because that's 
13 what -- we can't do that, but I did not get a 
14 positive reaction. And based on the color and my 
15 training and experience I was pretty confident at 
16 the time that it wasn't blood, however, if I'm going 
17 to be able to testify to the results of that, then I 
18 have to do a presumptive blood test. I can't just 
19 automatically say, well, that's not blood. 
20 So that's why we confirm this and did 
21 not have a positive reaction with phenolphtaleine. 
22 Phenolphtaleine, which is as I explained, a two-part 
23 presumptive test. I did not get a positive 
24 reaction, so it was not blood.

3 station, did he ultimately remove the pants for you 
4 to examine and photograph? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
He did. 
Is that what we're seeing in this image? 
These are the image of his unform pants 
8 that are displayed. Officer Wilson or Darren Wilson 
9 did tell me that there was blood on his pants. It 
10 is easier to see when you look at these photographs 
11 at your convenience, but my orange indicator is 
12 pointing to the area which did have red stains on it 
13 that was identified by Darren at the time of my 
14 investigation. 
15 So the pants were removed, he changed 
16 into other clothes, the pants were displayed just 
17 like his uniform shirt and for orientation purposes, 
18 and that is why I put that orange indicator in there 
19 so it draws your eye to the center of the photograph 
20 so you know what the focal point of that is. 
21 Q And so that would be on the left leg. Are 
22 we looking at the front or the back of his pants? 
23 A It is the front, it is his upper left 
24 thigh area.

11 that it was blood.

5 me, it was unloaded, placed in our processing area

24 has flexible mirrors that was an area of concern.

1 door. I had already been informed that Darren 
2 Wilson had fired a round through the door, so I had 
3 a certain defect in the driver's door. 
4 I was requested to fingerprint the 
5 outside of the door and also swab for potential DNA 
6 sources on the top edge of the door where the window 
7 comes out of the door there is a rubber strip there. 
8 And also there was some red stains, which we 
9 believed to be blood on the inside of the driver's 
10 door. So all of that was completed in my 
11 investigation.

17 you folks to see, so please look at it later when

2 A No, ma'am. That's not a conducive surface 
3 for me to get a decent fingerprint evidence. It is 
4 rough, there could be some other foreign materials 
5 on it when it was cleaned. I really need a decent

5 Q Now, starting with Image Number 43, can 
6 you describe what you're seeing and what those 
7 things are on the edge of the car. Let's do this. 
8 A As asked, the exterior of 
9 that is processed with fingerprint powder. Once I 
10 developed latent fingerprint evidence, then those 
11 lifts are removed by placing lifting tape on there. 
12 We also photograph those latent lifts in place and 
13 our system is that there are always, we always use 
14 letters on latent lifts and we try to use numbers on 
15 evidence. 
16 So every one of those is numbered A 
17 through E. and they're always photographed in place. 
18 This was the area that I developed 
19 latent fingerprint evidence and so based on the 
20 information that I received, that's where we 
21 determined to be the best area that they were 
22 concerned about as far as retrieving latent 
23 fingerprint.

1 of the vehicle, what do you do with that tape in 
2 order to preserve it? 
3 A They're placed on what's referred to as a 
4 liftback. In essence, it is a bright white card. 
5 So you would have contrast or latent fingerprint 
6 examiners can compare that to known or ink 
7 impressions. Be it from other police officers, 
8 Darren Wilson, anyone. 
9 That's how they make those 
10 comparisons. 
11 Q You're not the person who makes those 
12 comparisons, correct? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am, I'm not a latent examiner. 
So your job is to search for areas, make a 
15 determination of where you might find some latent 
16 fingerprint or palm print perhaps? 
17 
18 
19 that? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And then you did visualize it by putting 
Develop those with fingerprint powder. 
And then lift them off the surface? 
Correct. And then they're submitted to 
23 our fingerprint unit. 
24 Q Okay. And how many lifts did you do in 
25 this case?

A I had prints A through E. 1 
2 Q Did you process any other part of the 
3 vehicle for fingerprints? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
No, I did not. 
I'm going to show you your Image Number 
6 44. Can you describe what we see in there? 
7 A Once we had photographed the outer part of 
8 the interior door panel, in order to retrieve that 
9 projectile, that door panel was removed. 
10 Also when that projectile went 
11 through there, it also damaged part of the inner 
12 door skin. And also went through and struck the 
13 outside of the door, which I believe another 
14 detective had photographed. It looks like a bump. 
15 So once I retrieved that projectile 
16 and there is some other documentation there also in 
17 the bottom of this, so we have overall view of it. 
18 All of that glass I had to sift through in order to 
19 retrieve that projectile. 
20 So to tie this into a photographic 
21 series, we take an overall view of the door, meaning 
22 the source of where we recover the projectile from. 
23 We orange triangle by indicator in that pile of 
24 glass is where I retrieved the projectile after 
25 scooping all of this out from inside of the door.

2 and further sequencing. 
3 Q So when you say you scooped the glass out, 
4 was the glass inside this area down?

A 
Q 
7 panel? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
All down in there, yes. 
Down in this area, but behind this metal 
Right. 
So you had to actually scoop it out with a 
10 tool or with your hands? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
My hands. 
As you scoop it out, are you just dumping 
13 it on the ground then or does it fall on the ground 
14 there? 
15 A No, I'm taking out small handfuls by small 
16 handfuls. I don't want to lose anything else, maybe 
17 this projectile fragmented, maybe there are sharp 
18 edges to it. So we're very cognizant as far as 
19 trying to retrieve as much evidence as we can. 
20 The good thing for me as an 
21 investigator is the projectile is pretty much 
22 intact. So we didn't have a lot of small, minute 
23 pieces of metal that were not directly related to 
24 that projectile. 
25 So as I'm doing it, I'm carefully

1 putting in a pile, going through every handful. 
2 When I finally retrieved, determine that it was a 
3 projectile. It is left right there and we start our 
4 sequence as far as taking photographs. 
5 Q So showing you your Image Number 45, what 
6 do you see in that image? 
7 A This is an overall view of where that 
8 projectile, once it went through that plastic door 
9 panel entered the interior metal skin of that door. 
10 Is just an overall view of it. The 
11 focal point in the center of the photograph will be 
12 right about here, which you will see when you get 
13 further into the seats.

15 
Q 
A 
Image 46? 
This is a closer view of it. The area of 
16 concern is right here. (indicating) 
17 Q And so a little clearer, actually, looking 
18 at the image with your own eyes. 
19 I guess from the very top of it, 
20 maybe at the one or two o'clock position, there is a 
21 defect on the metal? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. Showing you Number 47? 
That's a closer view with the scale next 
25 to it. The area of concern, again, is this upper

portion right here. (indicating) 
Q So when you could see the car in your 
3 garage, could you see that defect that was on the 
4 outside of the door? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, it was pushed out or bowing out. 
And does the location of that defect 
7 correspond with where that mark, the defect was on 
8 the my of the insides of the door? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
I would say it is consistent. 
Okay. You didn't take any measurements to 
11 or anything to determine? 
12 
13 
14 48. 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
No, ma'am. 
Okay. All right. Showing you your Image 
This is a closer view, one of a series as 
16 far as we orientated originally as far as the 
17 source. The interior of the door, we have the pile 
18 of glass that I had gone through, the projectile 
19 with the orange indicator, and that was just a 
20 closer view of the same area with the indicator and 
21 projectile. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Image 49? 
This is a close-up view of it. Again, the 
24 indicator and the projectile recovered hasn't moved. 
25 It is just a closer view of it.

Right here. 
You recognize that as a spent projectile?

11 A It was packaged, marked and forwarded to 
12 our firearms examiner.
