2 Q And just to clarify because you talked 
3 about bullets passing through his lung. And I 
4 thought maybe I misunderstood. I thought one of the 
5 injuries to the lung was caused by the rib that 
6 punctured the lung? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q Was there more than one bullet know 
9 through the lung? 
10 A One bullet went through the lung, the 
11 other bullet struck the rib, the eighth rib, which 
12 is nearby, so your right lung is in three pieces. 
13 It has got an upper lobe, it's got a middle lobe and 
14 it's got a lower lobe. So the first, that bullet 
15 that's up here by the clavicle by the collar bone, 
16 that hit the upper part of the lung. 
17 So when that other bullet passes 
18 through and hits the eighth rib, it snapped it, it 
19 fracture it. So say this is a rib cage, your lung 
20 is sitting there, when it broke it, it snapped it to 
21 the inside and when it broke, the bone punctured 
22 that lower portion of the rib causing additional 
23 injuries to the lung. So the bullet itself didn't 
24 do it, but the bullet hit the bone and snapped and 
25 did puncture the wound.

Q

Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Sheila Whirley. Can you 
3 tell, is there any way to know how quickly he would 
4 have been incapacitated due to all of these injuries 
5 prior to the fatal shot? 
6 A That's going to be difficult, difficult to 
7 determine. It is just pure speculation. 
8 
9 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
I just 
10 need some clarification. The wound to the head, did 
11 you say that was a far distance? 
12 A That one is an indeterminate, so it is 
13 greater than 3 feet. 
14 It is greater than 3 feet? 
15 
16 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions about 
17 those wounds so far? 
18 The 
19 wounds to the top of the head, could he have been 
20 already falling forward? 
21 
22 
A It is possible. 
So let's say like the 
23 first wound he received, I know you said --
24 A What is the first one we are talking 
25 about?

1 Let's just say to the 
2 chest. 
3 A All right. 
4 Could that wound have 
5 like, I know you said that he could of still been 
6 mobile, could he have not been mobile as well? 
7 Could you just like get shot? 
8 A You can stop walking, that wound is not 
9 going to prevent you from using your legs. You've 
10 consciously chose to stop moving, you still would 
11 have the ability to move with sustaining a shot like 
12 that. It is not going to render you unconscious, 
13 that's the point I'm trying to make. The wound to 
14 the head, he's going to be unconscious, he can't 
15 move if he wants to. 
16 But you get hit here in the chest, 
17 you are going to have some time to be able to move 
18 around and it is depending on a variety of factors. 
19 How quickly you use blood. The main thing that will 
20 make you collapse is, once you block off that blood 
21 return, you've got maybe like 10 to 15 seconds of 
22 reserve of oxygen going to your brain before you 
23 pass out. 
24 So when you reach that critical 
25 level, each person is going to have a different

1 critical level with body masses, being different 
2 sizes, people have different kind of levels of blood 
3 reserve, different levels of volume. 
4 So someone smaller or bigger maybe 
5 last a little bit longer. Also the activity that 
6 you are doing before is also going to impact. Say, 
7 for instance, if you have been running and your 
8 heart was going really, really fast, you're going to 
9 pump blood out quicker as oppose to someone really 
10 calm, just kind of sitting there, you are not going 
11 to bleed as fast. So all of these factors play a 
12 role in determining how quickly you are going to be 
13 responsive or immobile. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. Let's go ahead 
15 and somewhat quickly if you can run through those 
16 other photos. If you go ahead and identify them and 
17 put them on what it says, what it shows abrasion? 
18 A This is 102, I believe. So this is his 
19 left arm, this is just showing a linear abrasion on 
20 the left arm. 
21 Q You characterize that before as being like 
22 a grazing wound? 
23 A I wouldn't say it is in that category. 
24 This one is some type of blunt force injury caused 
25 that. I wouldn't say it is necessarily a

1 projectile. The characteristic of it is different. 
2 You could have rubbed on something, it is hard to 
3 say. It is nonspecific, but it is not a classical 
4 graze wound like you saw on the bicep on the right 
5 arm or that graze wound. 
6 This is different. This is just an 
7 abrasion. It is not specific and I can't say what 
8 it is from. 
9 My thought was 
10 whether with glasses on, if you were able to tell if 
11 it was a clean cut? 
12 A That's something you can argue about, but 
13 the fact that it is so dry and, you know, it is kind 
14 of firm, it is kind of difficult to say is it a cut 
15 or incise wound. I can definitely say that is a 
16 superficial layer of skin has been rubbed off, but 
17 it is difficult to say was it a sharp or was it, you 
18 know, rubbing on some keys or who knows, a door, I 
19 don't know. It is kind of in between and it is 
20 difficult to specifically say what caused that. But 
21 there is definitely an injury there, the top part of 
22 the skin is gone. 
23 Thank you.

1 been choked? 
2 A Well, I would like to clarify for me. 
3 Strangulation is a better term, choking is 
4 different. 
5 Q Choking is like I got something, I

7 A Right, right. 
8 Q So you are right, so you've seen someone 
9 who has been strangled? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
What kind of injury would you see on 
12 someone who has been strangled? 
13 A Externally you may see abrasions from, you 
14 know, people have nails or whatnot and the rough 
15 nature of the event, you can create abrasions on the 
16 outside of the neck. You don't always see them, but 
17 you can. 
18 Then once you open the neck, when I 
19 do a dissection of the neck, you have multiple 
20 layers of soft tissue as well as muscle. 
21 If enough force is applied there, you 
22 can see hemorrhaging within the soft tissues of the 
23 neck and then also you have a bunch of structure 
24 within your neck called the hyoid bone can be 
25 fracture or injured. And in a strangulation, those

1 are some of the things I look for in the neck and 
2 situations where someone has been strangled or has 
3 an injury to the neck. 
4 Q In this case you found no injuries to his 
5 neck, correct? 
6 A Correct, correct. 
7 Q And I know when we are talking, when I say 
8 strangulation, I think of that as being like someone 
9 who is a cause of death, they are dead from 
10 strangulation, but people can be strangled, but then 
11 survive, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
13 Q And in some occasions, will you notice 
14 bruising to the neck?

Correct. 
But these are all photographs that are 
6 taken that day during your autopsy? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And in conclusion for today, were you able 
9 to determine within a reasonable degree of medical 
10 certainty the cause of death of Michael Brown? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, gunshot wound to the head and chest. 
Were you able to determine within a 
13 reasonable degree of medical certainty the manner of 
14 death of Michael Brown? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
The manner of death is homicide. 
So that would be homicide as opposed to a 
17 suicide or accidental or anything like that? 
18 A Correct. 
19 Q Homicide just means at the hands of 
20 another, it doesn't indicate there is any kind of 
21 criminal liability, that is a term that's used in 
22 forensic pathology, correct? 
23 
24 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody have any other 
25 questions about the autopsy or what he did in the

3 Can you 
4 tell me how many exit wounds there were?

A 
A 
I'd say three. 
How many entrance wounds? 
I don't include the graze wound as one of 
8 these things that is in between say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
9 6. 
10 And two graze wounds? 
11 
12 
A That's 8. 
Thank you. 
13 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And those again, those 
14 wounds, each of them is documented in your 
15 post-mortem examination report that I provided 
16 copies to the jurors and also is there any way that, 
17 do you have any opinion as to the order in which 
18 these gunshots were, these wounds were sustained on 
19 Michael Brown's body? 
20 A From what I do, the investigation is 
21 ongoing. There is things I'm privilege to. There 
22 is things I do know and things that can be shared 
23 with you later as the process goes on. 
24 In my opinion in terms of what I can 
25 say the wound to the hand has to occur at a time

1 when Michael Brown is close enough to the officer 
2 for that to have happened. So depending on the 
3 circumstances that you guys hear from what I know, 
4 there is a point in time where they are in close 
5 approximation to each other at the vehicle. 
6 In my opinion I feel that's the 
7 closest they are for it to happen from the 
8 circumstances that I know that that injury occurred. 
9 So that has to be early on in the event. In terms 
10 of the end of the event, the wound to the top of the 
11 head is going to be the last wound that he is going 
12 to receive. 
13 So in terms of the beginning part 
14 with the thumb wound and the part at the end, those 
15 two I can feel good about saying that I know when 
16 those happened, but the ones in between, it is to 
17 difficult to say. 
18 Q And given the entrance and exits of the 
19 wounds that you've described, and I know that we've 
20 said there is no entrance wounds on his back?

Or on his buttocks? 
Correct. 
Or on the back of the his legs? 
Correct.

And then there is some wounds to the

A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then the wounds to his arms are kind

A 
Q 
Right. 
Any way of telling what position that body 
10 was in when those wounds were sustained? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
Given that they're arms, it just depends 
13 on where his arms were? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And in relation to where the gun was? 
Correct. But I can say to sustain wounds 
17 to the chest, the chest is fixed, those with the 
18 arms it can be in a number of positions. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any other 
20 questions. Does anybody else have anything they 
21 want to cover today? 
22 Just one. He did have an 
23 entrance wound to the back of his --

from the 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So if someone in this 
and it is a gunshot wound, the gun could 
fired from behind them? 
Correct. 
Someone in this position, the gunshot come 
front of them, correct? 
Correct. 
Or in this position, or in this position? 
Correct. 
It is difficult to say, correct, or 
13 impossible to say? 
14 A Correct. 
15 The reason 
16 that you are saying most likely the last is because 
17 the wounds to the chest and the wounds to the arm he 
18 would of had to be somewhat upright to have those 
19 somewhat? 
20 A What's more of an issue he could still be 
21 mobile, he could be moving around, once he got this, 
22 he's going to be unconscious. 
23 He's going to be down and 
24 there is no way to get to his chest if he were down. 
25 A Right, that is true.

14 As you are doing your 
15 exam, like you said before, you are speaking, right,

2 A As I am going through the autopsy, I want 
3 pictures of this, I need a picture of this, this is 
4 important I think, I need that, that's the extent of 
5 the talking. I'm not, the generation of this 
6 report, this is happening once I complete 
7 everything, I go back to my office with all of my 
8 notes and then I do this on my Dictaphone after 
9 everything is done. 
10 They were there also, they 
11 were present also when the x-rays were going on? 
12 A X-rays, no, they came, once you saw that 
13 picture when he's out of the bag, he has his clothes 
14 on and the placard, that's when they were showing up 
15 and that's when it started. The x-rays are done 
16 before, the process of the body being processed for 
17 me to do my examination, that's happening. 
18 Okay. 
19 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And, in fact, some of 
20 the x-rays, the x-rays are done with his clothing 
21 on, correct? 
A Correct. 22 
23 Q And like in some x-rays you can see the 
24 belt buckle on his pants and so forth? 
25 A Correct.

The zipper of his pants, I can't remember?

X-rays are done before the clothes are

A Correct. 
I think this 
7 might be the last question. So in essence, while 
8 you are doing your examine and you have the 
9 onlookers or the people that watch, they take the 
10 photographs, no one actually knows what you are 
11 going to put into your report until your report is 
12 done, is that correct? 
13 A Right. 
14 Thank you. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Just then for the 
16 record, I know this, your report was done in, I 
17 would say in my experience with the Medical
