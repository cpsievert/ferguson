13 measure against every testimony here is what we know 
14 to be forensics because that is irrefutable. 
15 It is not he was at this perspective or 
16 that perspective, but here is how he changes. We 
17 know whether or not Michael Brown was shot at point 
18 blank range in the head based on that, yes or no, we 
19 know that. 
20 We are here today to tell you what you are 
21 saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on 
22 the evidence. 
23 And that's just an example. 
24 Virtually everything that you told the FBI on 
25 August 13th doesn't match up with the evidence,

So you're telling me he 
3 didn't get shot in the head at point blank range? 
4 What we are telling you is 
5 that the physical evidence doesn't match up with 
6 what you are telling us. That's just an example, 
7 okay. 
8 The entire layout of the scene is entirely 
9 different than what you described, okay. And when 
10 you come in here today and substantially change you 
11 say you saw and what you claim you saw on 
12 August 13th, that leads me to believe that maybe you 
13 didn't see this. And if that's the case, you need 
14 to tell me, okay. 
15 We're not even saying this, 
16 first of all. When you are running down the stairs, 
17 you say a lot of people were out there, you said you 
18 were scared, that's --

2 You are telling me I didn't 
3 see what I saw. This is not the first time that it 
4 happened, they did it to me last time I was here and 
5 try to tell me. 
6 The reason the FBI 
7 challenged you when you gave the statement before 
8 was because they knew at that time that what you 
9 were saying didn't add up with the physical 
10 evidence, okay. 
11 You would agree that is right? 
12 If you all knew the physical 
13 evidence, why would there be a need for a witness if 
14 you have the evidence already. 
15 You have to have people that 
16 actually saw it, that's what we are trying to say, 
17 okay. We're the prosecutors on this case, 
18 okay. And we have to evaluate the case and 
19 determine whether or not there are going to be 
20 charges and whether or not we would take it to 
21 trial. 
22 And so we would have to meet with the 
23 witnesses and talk to them, particularly the ones 
24 who were concerned that what their saying doesn't 
25 match up with the physical evidence. We have to

20 That happened more recently, 
21 right.

2 There were other people, other Ferguson 
3 police sitting on their cars looking at it. And 
4 then to tell me I'm lying. 
5 There is a lot that went on 
6 in the aftermath of the shooting. A lot of people 
7 were scared because they heard gunshots. A lot of 
8 people were talking, so the problem is that 
9 sometimes people, you know, thought they saw 
10 something, really it was because other people were 
11 talking so much. 
12 So our job is to figure out what each

1 since we was just best friends, he was just with me 
2 every day staying over there. If he needed 
3 something, I helped him out. I basically look at 
4 him just like a little brother. 
5 Q And so prior to August 9th when he got 
6 killed, how long had he been staying with you at 
7 your sister's house?

Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Using the laser pointer, can you 
21 point to the building where your sister's place is? 
22 A I would say it would have to be around, I 
23 don't know, it looks different from the sky view, it 
24 looks kind of different. I would say it would have 
25 to be over, okay, it had to be over here.
