2 know, I could let him around my family, my daughter

11 introduce anybody that comes over to my girlfriend 
12 and let them know we live here as a family, not as 
13 she's visiting, you know, she is with me. 
14 Q Okay. Had you ever been to his 
15 grandmother's house? 
16 A One time, but I never met anyone in his 
17 family. At that time I think his grandmother was 
18 real strict on who she let inside her home. So at 
19 that time I didn't know them that well, so he was 
20 telling me that you should come around more, my 
21 granny, she will like you, you will be able to come 
22 in. 
23 And at that time I really wasn't, you

Yes, ma'am. 
This is the day of the shooting. Tell us 
10 how your day began, August the 9th? 
11 A August the 9th, it began like any other 
12 day. I start my morning, I wake up, I take a 
13 shower, and I ask my girl does she like breakfast, 
14 what would she like for breakfast. I head out to go 
15 get it. Upon getting breakfast I get me some 
16 Cigarillos. I smoke marijuana in my mornings when I 
17 start my day off, so I was going headed to the 
18 store. 
19 Q Now wait a minute, just stop here to now 
20 and then to make sure we are all clear. So that is

5 Q Okay. And what, did you go over to where 
6 he was or did he come to you? 
7 A Yeah, just coincidently the guy who I was 
8 going to is like a path is passing up the building 
9 where he is living in now. So I was going to pass 
10 the building whether he was outside or not, just 
11 coincidentally he was outside and he was alone at

1 enough to me if I saw him I would stop and speak to 
2 him. 
3 So I stopped and spoke to him. He 
4 asked me where I was headed to. I told him, I was 
5 going to get some rillos and get something to eat 
6 for me and my girl, I'm headed back to the house. 
7 He was like okay, well, I'll match you. I guess he 
8 had his own weed, so he said he would match me one. 
9 Matching is, if you don't know, is just someone I 
10 will roll the weed, he will roll the blunt, we both 
11 exchange blunts. 
12 Q In matching does that mean that one person 
13 has the weed and one person has the rillos? 
14 A One person has their weed and rillos, the 
15 other person has his weed and rillos and they smoke 
16 together, it is just smoking together basically. 
17 Q So he said he would match you? 
18 A Correct. 
19 Q And then what happened? 
20 A He stopped and talked to some construction 
21 workers. There was two construction workers that 
22 was doing work on the bottom floor at the time of 
23 his building. They was doing work on my building 
24 also, but they was doing work at his building and he 
25 had stopped and said something to them. I really

1 didn't hear, but I notice that the construction

8 saying? 
9 A No, I couldn't hear what they were saying. 
10 I wasn't really focusing on their conversation

But that changed? 
Yes, it changed. 
Tell us how? 
It changed. We started talking, our 
5 conversation was about sports, he was into clothes 
6 and fashion, our conversation was drifting from 
7 topic to topic, but really based on sports, design, 
8 girls or what our future plans was. 
9 He was just telling me he was about 
10 to go off to school or go to school. I was telling 
11 him about my past experience in school. I was in 
12 school before Lincoln University, when I graduated 
13 high school, I went straight to school. So I was 
14 telling him some challenges that he was going to 
15 face, even though he wasn't at a university, he was 
16 going to face some challenges. Basically our 
17 conversation was about future, future emphasis.

19 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
It kind of took my mind off of going to 
20 the person in the complex because he didn't know the 
21 guy that I was going to. Big Mike, he didn't know 
22 the guy I was going to get the rillos from. When I 
23 told him I was going to get Cigarillos, he was like, 
24 I need one too. Let's walk to the store.

1 deep that I forgot that there was a person there 
2 that I was going to, so we ended up just walking to 
3 the store. 
4 Q Any idea, I know timing is difficult, but 
5 if you started out at seven-ish in the morning, any 
6 idea how long, how much time went by before you got 
7 to the market? 
8 A Before we got to the market, I mean, it 
9 wasn't really an hour, it wasn't that long, but our 
10 conversation because he had to go, I asked him could 
11 he go check on my friend that I knew ask him 
12 if he wanted to walk to the store with us. He said, 
13 yeah, he went up to go check on him. When he came 
14 back down, he told me that he was really sleepy, he 
15 didn't feel like it, he wanted to sleep in that 
16 morning. 
17 So that's basically what 30 minutes, 
18 I'm not real pressed on time, but it could have been 
19 more than an hour before we started walking. 
20 Q So from the time you left Canfield Green 
21 and then you saw Mike, Big Mike talked to the 
22 construction worker, you all talked some more and 
23 then you walked to the market?

A 
Q 
No, we went straight to the market. 
Market, okay. So tell us about the 
4 market, what happened at the market? 
5 A At the market, now, prior to walking to 
6 the store, never came up that he didn't have any 
7 money. I had money, I had money in my pocket. It 
8 never came up he didn't have any money or what we 
9 were going to do in the store because we already 
10 knew we was going to purchase Cigarillos, in my mind 
11 that's what we were going to do. 
12 It didn't strike me, I never thought 
13 that he didn't have any money because like I said, 
14 when I did see him the times that I see him, he 
15 dressed nice and next generation clothing, so it is 
16 kind of pricier, so I figure that he had money.

Yes, he is talking to the male store 
Go ahead. 
As he is talking to the male store clerk, 
6 the male store clerk ask him what does he want. Big 
7 Mike says in a very not, you know, threatening voice 
8 he just said, and while he was saying what he 
9 wanted, he said I want these box of Cigarillos. 
10 While he was saying it, he was leaning forward to 
11 grab them. 
Q Okay. 12 
13 A He leaned forward, but it wasn't a snatch 
14 and grab motion like he did it really quickly. He 
15 did it like, like he did it before I should say. 
16 Once he reached over the counter the first time, the 
17 store clerk, he was standing right in front of him, 
18 he never did anything, he didn't say anything, the 
19 first time, he didn't smack his hand down or 
20 anything like that. 
21 That was the time that he pulled back 
22 and he handed the box, it was a box of mini 
23 Cigarillos, 69 cent Cigarillos. It was just a box 
24 of them. He turned around and handed those to me.

1 A Now, at this time I still didn't think 
2 that he was not going to pay for them because I have 
3 saw people purchase a lot of Cigarillos at one time, 
4 a large amount. It is not that much 30 or $40, you 
5 can buy you a box. 
6 It wasn't until he went back the 
7 second time and grabbed a handful of the single 
8 Cigarillos. Now first he grabbed the box and the 
9 store clerk did nothing, this time he was going back 
10 to grab the single Cigarillos. As he was coming 
11 back, the store clerk did a late response and he

those up, he faced towards the door, that's

I didn't see, from where I was

23 know was, you know, did he do this all the time or

1 Now, while all of this is going on, 
2 Big Mike is making his way towards the door. The 
3 store clerk had came around, now he came around his 
4 register and he's making his way to the door. He's 
5 not like running or anything like that, more a pace 
6 walking and when he got to the front door, he didn't 
7 get there yet because a man, like I said, there was 
8 another male customer in there at the time. He had 
9 just purchased something. As he's leaving out, he's 
10 kind of holding the door open like he's watching, 
11 but he's trying to get away at the same time, like 
12 he didn't have nothing to do with it, but he is 
13 watching. I see him holding the door open. 
14 As he let the door close, Big Mike 
15 was almost at the door, so he was going to put his 
16 hand on the door to, you know, to push the door 
17 open. 
18 By that time the store clerk had got 
19 around and he was almost in front of the door, he 
20 didn't get there right directly in front of the door 
21 so much as put his hand on the door. 
22 Big Mike, Big Mike thrushed the door 
23 open to where the store clerk, it slipped out of his 
24 hand, so the door flew open. And at that time I 
25 was, I knew, I saw what was going on, but I didn't

1 know it was going to happen that way. So I was 
2 trying to pull myself as far away from the initial 
3 contact with the store clerk as possible because I 
4 didn't know what was going on. 
5 So at that time when he slung the 
6 door open, I was making my way, I was trying to get 
7 around Big Mike and the store clerk to exit the 
8 store because I didn't want any part of it, I knew 
9 there was cameras in the store. 
10 When Big Mike tried to go out and 
11 thrush the door open and came out of the store 
12 clerk's hand. The store clerk then tried to grab 
13 Big Mike and Big Mike kind of reverses the grab and 
14 grab, like it was a very fast motion, but the store 
15 clerk never came off of neither one of his feet. He 
16 never fell on the floor or got punched or anything 
17 like that, it was a very fast motion, just a shove. 
18 Q So when this grabbing is occurring, is Big

1 time I heard the store clerk saying something, we 
2 were walking out of the store and I heard the store 
3 clerk say, I'm going to call the police. 
4 Q And did Big Mike say anything in response 
5 to that? 
6 A Just kept walking. 
7 Q Okay. What did you guys do then, did you 
8 go and get something to eat? 
9 A At that time eating and all of those other 
10 things that I had on my mind were left field. I had 
11 just witnessed something occur that I feel like if 
12 not, you know, I was there. So I walked in with 
13 him, I felt like I was an accomplice. 
14 I was trying to figure it out in my 
15 head at the time we were leaving out of the store 
16 like, all right, I didn't know this was going to 
17 happen. I didn't touch anything, but I did see what 
18 just happened and I know there was a crime. 
19 Q Did you all talk about it, did you and Big 
20 Mike talk about it?

1 didn't strike me as a person who would do anything 
2 like that. He never talked about any crimes or 
3 anything like that. And prior to that day, it 
4 shocked me a lot, it shocked me a lot. So I was 
5 asking him, I was like, you know hey, I don't do 
6 stuff like that. What's going on. 
7 And so much is giving me an answer as 
8 to why he did it was he was basically laughing it 
9 off, be cool, be calm, stuff like that laughing it 
10 off but in my head I'm like, I can't be calm, I 
11 can't be cool because I know what just happened and 
12 we were on camera.

A 
15 camera. 
16 Q 
Did you talk to him about being on camera? 
I never said that, but I knew we were on 
Did he appear as if he had, was 
17 intoxicated or impaired in any way at that time? 
18 A No, like I said, the conversation leading 
19 up to the store was a general conversation I would 
20 have with anybody any other day. There was nothing 
21 strange about the conversation. He didn't say any 
22 words that made me feel like you need to sit down or 
23 anything like that. Up until that point I thought 
24 he was mindful of everything that was going on at 
25 the time.

1 Q So when you first encountered him or first 
2 made contact with him that morning, you said you all 
3 had never smoked together between the time you 
4 caught up with him to the time you went to the 
5 store? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Did he seem like he had some marijuana or 
8 something before you saw him that morning? 
9 Basically what you know of him? 
10 A Yeah, based on what I saw of him that 
11 morning before we walked to the store, he didn't 
12 look like he smoked anything that morning or 
13 anything like that at that time. 
14 Q Okay. So you guys are walking towards 
15 West Florissant?

We are waking down West Florissant. 
On West Florissant? 
Now we are walking down West Florissant, 
19 from Ferguson Market to Canfield is actually like, 
20 walking is like a four minute, five minute walk, 
21 especially when you are having a conversation 
22 talking, could be longer, could be shorter, but in 
23 that timeframe of walking to Canfield, I saw a 
24 police cruiser coming down, coming down West 
25 Florissant. It was a Ferguson cruiser, it was a

1 truck. 
2 At that time in my head I was like, 
3 wow, he called the police. They came really 
4 quickly, I knew that they would probably come 
5 quickly. I was just, wow, we're really going to get 
6 locked up, this is going to happen. 
7 But when the police officer, you 
8 know, they passed us, the first car never stopped at 
9 the Ferguson Market. The first car stopped at 
10 McDonald's right next to the Ferguson Market and 
11 they kind of just sit on the lot. And that kind of 
12 struck me as odd. I was like, wow, maybe he didn't 
13 call the police at that time. Maybe he didn't call 
14 the police or they didn't get the dispatch call or 
15 anything like that because they drove past us and at 
16 no point in time, the shorts that I had on, I had on 
17 pajama shorts, I didn't have pockets on them. 
18 I was not able to grab Cigarillos out 
19 of Big Mike's hand to put in my pocket, he had 
20 pockets. He did not put the Cigarillos in his 
21 pocket. The Cigarillos now he has them in both 
22 hands, now he is spreading them evenly apart and we 
23 are walking down plain sight West Florissant to 
24 Canfield. 
25 Q You are not like running or hiding?

1 A Not running or not hiding, we are in plain 
2 sight walking down the sidewalk while we are on West 
3 Florissant and I see the police cruiser. 
4 Q You walk to West Florissant and then what 
5 is the street that takes you into Canfield 
6 Apartments? 
7 A Canfield Drive. 
8 Q Canfield Drive. So you walk up Canfield 
9 Drive? 
10 A Well, once we get to Canfield, I see 
11 another police cruiser pass us by. Now this one, I 
12 believe, in my mind I believe he was going to the 
13 store to check the car if the store clerk made the 
14 call. At that time I wasn't aware, but I heard him 
15 say as I was walking out the store that he was going 
16 to call the police. 
17 And seeing two police squad cars 
18 before we got to Canfield, it made me believe that 
19 he did call the police and if so, why didn't they 
20 pull up on us at that time. 
21 But we got to Canfield and now we're 
22 walking down Canfield, like I said, we wasn't 
23 running, we wasn't ducking behind bushes or anything 
24 like that. 
25 Q There is not a lot of cars out on Canfield

2 A At that time there was not a lot of 
3 traffic, maybe two or three cars passed, which is, 
4 you know, not that much traffic up and down Canfield 
5 to what is backed up two or three cars will pass you 
6 going both ways. 
7 Q This is a Saturday? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q And according to the information, the 
10 records, it is somewhere around 11-ish or so, right 
11 around noon time that you guys were at that store? 
12 
13 
A According to the information, like I said. 
Q Would that sound reasonable to you if you 
14 heard that? 
15 A It sounds about right, about 11:30 or 
16 12-ish maybe. 
17 Q Okay, okay. So now you are walking, I 
18 guess, east on Canfield? 
19 A Canfield. 
20 Q Drive? 
21 A Yes, ma'am. 
22 Q All right. And tell us what happens?

1 beginning of Canfield. 
2 The conversation we was having at 
3 this point, we was talking the same, the 
4 conversation never changed about what we were 
5 talking about future goals and stuff like that, what 
6 we were planning on doing. 
7 And basically he was asking me 
8 questions on how did I transform to coming from 
9 where I was and getting on track and now I have my 
10 own apartment and stuff like that, I was just 
11 telling him a few things that I went through in my 
12 life that made me change and stuff like that. 
13 I knew he wasn't someone like me, I 
14 knew he didn't grow up where I grew up from, where 
15 there was a bunch of violent gangs and violent stuff 
16 occurring all the time. I knew that much about 
17 because I read from his demeanor he didn't come up 
18 that way. I'm telling him about my life story and 
19 how I come up from a bunch of tragedies. I went to 
20 school, I was still able to do things that I need to 
21 do in life. 
22 At that time he asked, at that time 
23 there was no cars, no traffic, no one was coming up 
24 or down Canfield Drive. We got in the middle of the 
25 street, got into the middle of the street. We're

1 walking in the middle, I'm in front of Big Mike and 
2 he's right behind me. He's real big so I know 
3 people can see him right above me. 
4 So we are walking on the street. At 
5 that time we are walking like 30 seconds, I'm not 
6 really on the time preferences, about 30 seconds and 
7 traffic started going, but no one blew their horns, 
8 no one made irregular turns to get around us like we 
9 were in the way and no one yelled out their windows, 
10 you guys are in the way, get out of the street, 
11 anything like that. Two or three cars had passed 
12 us. 
13 Q Let me ask you a question. Where were you 
14 guys headed at this point? 
15 A At this point we was headed back to my 
16 house or his house because where we were staying, 
17 like I said, we were staying directly apart from 
18 each other, but on opposite side of the streets. I 
19 lived on this side, my building was on this side and 
20 the building he was staying in at that time was on 
21 the other side of the street. 
22 Q So you hadn't decided whose place you were 
23 going to go to yet?

5 A As we're walking down the street, now I 
6 see the police cruiser approaching us, coming up 
7 west going back towards West Florissant. The police 
8 cruiser is approaching us, right before the police 
9 cruiser approached us, two cars had passed us 
10 already. Nobody said anything like we are in the 
11 street or nothing like that. 
12 When he got right directly on the 
13 side of us, the police officer Darren Wilson, when 
14 he got on the side of us he rolled his window down 
15 and he said, get on the sidewalk, but it wasn't in a
