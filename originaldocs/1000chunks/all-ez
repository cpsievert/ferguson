1 little bit of a break so we could print-out some 
2 transcripts because the grand jurors have asked to 
3 listen to the recorded statement of 
4 that was made to the FBI on September 30th. So we 
5 have that disc queued, it is about 22 minutes. We 
6 were going to try to play that before lunch, we 
7 didn't get to it because we were busy making the 
8 copies. You all still want to start that or do you 
9 want lunch. It is not out there right now. So go 
10 ahead and start this? 
11 The only other thing, and Sheila and I had 
12 a discussion about this before now is, she and I are 
13 going to kind of wing how we are doing this, after 
14 testified and she had come here with 
15 who she said was her godson and were 
16 in the waiting room here and testified after 
17 she did. 
18 So when we walked out and we were 
19 kind of saying goodbye to them and they were getting 
20 ready to walk out , I made the comment 
21 about how it is too bad there weren't surveillance 
22 cameras in the complex. 
23 And then said that she had video 
24 the entire thing on her phone and I said, what 
25 portion, what part did you video the whole thing I

1 said the shooting, you have the shooting taped on 
2 your phone. And she said yes, but I dropped the 
3 phone in the toilet. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Then I asked her, you know, 
5 where is the phone, thinking we might be able to 
6 recover it with forensic examination. She said it 
7 is in the junk yard. She got so mad she threw it 
8 away. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: This is information that 
10 I've never known about. 
11 
12 
MS. WHIRLEY: Neither have I. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And Sheila has never known 
13 about this, and from my observation of her godson 
14 , he was, this was news to him as well 
15 because he asked her where is the phone and, you 
16 know, he seemed to indicate that he had not heard 
17 that information before. 
18 So I thought it was important that you 
19 know that. 
20 
21 
MS. WHIRLEY: I agree. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila and I kind of 
22 unwittingly became witness to that statement. I 
23 don't think it is appropriate that we testify as 
24 witnesses, but what we discussed is that knowing 
25 that there was a statement made like that.

1 If you desire we can bring 
2 back in and question her under oath about whether, 
3 about that and you can ask her whatever questions 
4 you want, but I wanted you to have that information 
5 so that you could make a decision amongst yourselves

9 your lunch break and for now we will go ahead and

13 just sitting on her counter? 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: My recollection and this is 
15 what you all are going to have to discuss amongst 
16 yourselves what she testified to, I believe I asked 
17 her if she was wearing the camcorder when the 
18 shooting occurred, and she said no. I think she 
19 said it was in her house, she said that during the 
20 first interview she was in her pajamas when they 
21 came. 
22 She said that.

3 had it on when she was being interviewed by the 
4 officers, I recall something about that, you all are 
5 going to have to talk amongst yourselves about that. 
6 So no more questions?

10 that will be my interpretation and I don't want to 
11 have to do that. I will tell you that I think that
