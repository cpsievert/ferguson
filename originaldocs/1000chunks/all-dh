7 Q Who was the person standing by the car? 
8 A I don't know who the person, I didn't know 
9 who the person was, I just knew it was an

11 Q What did you see while the male was 
12 standing at the car? 
13 A He looked like pretty much had his hands 
14 directly pretty much in front of him standing at the

10 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Why not? 
Because I figure that he either was

12 him. 
13 Q Okay. So you didn't see anything that 
14 looked aggressive like fighting or tussling or 
15 anything like that? 
16 A Well because of the gunshots I thought 
17 that he was either shooting at the cop or something 
18 was going on or something might have been going on 
19 around in the area. So I just, when I first seen 
20 the police car and after hearing the shots I was

16 we heard the shots. I heard the shots when we were 
17 like about right, when we was coming around the bend 
18 around that corner. I didn't hear anything when I 
19 actually got a visual of what was going, you know, 
20 people standing there.

2 firing a weapon at that time, you say his gun is 
3 out, the police officer, is he firing at the

5 A No, he couldn't, if he was running with it 
6 down by his side down. 
7 Q Well, at any time did he change that 
8 position and start firing? 
9 A He didn't start, I didn't see him fire, I 
10 didn't even hear the gunshots until later. 
11 Q And what was happening when you heard the 
12 gunshots? 
13 A When I heard the gunshots and saw him 
14 firing his weapon, he was, Michael had stopped, he 
15 had stopped. He threw his hands up and then he put 
16 his hands down, Michael turned around and then he 
17 started running, he kind of shuffled back and forth 
18 a little bit like he was confused or something. And 
19 then he started running towards my car, he started 
20 running back towards us. 
21 The officer had ran, he was running 
22 after him. He had stopped, I heard him say get down 
23 about two or three times and he kind of veered off 
24 to the side a little bit, but he still was aiming 
25 his gun at the guy, at Michael. And he after, he

1 held his gun out at him, he was aiming the gun at 
2 him, he was telling him to get down. And like I 
3 said, Michael was shuffling back and forth like he 
4 was confused and then he started running and that's 
5 when I started hearing him shoot. 
6 Q While he was running toward the officer? 
7 A Kind of towards the officer. I couldn't 
8 be sure if he was running exactly towards the 
9 officer or just trying to run past him. 
10 Q But he was running in the officer's 
11 direction?

1 A Well, like I say, I couldn't be sure if he 
2 was trying to threaten him, like I said. 
3 Q I mean, a person, a reasonable person just 
4 looking at it, would you think in your mind? 
5 A I thought he was trying to charge him at 
6 first because the only thing I kept saying was is he 
7 crazy? Why don't he just stop instead of running 
8 because if somebody is pulling a gun on you, first 
9 thing I would think is to drop down on the ground 
10 and not try to look like I'm going to attack 'em, 
11 but that was my opinion. 
12 Q So it looked to you like he could be 
13 attacking him? 
14 A He looked like, he looked like he could 
15 have been attacking him or the officer could have 
16 felt like he was attacking him. 
17 Q I want you to tell me what your impression 
18 was as you looked at it? 
19 A I was looking at it, I could not be sure. 
20 Like I said the officer, he was like off to the side 
21 a little bit and Michael was probably, he was like 
22 standing here shuffling back and forth, and he took, 
23 he just started running. I don't know if he was 
24 trying to come towards the officer or if he was just 
25 trying to run past him.

9 this no more. He just threw his hands up and he

25 A I don't know.

You don't have an opinion about that? 
I don't have an opinion about that because 
3 I couldn't tell whether or not the guy was charging. 
4 I wasn't as close to him as the officer, I wasn't as 
5 close to the scene as the officer and Mike was so, I 
6 don't know what he could have been thinking. I 
7 don't know if he was thinking that he was trying to 
8 charge him or not. 
9 Q And when you saw him shoot him, the last 
10 shots to be fired when you saw the blood spray, how 
11 far did it seem that the officer and Mike Brown were 
12 apart from each other?

About as far as me and you are. 
Oh, okay. This close? (indicating) 
Uh-huh. 
And we're like less tan 10 feet apart 
Yeah, because he was pretty much staying 
19 back away from him. Mike was pretty much bigger, he 
20 was a little bit bigger than the cop was. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, all right. Thank you. 
22 That's all I have. Kathi? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Just a couple. Ma'am, did

25 ever hear or did anybody ever talk to you about the

1 autopsy report? 
2 A I think I heard about it, but I'm not 
3 really sure what it was about because I didn't try, 
4 I probably felt like I was going to be asked 
5 questions about it eventually, but since I didn't 
6 really, that was like pretty much nothing that I 
7 really witnessed, so I didn't really pay attention 
8 to it. 
9 Q So to this day, do you know where Michael 
10 Brown was shot on his body? 
11 A I heard that it was in his arm and in his 
12 head.

Q Okay. From the time that Michael Brown 
turned around and until the time he eventually 
collapsed in the street. 
A Uh-huh. 
Q Can you give me an idea, I know how close 
they ultimately got, but how far did he travel? 
A I couldn't really tell you because it 
25 looked like from where I was standing, where I was

1 sitting, I'm in the car, I'm trying to think. I'm 
2 not even exactly sure. I think that where his body 
3 
4 
5 
landed was like right about here. (indicating) 
Q Okay. 
A This is so hard to tell, especially not 
6 being there. 
7 Q Do you know about where he was when he 
8 turned around? 
9 A It was almost to like the end, I'm not 
10 sure if it was the end of this street or what, I 
11 can't remember. 
12 Q Okay. When you say this street, I didn't 
13 see the pointer? 
14 A He hadn't made it around. He hadn't made 
15 it around this corner, I know that it had to be 
16 
17 
18 
19 
within this same stretch right here. (indicating) 
Q Okay. 
A Because I could see him clearly. 
Q If you are saying his body was here, 
20 that's where he collapsed, so he was someplace west 
21 of that and then he ran east? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
And you don't have any good idea of like 
24 if I keep walking back if you're going to say stop 
25 if you want to say how far he ran?

Okay. Farther than I can walk back?

Q Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have anything else. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anything else? 
12 You said he had his hands 
13 up for a brief moment? 
14 A He had his hands up when he stopped, when 
15 he was running away from the officer. I don't know 
16 if he got tired or what, but he threw his hands up. 
17 Were they like this or 
18

1 people in the back seat and I think what happened 
2 was, as a matter of fact I knew I didn't have them 
3 up because, urn, it wasn't that hot because it was 
4 before noon when we left. It was around noon when 
5 we got there and it wasn't that hot that time of
