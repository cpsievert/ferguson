12 two more times as he's falling forward and then 
13 after that he stops. 
14 MS. Okay. When you walk out onto 
15 the balcony, was the police officer already 
16 shooting? 
17 No, ma'am.

22 MS. Okay. So just to be clear, you 
23 didn't see, you only saw the police officer pull up 
24 when the boys were first walking in the street,

12 were taking us through what you saw that day, you 
13 said something about Mike Brown took a step towards 
14 him, couldn't tell what exactly if he was stumbling 
15 or if he was taking a step, can you describe that? 
16 Well, it looked like as if 
17 he was just falling, I mean. But he took his step, 
18 his right foot went forward and I just seen him just 
19 drop to his knees and fall to the ground.

14 neighbors? 
15 No, not that I know of. 
16 MR. You said initially that 
17 people were talking about what went on at the side 
18 of the police car. You said that when you saw it 
19 you didn't really see anything that happened there 
20 and you didn't know if he was inside the car or not, 
21 but other people were talking about that, remember 
22 that?

25 those people up there?

4 This was the same day.

3 No, ma'am. 
4 MR. Based on what you saw, do 
5 you have any idea what happened from the time the 
6 police first pulled up there until the time the 
7 policeman fired those last four or five shots, do 
8 you know what went on there at all based on what you 
9 saw or heard that day? 
10 From what I heard is that 
11 they had a scuffle inside the car.

And what was that? 
I felt that the police

1 officer did that very unjustly, he overkilled 
2 basically. After the first shot, I mean, he didn't 
3 really have to shoot the young man in the first 
4 place. They have other means of, you know, 
5 corralling the suspect, you know, taser, anything 
6 else. 
7 He shot him the first time, even if you 
8 did have to shoot him, he didn't have to keep going, 
9 he didn't have to kill him because he was unarmed. 
10 MR. From what you saw that day, 
11 could you tell why the police officer shot at Mike 
12 Brown? 
13 I'm not sure why. 
14 MR. Okay. 
15 MS. And you don't know what 
16 happened in the car, right? 
17 No, ma'am.

19 happened while you were inside, correct? 
20 
21 
22 
MS. 
MR. 
No, ma'am. 
Okay. 
That's one of the reasons 
23 I'm asking because on that video you referred to, 
24 you said he shot him like six times. And you said 
25 for no reason, do you recall that?

Yes, sir. 1 
2 MR. Is it fair to say you didn't 
3 see what happened before those last four or five 
4 shots; is that right? 
5 
6 MR. 
Yes, sir. 
So do you know what the 
7 reason was the police officer shot him, if any? 
8 No, sir. 
MR. Okay. That's fair enough. 
MS. I think when you originally 
9 
10 
11 spoke to the FBI in you heard like two shots 
12 when you were inside, did you hear two or one or not 
13 sure? 
14 I'm not sure. I heard one 
15 for sure, I know that for sure. 
16 MS. And just so you know what I'm 
17 looking at, when you are interviewed by the FBI 
18 though and what you said, that's all I'm looking at. 
19 So it is a summary of what you told them. 
20 MR. After that one shot that 
21 you're sure you heard while you were inside, you 
22 didn't hear any other shots after that until the 
23 four or five that you actually saw? 
24 I mean, not that I 
25 remember.

But other than that --
I'm not suggesting that

5 that basically when you are in the apartment getting 
6 your cell phone, you hear at least one shot inside? 
7 Yes, sir. 
MR. You mentioned two before, as 8 
9 said at the FBI you mentioned two. You 
10 remember one for sure, maybe two, and then is it 
11 fair you don't recall hearing or seeing any other

2 actual video that you gave to the FBI that you wish 
3 you would have recorded it. So you ran and got your

17 didn't make anything better than what it was, 
18 especially when they brought the dogs out. That was 
19 very unnecessary. 
20 MS. How were the people in the 
21 community acting? 
22 They were all riled up for 
23 the incident. They all just doing crazy things,

25 were like, I wouldn't say intimidating the officers,

1 are talking and deliberating somebody can be looking 
2 through this as kind of to read for the rest of 
3 them. 
4 And I will tell you that at the end of the 
5 transcript there is an index and it will tell you 
6 what page and line a certain word appears on. So if 
7 you know what you are looking for, you could 
8 probably go back and search for it by referring to 
9 the index. 
10 For example the word easy, you recall he 
11 said something was easy, you know, and you're not 
12 sure about that. You might look back and find the 
13 word easy and you find that it appears on page 265 
14 and line seven. And that would be the way for you 
15 to kind of reference if you are looking for 
16 something in particular. 
17 So I will give this to you now. You can 
18 look at it during the lunch hour and if you guys 
19 decide each one want your own copy, I can make

21 you are right there.

22 A Yes. We do cases for the city and the 
23 county. We do a lot of the driving under the 
24 influence cases too. Our caseload goes from New 
25 Orleans, to Wisconsin, to California and all over

just for clarification sake, you are not a 
physician, correct? 
A No, ma'am, I'm not a physician. 
Q Okay. And so you didn't go to med school? 
A That is correct. My area is toxicology, 
23 affects of drugs.

1 County, back in August of 2014, did you receive some 
2 samples from a deceased person named Michael Brown? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And those, what were the samples that you 
5 received? 
6 A Oh, blood, urine and I think vitreous, or 
7 eye fluid. 
8 Q So samples that were obtained by someone 
9 else were preserved and then delivered to your 
10 laboratory; is that correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, the samples were taken at autopsy. 
And is your laboratory in the same 
13 building where the medical examiner performs 
14 autopsies? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So this is not like the sample had to be 
17 shipped anywhere? 
18 A No. They take the samples in the back and 
19 they walk them over and we sign for them.

Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going to hand you a 
1 
2 
3 copy of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 66. Is that the 
4 report that you made or a copy of the report that 
5 you did after testing samples that you received from 
6 the deceased, Michael Brown? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q All right. And I've made a copy of these 
9 as well for the grand jurors. And actually, I'm 
10 going to give one to the court reporter so he can 
11 have, some of the words are difficult for me to 
12 pronounce and spell. 
13 So, , first off, let me ask 
14 you, when the human body ingest a chemical or a 
15 substance, does the body process that over time? 
16 A Oh, absolutely. 
17 Q Okay. So if someone ingest a chemical or 
18 substance and then that person dies, does the body 
19 continue to process that chemical after death? 
20 A Well, when you are referring to 
21 processing, that is an energy requiring step, like 
22 the liver metabolism. When a person expires, the 
23 energy stops so there is no more metabolism. 
24 However, there are further reactions that go on just 
25 because there is certain enzymes, decomposition, PH,

1 things of that nature that can alter the drug 
2 concentration. 
3 Q Okay. So let me ask you from the time 
4 that the sample is retrieved from the deceased and 
5 then if it is properly preserved or maintained, is 
6 that sample going to degrade over time so that 
7 whatever chemicals may be found within that sample 
8 might change over time? 
9 A There can be some degradation, but as soon 
10 as the sample is drawn, it is refrigerated and then 
11 we start performing the test on it right away. So 
12 anything along those lines is minimal. 
13 Q Do you recall when it was that you 
14 obtained these samples or got them out again, your 
15 process or testing them? 
16 A Yeah, we received them August 11th of 
17 2014. 
18 Q And so if Michael Brown passed on 
19 August 9th and the autopsy was conducted on 
20 August lOth, Sunday, and then you received those 
21 samples on that Monday? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when you receive the samples, did it 
24 appear to you that they had been properly packaged 
25 and that they had been refrigerated properly?

A Yes, ma'am. 1 
2 Q Okay. So now you mentioned that you had 
3 received urine and blood and you said vitreous 
4 fluid, what is vitreous fluid? 
A Vitreous fluid is the fluid in your eye 5 
6 that keeps it round, okay. It is the fluid in the 
7 eyeball. 
8 Q And what is it, why would it be important 
9 to have a sample of the fluid in the deceased 
10 eyeball? 
11 A Well, see there is several things that can 
12 go on with your chest cavity, even motor vehicle 
13 accidents, trauma to the chest, you can get 
14 contamination of everything in here, okay. 
15 The eyeball, because it is so 
16 protected in the skull, if something happens to it, 
17 any trauma you don't have it because it ruptures. 
18 So other than that, you get a very good sample, 
19 relatively clean and pure sample and it represents 
20 the brain concentration, okay. So it is very close 
21 to whatever is in the brain to give you a handle on 
22 that. 
23 Q Now, in this particular case, did you test 
24 the vitreous fluid from Michael Brown? 
25 A

Page 46 
Q And why didn't you do that? 1 
2 A Well, in our case there was no reason to 
3 because of the nature of the drugs that we found, 
4 they don't get to the vitreous. It just takes too 
5 long and they are not present. 
6 The vitreous is very slow for 
7 equilibration. That is the concentration goes up in 
8 the blood and then it declines and the vitreous lags 
9 on some drugs. On these drugs the vitreous stays 
10 very low, the drugs do not penetrate into the 
11 vitreous. 
12 Q So you tested blood and urine that you had 
13 received from Michael Brown, correct? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And we'll talk about the actual process of 
16 testing those, but did you first do a test on the 
17 blood for alcohol? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And you don't need to go into that 
20 necessarily because the tests of the blood for 
21 alcohol, which are ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and 
22 methanol were all negative, correct? 
23 A Well, we list those, but we test for 
24 others, like toluylenes, Xylene, and so forth. 
25 Q And so you had, is it true then that all

1 of the tests for alcohol were negative on -- in your 
2 test of the blood of Michael Brown? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Now, let me ask you this. If there was a 
5 subsequent test done on a sample of blood that was 
6 done by another professional, and if they had 
7 actually had a different finding that perhaps had a 
8 level of .023, how would you describe, do you have 
9 an explanation as to why that could be positive, 
10 another test done later? 
11 A Sure. The reason for that is 
12 decomposition. As I said, the longer a sample sits 
13 and then transport and everything else that goes 
14 along with it, you can get a little bit of alcohol 
15 generated. And .02 is nothing, so it would just be 
16 decomposition. 
17 Q So that could possibly be explained by the 
18 decomposition that occurred in the sample? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And, all right. So let's talk about the 
21 drug screening for the blood that you ran. And if 
22 everybody can refer to your report on Grand Jury 
23 Exhibit 66, which I don't think I marked actually on 
24 your report, there are a number of drugs that you 
25 tested for; is that correct?

A Yes. 1 
2 Q And every one of those tests was negative 
3 except for the test for cannabinoids, correct? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q And so just to be clear, when you say you 
6 have a negative test, is there like a threshold or a 
7 level that could be present but not detected? 
A Yes. 8 
9 Q And so when you run tests for various 
10 chemicals, if the level that is detected in the 
11 sample that falls below a threshold, then that is 
12 considered a negative, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q All right. And so you receive negative 
15 reading on amphetamines, antidepressants, 
16 barbiturates, and all the other drugs that you
