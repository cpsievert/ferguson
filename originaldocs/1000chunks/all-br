9 reporters, they was coming to my house, calling my 
10 phone, they coming to my momma's house. I don't 
11 know how they got my momma's address. 
12 They called my next door neighbor, I don't 
13 know how they get her number. They was just like, 
14 when I get home, it has been like a good two weeks 
15 after his death, like they like, when I get home, I 
16 like to straighten out my apartment. I like to 
17 straighten up to make sure everything is right. 
18 I've got kids, you know, I like to 
19 straighten up and relax. That's the first thing I 
20 like to do when I get home there may be three or 
21 four waiting on me, you know, trying to get a piece

1 is just when it hit me, that same night after doing 
2 that show, I came back home and my fiancee came home 
3 too, and we kind of had some words exchanged and she 
4 didn't want to give me a kiss or whatever, but 
5 normally when she don't do that, I go up and mess 
6 with her, but I didn't bother her at all about that. 
7 I just went into the kitchen and started 
8 walking around in the kitchen and I started to fix 
9 me a sandwich. As I was fixing a sandwich, I've got 
10 the two (inaudible) out, but I'm just pacing back 
11 and forth in the kitchen. I started sweating and 
12 being real nervous. 
13 So when my fiancee walking around, you

15 and said look, you know, right now, you know, what 
16 you want right now is petty right now, I just want 
17 to tell you that right now. I'm feeling very, very 
18 sick right now, very, very sick. I'm shaking and 
19 I'm nervous right now and I'm scared, you know.

21 kind of different. Like I said, my stomach started 
22 hurting then one morning, on Monday morning, on 
23 Mondays I have to be at work about 6:00 in the 
24 morning to go to the office, but I woke up like five 
25 something with some real chest pains.

12 I do think of the Klu Klux Klan, I do 
13 think of them. You know what, a friend told me 
14 yesterday, I don't know if it is true or not, I 
15 doubt if it's true. He said, uh, that something 
16 happened to Mike Brown's family at their house, like
