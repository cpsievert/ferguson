11 don't see a good abrasion ring, don't see a good 
12 contusion, don't see any bruising, don't see 
13 anything that I typically see in a situation of an 
14 entrance wound, so I know that's an exit wound. 
15 This is going to be in relationship 
16 to another wound that I will get to eventually. 
17 So this is 94. And the only thing 
18 different about this is the introduction of the 
19 ruler.

Q 
A 
This is 95? 
This is 95. This is the right side of 
22 Mr. Michael Brown's face. I am wanting you to focus 
23 on this wound right here, which is a gunshot 
24 entrance wound. This stuff here, these are 
25 abrasions. I'll just describe them.

1 So up here on the right forehead, 
2 this kind of irregular area right here. This is an 
3 abrasion, as I said before, an abrasion is just 
4 where that superficial layer of the skin rubbed off 
5 and exposes that underlying soft tissue. That 
6 particular abrasion right there measures about 
7 7 centimeters at its greatest dimension, kind of the 
8 longest point. 
9 Then there is one over here on the 
10 lateral part of his face, it is kind of dried, 
11 meaning when I say dried, see how it is kind of 
12 discolored, this is more pink, this is dried. 
13 That's an abrasion right there on the right side of 
14 the face. 
15 And then let's see. And then over 
16 here, you will see it later, out there on the lip he 
17 has got some abrasions here on the inside of this 
18 lip. 
19 But back to the gunshot wound which 
20 is going to be the main thing I'm going to talk 
21 about next and that's going to be number two on your 
22 autopsy report. 
23 This is 96. Only thing different 
24 about this photo than the last one is just the 
25 introduction of the scale with the ruler.

1 This is 97. So this is this gunshot 
2 entrance wound of the central forehead. So it is 
3 located 7 centimeters above the right ear hole and 2 
4 centimeters to the right of the anterior midline of 
5 the head. So the imaginary midline of the head is 
6 here, it is 2 centimeters off to the side. So that 
7 just kind of locates the wound. 
8 The whole measures 15 millimeters by 
9 10 millimeters. The wound itself is somewhat oval, 
10 I can see better on the photo here, but right there, 
11 there is kind of an abrasion ring out here on the 
12 outside. 
13 What that is kind of helpful with is, 
14 it is kind of letting me know that it is going 
15 downward because when this, when this bullet came 
16 in, the abrasion ring is more irregular to this 
17 side, it is bigger on this side than it is there. 
18 So when it is rubbing in, I know that it is coming 
19 in a downward fashion. One, just because of the 
20 abrasion ring and two, because of where it 
21 ultimately went on his face. 
22 So it is coming here, think of the 
23 anatomical. It is here and when it is coming down 
24 passing there and it is going to come out of the 
25 face. So that you've got two reasons for how you

1 know it is down. The abrasion collar and also just 
2 the starting here and ending up there. It is coming 
3 from the top to here. 
4 Q And, Dr. did you determine that 
5 path not only, I mean, possibly via x-rays, but did 
6 you probe that wound as well? 
7 A Yes, I probe all of my wounds to make sure 
8 that the entrances and the exits do coordinate. 
9 Does your 
10 assumption in talking about how body parts move 
11 that, or like when his head was down, and the 
12 officer was standing above him. 
13 
14 
15 
A 
A 
That's a possible scenario. 
Thank you. 
So we got that. So now we dealt with the 
16 abrasion collar, we know there is an entrance wound. 
17 So now you want to look at your x-rays to see if you 
18 see any type of bullets associated with this. There 
19 are little tiny fragments, but no large intact 
20 bullets, I can't recover those. Those are not good 
21 for ballistics, you need kind of an intact chunk to 
22 be good for ballistics. 
23 All right. So in terms of soot or 
24 any type of stippling, there is nothing around it, 
25 only thing that is nearby are these abrasions.

1 So in terms of trajectory, how far 
2 away, I can't determine this, this is an another 
3 indeterminate wound that is going to be greater than 
4 3 feet away. 
5 In terms of the actual trajectory 
6 itself, it is downward, slightly backward and going 
7 to the right. It is going down, going back, meaning 
8 this is the front part of the head, it is coming 
9 back over here, so it is backward down and going to 
10 the right because this is the center, this is right 
11 side and it is going that way. 
12 All right. Now in terms of the 
13 actual tissue planes that it passes through, it is 
14 going from the skin, it's going through the soft 
15 tissue and the things that is interesting about this 
16 one is, so when it is passing through, there is 
17 like, there is defect here, call it a laceration, 
18 call it a defect. 
19 In my particular situation, I called 
20 it gunshot related defect because as this bullet 
21 passed through, there is enough meat and skin here 
22 on the front of Mr. Michael Brown's forehead that 
23 this bullet is tunneling underneath that skin. When 
24 it got right here where the eyebrow was resting over 
25 that ridge of bone that we all kind of have right

1 there, it disrupted that tissue, continued to travel 
2 underneath and then went by his eye here. There is 
3 another defect, it passed through the actual globe 
4 of the eye. 
5 Then you have a bone here, right 
6 underneath your eye, it went through that bone, 
7 passes through there, you have a bunch of soft 
8 tissue here in your jaw and cheek, it passes through 
9 there and then eventually comes out of the jaw right 
10 here on the side. So that's the particular path of 
11 this particular shot. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, does this 
13 projectile travel through any portion of the brain? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No, it does not. 
And now I know you said it went through 
16 some bone that was below the eye, does it fracture 
17 the bone at the entrance site? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No, it does not. 
So it goes into the skin and the soft 
20 tissue and then almost travels along the bone, along 
21 the, just underneath the skin?

15 MS. WHIRLEY: Shirley Whirley. Would the 
16 combination, you said you can't talk about the 
17 sequence of the shots which occurred first, but the 
18 combination of the shots that we've seen before the 
19 fatal shot, it still would not render this person 
20 disabled. 
21

A Correct. 
You talked about 
23 the abrasions, anything that you conclude from the 
24 abrasions, how they occurred?

1 that particular part of your body came in contact 
2 with another force. So to get an abrasion, I fell 
3 right now, I hit my head right there, I could scrape 
4 off skin. I fell down on the ground and collapsed 
5 on the ground that could cause those abrasions. 
6 From the way he's positioned where 
7 he's found after he's rendered disabled, his face is 
8 in contact with the ground and that's consistent 
9 with that position. 
10 There need to be forward 
11 motion on that face to scrape it like that.

You would need some sliding. 
Some sliding 
For it to rub off. You need a frictional 
15 force. You can't just plop straight down, plop 
16 straight down and cause more bleeding, you get more 
17 contusions from things just stopping and don't 
18 slide. When things slide with friction, that's when 
19 it gets rubbed off, and that's when you get your 
20 frictions. 
21 I don't 
22 recall, or not speaking about the abrasions, did you 
23 find any evidence of any type of burn to the skin or 
24 anything, any type of injury like that because we 
25 all know, I mean, this happened at 12:00, and the

1 young man laid there on the ground in one of the 
2 hottest days of the year. Any type of wounds such 
3 as that, any evidence of anything of that nature? 
4 A There's really no burning per se, but 
5 there is one wound on the cheek that had a dry 
6 appearance, that's about the only thing that, you 
7 know, contact could be a drying affect or something 
8 where the pavement is warmer, who knows, but that 
9 feature is there. There is no burning of anything. 
10 Okay, thank you. 
11 Are the 
12 abrasions severe enough that you think the victim 
13 would have been in motion at the time of the fatal 
14 shot or could have been standing at the time of the

16 simply falling from a standing position?

1 at the top of Mr. Michael Brown's head. This is the 
2 top portion of his scalp. So what is happening here 
3 when he originally came in, I documented the body 
4 how it is, I shaved the hair off of his head to 
5 expose the wound, so this is what I created when he 
6 came in. He didn't look like this was all black 
7 hair here, you couldn't even see the wound. The 
8 reason why I knew it was there is from my x-rays, as 
9 well from palpating the head, I could feel a wound 
10 and I saw blood coming from there, that's why I knew 
11 there was something there. 
12 Once I identify a wound like that on 
13 the head, it is standard protocol and procedure for 
14 me to remove the scalp, not the scalp, the hair in 
15 order to one, be able to assess the collar, the 
16 abrasion collar, to help with distance and to also 
17 look for any type of stippling or soot. 
18 Kind of, you know, in a classical 
19 sense, typically the hair can block these things 
20 from being deposited on the skin, but proper 
21 protocol to be able to wipe away that hair to see if 
22 you can see anything that may have penetrated the 
23 hair and got to the skin to be able to help with the 
24 range.

1 remove the hair to be able to assess wounds to help 
2 you with distance and to also be able to 
3 characterize the nature of the wound. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You know that brings up 
5 a question regarding the deposit of the soot or 
6 stippling. If the projectile enters through a piece 
7 of clothing, could that also affect whether or not 
soot or stippling is deposited on the skin? 
A That is correct. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
Q And in this case, the clothing was removed 
off of the body, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
13 Q And do you recall having a short sleeve 
14 shirt on, correct? 
15 A Correct. 
16 Q Now, did you examine the clothing yourself 
17 to determine if there were any holes in the 
18 clothing? 
19 A I do look at the clothing to look for 
20 defects and that's what I refer to them as.

Did you see any defects in the shirt?

1 are. I generalize and say there are defects present 
2 in the shirt. 
3 Q Okay, all right. Thank you. 
4 A All right. So this particular one I think 
5 is probably Number 1. We are going to be looking at 
6 Wound Number 1 on the autopsy report. This is the 
7 gunshot entrance wound to the vertex of the scalp. 
8 So positioning as I always do, it is 
9 20 centimeters above the level of the ear, we are 
10 also going up from here. And it's, and it's near 
11 the actual midline of the head. So if you look, it 
12 is pretty much in the center, kind of dead on. 
13 The hole measures 10 millimeters by 
14 8 millimeters. It's roughly round and it has pretty 
15 level edges. 
16 Now, when you look at the edges as I 
17 always do, you can kind of see this little bit of 
18 pink tissue around there, that's that abrasion 
19 collar that is going to let you know theoretically 
20 this is an entrance wound. 
21 Now I have to caveat with gunshot 
22 entrance wounds to the head. You should never just 
23 purely go by the classical thing that we talked 
24 about, abrasion rings and contusions. The problem 
25 with it is the head is a skull that's underneath and

1 that bone creates a different type of resistant path 
2 for the bullet to pass through. 
3 The best way to determine if there is 
4 an entrance or an exit wound of the skull is on my 
5 examination, when I reflect the scalp, which is a 
6 normal part of the procedure and remove the skull 
7 cap. When you look at the actual hole, and I think 
8 there will be some pictures eventually, we'll get to 
9 that. 
10 When you actually look at the hole, 
11 there is a concept called beveling. Beveling is 
12 where you will see an outpouching of the bone. So 
13 if the outpouching of the bone is to the inner table 
14 of the gunshot wound, that's an entrance wound. If 
15 the beveling or outpouching is on the outside of the 
16 outer table of the skull, that's called external 
17 beveling, that's an exit wound. 
18 So when I get to it, this particular 
19 wound had internal beveling, so that lets me know 
20 for sure that this is an entrance wound to the head. 
21 It is pretty much every time, I just want to make 
22 sure you understand that.

1 his head? 
2 A The shot fired has to be above the head. 
3 So in theory, if I'm sitting here and somebody's up 
4 there and shoots down, you have to be above, the 
5 shot has to be fired above his head in order for 
6 that to happen.

8 you say above, you're talking the anatomical 
9 diagram? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I'm just theorizing here, just theorizing. 
12 So if someone in this position, in other words, is 
13 bent over at the waist and the top of my head is 
14 facing the wall, that could account for a bullet 
15 that would enter the top of the head, correct? 
16 A That is correct. 
17 Q In this case you have no way of knowing 
18 where, what position his body was in when he 
19 sustained that gunshot wound? 
20 
21 
A No, I do not know specifically, correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: But it would be 
22 inconceivable for him to be standing at 6'4", 
23 straight up and have that shot to the top of his 
24 head from someone not as tall as him, taller than 
25 him?

3 A So as we always do, we want to see if 
4 there is any stippling or soot. That's not soot, 
5 that's just his hair. That wasn't scraped all the 
6 way off with a scapple. There is no soot, there is 
7 no stippling. So in terms of range, that is a wound 
8 that is greater than 3 feet away again. 
9 An x-ray, full body x-ray on this 
10 particular situation, there is a bullet associated 
11 with this wound that I ultimately recovered within 
12 the soft tissue on the right side of his face that's 
13 associated with this wound, there is a projectile. 
14 All right. There is internal 
15 beveling of this bone of the skull, which I was 
16 telling you about before, that lets me know that 
17 this is an entrance wound. 
18 The path or trajectory on this one 
19 based on the anatomical position is going downward, 
20 it is going from the top of the head towards the 
21 feet and it is going right. Meaning that when it 
22 passes through the head and goes through the brain, 
23 you got your outer part of your skull here, it is 
24 going that way and burying itself. You can see it 
25 is down and to the right. So that is how you know

2 In terms of the actual tissue that it 
3 is passing through, going through the scalp, the 
4 skin surface of the head, soft tissue, the parietal 
5 bone of your skull, that's the particular location 
6 of the skull cap specific for me, but just layman's 
7 term, just your skull. 
8 Once it went through the skull, it 
9 hit the brain and your brain is separated in 
10 hemispheres. So you have a parietal bone, you have 
11 a parietal lobe. So it went through the parietal 
12 lobe of the brain, then it went through the temporal 
13 lobe of the brain. This is all on the right side. 
14 Then it passed through the right 
15 temporal bone of the skull, which is out here and 
16 punched through there and buried itself right here 
17 in the skin, the soft tissue beneath the skin on the 
18 right side of his head. So that's the path of the 
19 bullet. 
20 So when it goes through there, it is 
21 going to create injuries to the brain. There are 
22 small little tears or contusions that are happening 
23 to the brain as this bullet is punching its way 
24 through the white matter of the brain. You have 
25 gray matter on the outside and white matter on the

2 The white matter is responsible for 
3 your, the nervous impulses that are going to go 
4 through your brain. So those tracks, there is 
5 little small contusions there, that's just from the 
6 pathway of the bullet going through the brain. 
7 There is also hemorrhage associated 
8 with the wound. You have multiple spaces in your 
9 brain. You have an epidural space, which is, you 
10 know, you have your skull, beneath your skull 
11 there's a space and then you have your dura. Your 
12 dura is kind of like, for lack better of a better 
13 word, the skin of the brain. In between that 
14 imaginary space is called the dural space, there's a 
15 space there. 
16 You can get the dural, then you start 
17 getting to another space and then you get to the 
18 brain. So beneath that dural space is the subdural 
19 space. 
20 There is blood there and there is 
21 actual blood on the surface of the brain, which is 
22 the subarachnoid space. There is two areas where 
23 there is blood, you have defects of where the bullet 
24 is entering and then kind of exiting out on the 
25 brain and staying in the soft tissue.

1 So those are the main injuries that 
2 you have associated with this wound that's passing 
3 through the skull and burying itself right there in 
4 the soft tissue. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Dr. if 
6 someone who sustained that type of injury to his 
7 brain, would that immediately incapacitate him?

No, they would not. 
Would they be conscious? 
No, they would not. 
And is this a fatal injury? 
Yes, it is. 
And is there any amount of medical 
17 intervention that would, could possibly save the 
18 life of someone sustaining that injury? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Highly unlikely. 
All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody have any 
22 questions about this injury? 
23 You said 
24 that you had to remove the hair from that area. Is 
25 it possible to get any kind of soot or anything, any

1 kind of sampling of that or was anything sent in to 
2 be examined or is it even possible to get any type 
3 of evidence out of that? 
4 A It is always possible, but nothing was 
5 sent off with regard to the hair.

7 shaved off the scalp was not collected and kept?

No. 
Or tested in any way? 
No, it was not. 
Okay. 
Any other questions about this wound? 
101. Same wound, but just the 
14 introduction of the ruler. 
15 Q And just so I'm clear on this, the bullet 
16 that we're talking about is Wound Number 1 in your 
17 report, entered the brain, traveled through the 
18 brain and then you said was in the temporal region 
19 just beneath the skin or the soft tissue? 
20 A It is a little bit, it is coming right 
21 through the bone of the skull, it is sitting in the 
22 soft tissue right there. 
23 Q In photographs, is there an injury to the 
24 side of his face where that bullet rest beneath the 
25 surface?

1 A It did not make an injury on the outside 
2 of the face that would correlate to the inner 
3 injury. 
4 Q Just for the sake of these, all of these 
5 injuries that you talked about, there was a 
6 projectile that was found in his brain, correct?

2 Q Okay. And then regarding any other 
3 samples that you took, you've already testified that 
4 you took a sample from that thumb area?

7 Like for a blood stain card for DNA? A

DNA? 
A Yes. 
13 
14 
15 Q And then there is a sample of blood put in 
16 a tube or something? 
17 A Yeah, there is two types of tubes. We 
18 have a red top tube, which is just basically a tube 
19 with no preservatives in it, just going to be pure 
20 blood and then we do a gray top tube has a 
21 preservative, like sodium chloride. It is important 
22 for dealing with testing for like cocaine, things of 
23 that nature. 
24 Cocaine is kind of volatile and kind

1 there to stop the activity of the enzymes in the 
2 blood. That is what the gray top tube is for. 
3 So we do a red top and gray top for 
4 toxicology, and the specific blood that I used was 
5 chest cavity fluid that was sitting from that 
6 gunshot wound. There is a lot of blood there. I 
7 used that for my toxicology because the other 
8 locations to try to get blood was very difficult. 
9 He had lost blood, it is difficult to get sometimes, 
10 so you get it where you can get it from. The 
11 biggest reservoir of blood was the chest cavity. 
12 Q And did you also take a sample of the 
13 vitreous fluid from his eye?

And that's preserved for toxicology?

And then you also said earlier you had

24 from him?

1 cutting done. All of these photographs are going to 
2 be available for you. 
3 If you want, we can have him go 
4 through them one by one. I prefer him to testify 
5 about what he saw when he opened up the body and so

7 going to be up to you guys, okay? 
8 And so also let's go through the rest 
9 of these injuries that are photographed and then 
10 when we get to the cutting part, I'll ask you guys 
11 if you want to start going through those 
12 photographs. If you want to look at them on your 
13 own at a later time. 
14 I 
15 have one question for you. I need to understand, 
16 all of the injuries with the exception of number 
17 one, accumulatively he could have still survived and 
18 been mobile? 
19 A He could have been mobile, I wouldn't 
20 necessarily say survive. Those chest wound 
21 injuries, those would have eventually become fatal 
22 if not addressed. 
23 He would have been 
24 mobile, but this one absolutely? 
25 A Absolutely.

1 Those 
2 thorax wounds if treated, he could survive that? 
3 A Unlikely, the chest wound. The problem 
4 with chest wounds, this is going to be the 
5 physiological problem with it. You need your lungs 
6 to breathe. When those bullets went into his lung, 
7 it punctured it, it squeezed it down, so now he is 
8 only working on one lung. At the same time what 
9 happens is there is vessels in there that he 
10 injured. 
11 So as that chest cavity fills up with 
12 blood, it is going to get to the point where it 
13 fills up with so much that it shifts all of those 
14 organs on the inside of your body to the other side. 
15 And the problem with organ shifting is you have a 
16 major organ in the middle of your chest, which is 
17 your heart. 
18 So think of it kind of like a garden 
19 hose. You put too much pressure on one end of it, 
20 it stops the flow of the water. So the stop of the 
21 flow of the water, in this situation is the blood. 
22 When that thing starts filling up and pushing over 
23 to the side, those vessels get squished, squished 
24 and eventually get squeezed off to where now the 
25 blood can no longer get returned to the heart to get

1 pump to other areas. And then that's the main 
2 problem is your head is not getting blood, now you 
3 are going to become unconscious. You are going to 
4 have two problems, you're not getting blood, your 
5 blood carries your oxygen. So you are not getting 
6 any oxygen to the brain, you are physically not 
7 getting blood to the brain, you are also losing 
8 blood out of your body, inside of your body. So you 
9 kind of got a lot of problems there.

11 immediately, the hemothorax could be reversed?

A 
Q 
If you had some medical intervention. 
That's what I mean. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Would you say, 
that medical attention would have to 
16 be immediate? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
I agree. 
Like if he were shot in the hospital, then 
19 possibly if there was a doctor at his elbow, 
20 possibly he could have medically then have survived 
21 those injuries? 
A Correct. 22 
23 Q Without immediate medical attention, he 
24 eventually would have died, alone of the internal 
25 thoracic injuries?
