5 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me back up here. Do 
6 you have expertise to talk about the CAD system? 
7 A I know the mechanics, the technology, you 
8 know, how they receive the timing, but as far as it 
9 is all software and every department has got a 
10 different type of CAD. So I couldn't tell you 
11 exactly what information goes in it or how the 
12 screen is. How most of them are set up for timing. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: That's what I want to know 
14 about. 
15 A So a lot of departments bought what they 
16 call Net Clocks. They are little boxes that are 
17 connected to a GPS antenna and they get their timing 
18 from the satellites, just like our car GPS works. 
19 There is also timing that is done and this box kind 
20 of distributes that timing mechanism, which can go 
21 to logging reporters, their CAD, some departments I 
22 set up their consoles have this timing. So that all 
23 the timing is the same throughout. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So when an officer 
25 calls in, let's say I'm on a traffic stop or I'm out

1 with a pedestrian, would that information be timed 
2 into the dispatch or to this CAD system? 
3 A I can't answer that. I don't know. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
5 A I have been listening to police calls 
6 since I was eight years old. Most of the time, the 
7 dispatcher, the officer will call in, I'm at a 
8 traffic stop blah, blah, blah. She will usually 
9 repeat, car 104 is at a traffic stop at 1520 hours, 
10 or something like that. And that's usually the time 
11 the officer will write down that time and that is 
12 what's recorded in the CAD so all the times are 
13 together. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: , you didn't set 
16 up the CAD system in Ferguson, correct? 
17 A I did not. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: And you don't know how they 
19 have it set up? 
20 
21 
A That's correct, I do not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So is it possible that the 
22 time for their CAD calls might differ from the time 
23 that dispatch calls? 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Definitely. 
MS. ALIZADEH: If they set them manually

1 as opposed to getting those times from the 
2 satellite, is it possible then that those times 
3 could be off? 
4 A Yes, definitely. I know I did not sell 
5 them a Net Clock or any type of timing mechanism. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: What about compare it also 
7 to, for example, county communications. Is it 
8 possible that Ferguson's CAD calls and their 
9 dispatch calls might not be timed, the CAD's might 
10 not be the same with the county communication clock? 
A Definitely. 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So a call that we all know 
13 for a fact that was made at 3:00 in the afternoon. 
14 The dispatch time might be 3:02, the CAD call might 
15 say 3:01 and yet the county communication, if it 
16 were received there, might say it was 3:00? 
17 A Yes, definitely. 
18 
19 
20 
MS. ALIZADEH: Be it is just one call? 
A Yes. 
I just 
21 want to make sure I understood you. The 
22 point-to-point channel, this is dispatch, and the 
23 portable is not transmitting and they can only hear 
24 what's going on? 
25 A

6 So if an officer had his 
7 portable on that channel while he is in the car, 
8 left the car, he thought he was calling in, nobody 
9 would hear him --
10 A That's correct. 
11 until he changed the 
12 channel? 
13 A Right. What he is going to hear is maybe 
14 a bong because that is a receive channel only. 
15 That would be the same, 
16 not that nobody would hear him, but dispatch would 
17 hear him if he was on a RIOT channel, he is on the 
18 mutual aid channel or any of the other channels, he 
19 would have to it put it on one, which is a dispatch 
20 channel for his dispatch to hear him? 
21 A No, if he's on point-to-point, I'm sorry, 
22 if he's on RIOT channel. 
23 Uh-huh. 
24 A And dispatch has RIOT channel turned on at 
25 the console at Ferguson, and he's close enough, yes,

3 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
4 (End of the testimony of .) 
5 It is 3:28 on November 3rd. This is Kathi 
6 Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, also all 12 
7 grand jurors are present and , the court 
8 reporter. And we just had a discussion off the 
9 record that we talked about that a witness that I 
10 had scheduled for this afternoon didn't show up, so 
11 we are kind of out of material for today. 
12 And so you all agree to go ahead and 
13 recess early today. There has been discussion now 
14 about additional things that you all want. It is my 
15 understanding that we're going to get a Ferguson 
16 police vehicle that is not the same vehicle, but the 
17 same make, model and year. So we have to set up 
18 when we are going to do that. 
19 There's been a request to get the press 
20 conferences from Chief then there's been a 
21 request to get, I will get you copies of the 
22 transcript of Officer Darren Wilson's grand jury 
23 testimony. 
24 You should have a transcript of his 
25 interview that he did with the county police on the

1 lOth, but I will get the transcript for you for 
2 tomorrow, give it to you tomorrow. 
3 And then I'm also going to contact Chief 
4 to see if he can appear to answer any 
5 questions that you may have that might arise out of 
6 your viewing of the press conferences. And is there 
7 anything else? Oh, yes, you talked about getting a 
8 field training officer. So I will talk to Ferguson 
9 about that. 
10 I think we discussed the fact that it's 
11 Darren Wilson's field training officer in Ferguson 
12 is currently and so probably we 
13 would want to find somebody else who could talk 
14 about the training that they do for their officers 
15 in general. 
16 Would obviously not be that he received, 
17 but in general. Is that all we can think of for 
18 now? 
19 Perhaps get somebody in 
20 the Normandy Police Department that trained him? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
MS. ALIZADEH: That was Jennings. 
Oh, sorry, Jennings.

1 some field training instruction before he came over 
2 to Ferguson and that way you avoid 
3 situation. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So we will recess early 
5 today and it is my understanding that tomorrow we're 
6 going, you are going to get here at 8:00, we start 
7 up about 8:30-ish, whenever you are all here. And 
8 then we're stopping at 4:00 tomorrow for the

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XIX 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning, it is 
Page 5 
3 Tuesday, November 4th, at 8:46 a.m. This is Kathi 
4 Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, all 12 grand 
5 jurors are present, as is , the court reporter. 
6 And we had a brief discussion before we went on the 
7 record this morning about some matters, about 
8 matters that the grand jury had inquired about, and 
9 I've answered them to the best of my ability. 
10 And, uh, now we discussed that yesterday 
11 we attempted to play a disc for the grand jury which 
12 is marked as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 63, and it is 
13 a disc that contains the statement of 
14 a witness who has testified last week. And we 
15 weren't able to play that for some reason, the disc 
16 doesn't play, can't open it. 
17 So I have another disc that we're going to 
18 play that is also a disc that I received from the 
19 FBI, which is Grand Jury Exhibit 56. 
20 (Deposition Exhibit Number 56 
21 marked for identification.) 
22 
23 
MS. ALIZADEH: And hopefully this will 
play. This is the statement of It 
24 is 29 minutes and 11 seconds long. We do not have a 
25 transcript because this was actually the statement

1 that he made last week. I'm not sure of the date, 
2 but it was done after he came from the State of 
3 to come up here and testify. It was recently 
4 done, we don't have a transcript for that. 
5 So, , if you can transcribe it, but 
6 we will go ahead and pause the recording during the 
7 playing of the disc. And at this time I'm going to 
8 leave the room because we have a witness here who I 
9 would like to speak with before he testifies. And 
10 
11 
12 
so at this time, , if you want to pause that. 
(This is the playing of the audio 
recording interview of I am also 
13 transcribing it.)

15 We're at the FBI field office 2222 Market

Yes, ma'am. 
So we talked a little bit 
3 before the recording started, but we basically just 
4 want to hear what you know about what happened. So 
5 if you tell us what other people told you that's 
6 fine, but just let us know those are what other 
7 people told you. 
8 We're just looking to find, to figure out, 
9 like I said, what happened, we are just looking for 
10 you to tell us the truth. 
11 We tell everybody who comes in here that 
12 it could be a crime to lie to the FBI, it is a crime 
13 to make material false statements to the FBI. 
14 So I'm not assuming you are going to lie, 
15 but we want you to know that, okay? 
16 Yes, ma'am. 
17 MS. All the answers need to be out 
18 loud, we are making a recording. If we ever do a 
19 transcript or you shake your head, obviously, the 
20 recording doesn't pick that up, okay? 
21 Right. 
22 MS. So if you nod your head you are 
23 going to probably hear me say is that a yes or if 
24 you shake your head I will say is that a no, okay?

2 don't understand a question that we're asking you,

20 and some other young man walking down the street. 
21 And I was just sitting down on the porch just 
22 looking around and I seen the officer approach. Not 
23 sure if he said anything because I'm too for away. 
24 I didn't see or hear anything, but then I seen him

2 And I guess they got into a scuffle, but I 
3 went in the house to get my phone because I was 
4 going to go record it. But I heard a gunshot, so I 
5 raced outside. I went to the other side of the 
6 balcony and then I seen Mike Brown holding himself. 
7 MS. (inaudible) You saw that he had 
8 his hand down around his stomach?

14 which hand it was. 
15 MS. Okay. 
16 I just know he was holding 
17 himself and he turned around towards the officer and 
18 the officer kept firing. And I guess he was, I 
19 don't know if he stepped forward or if he was 
20 falling forward, but as he was falling forward, the
