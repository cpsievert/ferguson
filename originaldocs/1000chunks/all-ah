Yes, sir. 
3 When you, I guess, put the 
4 placards down. 
5 A Correct. 
6 Was there anything that 
7 you found on your own or was everything already 
8 marked? 
9 A No, there were several items that I found 
10 on my own afterwards. 
11 
12 A Yes. 
13 You said that three and 
14 four were .40 caliber spent casings, on the list it 
15 says Federal, what is meant by Federal? 
16 A Federal is a brand name. Federal is the 
17 name of the brand that is actually stamped on the 
18 tail end of the bullet.

8 placard that's number one, that has a scale printed 
9 on it to show size. And that's the black and yellow 
10 white bracelet. 
11 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now at this time, do you 
12 know if that bracelet has anything to do with your 
13 scene or the incident? 
A No. 14 
15 Q You are photographing things, you're not

17 relation to the incident, they may have no relation

17 might perceive, are you in any way saying that that 
18 was the third shot fired by giving that number 
19 three?

1 with a number on it that you put in your magazine in 
2 a numeric way? 
3 A No, they do not. 
4 Q It would help you if they did, correct? 
5 A Tremendously so. These things, the 
6 numbers, the placards in any of my photos and most 
7 anyone they have nothing to do with the order in 
8 which things were done during a crime. They are 
9 specifically the order in which we found that piece 
10 of evidence, and the number that's assigned to it is 
11 just to help us determine which piece of evidence it 
12 is. Has no other chronological significance. 
13 Q So in your report you refer to that this

5 what direction it is facing? 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify something 
7 here. We will have ballistics people, let me ask 
8 you detective, are you trained in firearms? 
9 A Yes, I am a firearms instructor for our 
10 police department. 
11 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So you feel that it is 
12 within your expertise to talk about, this is called 
13 a cartridge; is that right? 
A Casing. 14 
15 Q A casing. You are able to answer her

17 A Yes, ma'am, I can do that.

19 A As far as the direction the bullet is 
20 facing, I can't tell you, but as far as what you 
21 would determine the front would be where the actual 
22 bullet itself would come from, would be this hollow 
23 end of the shell casing.

1 handgun goes through that process, how casings are 
2 ejected, it doesn't happen every time they fire a 
3 bullet. How far do you think they might travel, 
4 anything about that for people that are not familiar 
5 with that? You might want to address that. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You know what, I would like 
7 to talk about in answer to your question is his 
8 familiarity with cartridges and shell casings and 
9 projectiles and firing pins because he can testify 
10 about that, but as far as like how they're ejected 
11 from a particular gun, how far they travel, I 
12 believe we had this conversation before today, you 
13 feel that is outside of your area of expertise? 
14 
15 
A Far outside. 
MS. ALIZADEH: If you want to ask him 
16 questions about how, what the components what we 
17 normally think of is a bullet what are the 
18 components, what happens to it when it is fired, I 
19 think he can answer that. 
20 Just to rephrase, one of 
21 these casings is ejected every time this weapon is 
22 fired, this particular weapon is fired, correct?

1 Are we also to 
2 expect all of these listings for a casing are from 
3 Officer Wilson's gun at the time. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: We will have testimony that 
5 will talked about their comparison. As you recall 
6 he talked about taking items of evidence to the lab 
7 and our laboratory has a ballistics section. So at 
8 some point you will hear about the testing that they 
9 did and they will refer to this as evidence item 
10 three, but to make it even more confusing for you, 
11 the lab will give it it's own number. It will be 
12 like Q7 or something. 
13 But there will always be paperwork to show 
14 that this shell casing right there was picked up by 
15 this officer and put in an envelope and it is 
16 forever his evidence item number three. It might 
17 have another lab number that the lab uses and then 
18 someone who is going to testify about what they did 
19 with this and what conclusions they draw from their 
20 examination.

2 A Correct, you can still see the placards 
3 for one, two and three. 
4 Q Okay. 
5 A Image 44. In the previous image I was 
6 standing on the southern side of the road looking 
7 north, and you can see item number four. 
8 What they typically will do again in 
9 a perfect world is you always try to angle your 
10 placards all facing the same direction. So if you 
11 are standing in the middle of the road, you can see 
12 the number of each one because they are basically a 
13 triangle. And turned to the side you can't see what 
14 number it is on. 
15 So in this photo all I did was turn 
16 or moved to my left a little bit so you can see the 
17 front of the evidence placard.

19 Image Number 43, and you can kind of see it in this

6 the next photo, this is an overall view of evidence 
7 item number eight, I think the last one we had was 
8 number five. Again, the ideal world you can 
9 photograph everything in sequential order. I 
10 believe items number six and seven were farther down 
11 the street. So at the time that this photo was 
12 taken, I didn't want to move down the street and 
13 then move back. Eight and nine were right in front 
14 of the car. 
15 I stayed in this area to continue 
16 with the photograph, this overall view. What we are 
17 looking at here is a red stain on the driver's door.

19 we would use as a placard. There is some adhesive 
20 removable stickers that are numbered one through 
21 zero or one through nine and zero that we can make 
22 combination of numbers. Obviously, this is 
23 something that we would typically stick on a vehicle

You open up those? 
One time use. 
You throw them away when you're done? 
Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Sheila Whirley. What do you 
19 do with those items like number eight and number 
20 nine that you seize once you seize them, what do you 
21 do with them? 
22 A Number eight, since I was able to take it 
23 off with as a whole with tweezers, it was put on a 
24 piece of what we refer to as way paper, kind of wax 
25 paper. This is in our sterilized kit. It is folded

1 so it doesn't get lost. And that folded piece of 
2 wax paper is then placed inside of a coin envelope 
3 and that envelope is sealed. 
4 Item number nine, since we use 
5 Q-Tips, we have these basically long Q-Tip boxes and 
6 again, they are provided by our crime lab. They 
7 come from a sterile environment, they are inside our 
8 DNA kit. You don't handle them without gloves. 
9 Each individual swab, be it a touch DNA swab or 
10 swabbing of a red stain or buccal swab to collect 
11 someone's DNA goes into its own individual swab box. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And then what do you do with 
13 it? 
14 A Once they are in the swab box, they go in 
15 an evidence envelope. 
16 
17 A 
MS. WHIRLEY: For the purpose of? 
Sealing that as my piece of evidence and 
18 taking it to the crime lab and keeping it as sterile 
19 as I can.

MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you. That was all.

57. This is a series of photos that I'm 
23 attempting to show the driver's side mirror being 
24 pushed outside of its natural position. This is

1 investigation just because we were told that there 
2 was a struggle in and/or around the police car. 
3 This was an item of evidence like hey, that mirror 
4 may have been pushed during the struggle. You make 
5 sure to note that in your photos. 
6 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So this would be an 
7 example that somebody had pointed out this may have 
8 some relevance to the actual incident and so go 
9 ahead and photograph that and document it? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So the mirror on that police car, is it a 
12 mirror that can move? You don't break it by moving 
13 it? 
14 A No, it is not broken, it is like many new 
15 cars nowadays, it swivels and moves front to back. 
16 Q If you are sitting in the driver's seat, 
17 the mirror is pushed forward to the front of the 
18 vehicle? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
If you are sitting in the driver's seat, 
21 you can't use that side mirror at that point to 
22 check?

1 driver's side mirror pushed to the front.

Q 
A 
And this thing right here, what's that? 
That would be the spotlight that's 
4 accessible from the driver's side you operate with 
5 your left hand. 
6 Is that mirror intact or 
7 is it broken? 
8 A It is intact. The next photo is a little 
9 bit closer up so you can it. 
10 Is the driver's 
11 side window open or closed, I've haven't been able 
12 to tell in the photos? 
13 
14 
15 
A It is not there right now, it is down. 
It is open. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Did you determine that the 
16 window was broken? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
It had been broken out. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) The driver's side window 
19 is broken and there is no glass in the door frame of 
20 the driver's side window; is that correct? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And then 
Actually, the glass, the broken glass is 
24 still within the door frame itself, but as far as 
25 intact window that would be able to roll up and roll

1 down or be halfway up is not there. 
2 To clarify there is no 
3 glass fragments outside the car or inside the car, 
4 it was all contained within the vehicle. 
5 A No, we talked about this. There is 
6 definitely glass inside the car. You can see broken 
7 glass in the seat and the floorboard. To my 
8 knowledge, I do not remember glass outside of the 
9 car. 
10 Image 59, it is much clearer than the 
11 actual photograph, it is a closer up view of that 
12 mirror. You can also see item number eight is still 
13 on the car as of this time. 
14 Image Number 60. Several things you 
15 can see in this video again, it is still

Q 
A 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Photograph? 
I did say video. Image, you can see in 
18 this image, you can still see the crime scene tape 
19 is there. Evidence item number eight with the 
20 placard or sticker is still next to it. Nine, I 
21 believe, is now underneath this crime scene tape. 
22 What we are focusing on in this photograph is a 
23 defect to the exterior side of this door.

25 same defect. This would be the handle to the

1 driver's side front door. It is just below. 
2 Image 62, a view straight on to the 
3 defect with my scale in the photo to show size and 
4 shape. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Let's back up here for a 
6 second. I think you need a break, he's the one 
7 whose fingers are flying a million miles an hour. 
8 Let me just finish up talking about this and we can 
9 take a little break for sure and everybody else can 
10 get up and take a break. 
11 So this defect that's on the outside 
12 of the driver's door or Officer Darren Wilson's 
13 vehicle.

Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so this door is metal, correct? 
Yes. 
Can you describe what that defect appears 
18 or looks like to you, not what you concluded it is, 
19 but describe it? 
20 A For lack of a better term, this is convex, 
21 it is coming out of the vehicle. It is not a dent 
22 in the vehicle. And it is also, it is hard to tell 
23 again what you are seeing up there. 
24 It is not a stain that's on the 
25 vehicle, you can tell that paint has come off of the

1 vehicle. Something from the outside or from the 
2 inside coming out made that defect to the exterior.

4 what you are looking at there?

8 
A 
Q 
A 
From the outside of the vehicle? 
From the outside of the car? 
No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Any questions about 
9 this. Okay. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Is there a hole from the 
11 inside looking out? 
12 A There is. 
13 Why is it 
14 not notated on here? 
15 
16 
17 
A It is not a piece of evidence. 
It isn't. 
A The vehicle was taken as a piece of 
18 evidence and processed at the crime lab by another 
19 detective, but at the scene that's just a visual 
20 note that I was taking. It wasn't a piece of 
21 evidence that I could collect. 
22 Okay. It is notated in 
23 your paperwork?

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. We'll take a break 
2 here. Let me check on the timing of your lunch. 
3 (Recess) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: This is Kathy Alizadeh. It 
5 is 11:30, we just took about a ten minute break. 
6 Detective is still testifying. Sheila 
7 Whirley, she's left the room but everyone else that 
8 was present when we began is still present in the 
9 room. 
10 I want to tell you that your food is 
11 scheduled to be here at noon. is just going 
12 to knock on the door when the food is here. At that 
13 point, I will try to kind of finish up, if he's not 
14 done, we're going to get to a part where I can make 
15 a logical pause and you will be given your lunch. 
16 It might seem like oh, let's go ahead and 
17 eat while we are hearing testimony. One, you need a 
18 break, I think it is good that you take a little 
19 time for lunch, whether it is 30 minutes or an hour, 
20 that's up to you. 
21 Also, some of these photographs are not 
22 going to be things you want to see when you are 
23 eating lunch, of course. Ready to get started? 
24 Officer , what is your next 
25 photograph?

Next photograph is Image Number 63. This 
2 is again, what I took an overall photo and what we 
3 are going to zoom in on is hand impression that is 
4 on the rear of Darren Wilson's police car. This is 
5 from east looking west on Canfield. This is my 
6 crime scene van at the edge of the crime scene. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. 
8 A Image 64, rear of the vehicle, the rear 
9 glass of the vehicle. This would be kind of the 
10 left side or driver's side of the vehicle on the 
11 rear lift gate. 
12 Again, it is hard to see from this, 
13 not only this photograph but kind of this angle it 
14 looks like a couple handprint impressions kind of on 
15 the glass. 
16 65. What I did in this image is I 
17 moved just to my left a little bit to combat the 
18 reflection of the sunlight, daylight that was there 
19 to get a better image of what I was seeing in person 
20 to describe what this is. It is not a bloody 
21 handprint, it is not a muddy handprint, it would be 
22 if the window was clean and somebody slapped a wet 
23 hand on there and went down a dusty road, all it is 
24 is a dust impression of a hand. 
25 After I photographed this, almost
