Q Why did you need to set up a time? 1 
2 A Because other officers are responding to 
3 the scene, St. Louis County detectives, their ID 
4 unit, that may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 
5 several hours before I could actually get in and 
6 actually see the body.

That's 2:30. In about an hour. Is there

15 A No, ma'am, just waited. I called them 
16 about 2:15, they said they were showing up, the ID 
17 people were there showing up. So I went ahead and 
18 responded to the scene.

20 needed to do?

2 people there. He was deceased, was laying in the 
3 middle of the street. There was already some orange 
4 barriers around him to keep the crowd from seeing 
5 him. 
6 Q Was the crowd saying anything? 
7 A They were just, I don't know how to

Yes. 
Do you know what that meant?

23 like, the body, was it covered, uncovered? 
24 A He was covered with several white sheets 
25 laying in the prone position.

Other than? 
Anything? 
In looking at the report, I would like to 
8 clarify, the east and west position of the body may 
9 not be accurate, may not be correct. I was just 
10 going by the street that I came in on, that I came 
11 down. It should have been an east and west street. 
12 So that should have been west and his feet should 
13 have been east. 
14 Sometimes in a subdivision the 
15 streets, they curve, so his head may be a little bit 
16 off. Like southwest, and his feet may be northeast 
17 or something in a different report, but I should say 
18 that the head was pointing towards Florissant and 
19 his feet was, what's the name of the other street, 
20 the other main intersection that I came in on to get 
21 to Canfield.

I can't think of the street right now. 
Okay. Is there anything else looking at

Q

Not that I can think of. 
When you are writing your report, if there 
3 is something that you discover later, do you write a 
4 supplemental? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Can you recall an instance where you did 
7 write a supplemental? You don't have to tell us the 
8 name of the case or anything. 
9 A Cases like, maybe on this kind of case 
10 like this, maybe the doctor asked us what was he 
11 doing before this happened. I would have to go 
12 back, contact an officer, maybe his family and find 
13 out why he was with so and so doing something or you 
14 know, whatever he was doing prior to his death. I 
15 may have to go back and get that information. 
16 They may call me, the doctor may ask 
17 me, can you call the family to see if they have any 
18 kind of medical history, and things of that nature. 
19 Q Okay. And getting back again because one 
20 other thing I want to ask you about the injuries, 
21 did you count the gunshot wounds? 
22 A 
23 wounds. 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am, what I thought was gunshot 
Clarify what you mean? 
Just because there is a hole in a person

1 doesn't actually mean it came from a bullet.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
It could be a stabbing, could have fallen 
4 on a rock, could be a laceration. 
5 Q But you counted a certain amount of wounds 
6 that may or may not have been gunshot wounds?
