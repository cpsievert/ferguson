Yes. 
Okay. Did you see, at the time of the 
11 shooting, were there any other police vehicles 
12 there? 
13 A No, when he first got shot he was laying 
14 there I seen another police car pull up probably 
15 about ten minutes later. It wasn't that long after 
16 the police car pulled up. So there was two police 
17 cars out there, they eventually, I guess they told 
18 the cop that shot him to go home because he wasn't 
19 out there after a couple of minutes. 
20 Q Did that car that showed up, did it have 
21 its head bar lights on too?

2 investigators? 
3 A Honestly? 
4 Q Honestly. 
5 A I was at home enjoying myself watching a 
6 movie and there's a knock on the door, and two big 
7 guys with FBI things on. I told my boyfriend to get 
8 the door, I don't want to talk to anybody, go get 
9 the door. 
10 So he answered the doors and says, I 
11 was at work on that day, but my girlfriend was here 
12 and saw the whole thing so. Oh, really, can we come 
13 inside? I couldn't say no, the first thing he said 
14 was just say no. So figure you can't say no to an 
15 FBI agent. So, yeah, that's how it went. 
16 Q Okay. So had you told your boyfriend 
17 about what happened that day? 
18 A Yeah, I told him because his son was 
19 coming over. When she finally did get there, she 
20 said, did you know somebody got shot? I was like, 
21 yeah, I was just out there.

Q Did you think this was police brutality? 
A Honestly, to me it looked like murder. 
11 I've seen the Ferguson police do some really awful 
12 things. I've personally myself filed cases against 
13 them for them coming into my house and basically 
14 beating me up. 
Q Okay. Tell us about that? 15

6 arrived, which was not that, it was like two minutes 
7 later, like they was literally parked down the 
8 street. When they arrived he was standing in the 
9 doorway. 
10 They walked straight up to him, they 
11 didn't ask questions, they grabbed him, put him in 
12 cuffs, told him to get on his knees. Like how am I 
13 going to get on my knees when you're twisting my arm 
14 up in the air. 
15 They pushing his face all up on the 
16 wall. Me and her are in there crying, he didn't do

12 nothing to me, this has nothing to do with you, this 
13 is a police matter now. 
14 Q They called you the B word? 
15 A Yes. The Canfield security officer, he 
16 came in, come on man, these are kids. Don't do them 
17 like that. You shut up because this is a police 
18 matter, we're taking over this investigation and

1 there is the same way. 
2 What I see when the police come, it 
3 is like instant panic from people. You know, like 
4 who called them, why would you call them over here. 
5 We don't need them to solve this problem, you just 
6 brought more trouble into the area and stuff like 
7 that. 
8 And I just see like, I mean, I seen 
9 my daddy get beat by the police, I've seen friends 
10 of mine will be out, you know, shopping and someone 
11 told them we stole something and just get followed 
12 by the police cars. I never seen, you know, I don't 
13 think he deserves to get killed like that. And that 
14 just kind of proves my whole image of what I thought 
15 of the police. 
16 Q Which is what? 
17 A They abuse their authority to me.

2 experienced or witnessed or that you are aware of 
3 other Ferguson officers? 
4 A No, I don't hold him accountable really. 
5 I think, you know, like I say with authorities, I 
6 think he just got beside himself. Like, you know, 
7 it turned into, you know, I'm going to tell you kids 
8 you do this, you listen to me, you have an attitude. 
9 And then it turned into him just being frustrated, 
10 that's what it seemed like. 
11 Q Okay. What I want to make sure, 
12 and because this grand jury is going to consider 
13 whether or not to indict the police officer for a 
14 crime. And they're examining what happened that day 
15 so that they can decide that, and I know that you 
16 having had unpleasant or, you know, very bad 
17 experiences with police officers, you know, it gives 
18 you a bad impression of police officers I imagine.

13 did you see any people outside? 
14 A No, I don't remember. I wasn't paying
