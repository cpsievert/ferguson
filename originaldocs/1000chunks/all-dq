13 though?

A 
Yeah, a lot smaller. 
Could have been a women? 
Yeah, and then when we were driving out, 
6 when I looked over and seen Michael's shoes, there

8 believe it was a woman cop.

A 
Q 
Yeah. 
You really can't say that female police 
21 officer that you saw was the same officer that you 
22 described that might be a woman? 
23 A Yeah, well, it all happened so fast and 
24 then they were out of there. I can only catch just 
25 a little bit, you know. I'm not even real sure the

1 other guy had a mustache. He was one of the three 
2 that I could look at that wasn't like the other one. 
3 This is the one that talked first. I mean, I seen 
4 this twice so. 
5 Q All right. So after you say you saw 
6 Michael turn around and he had his hands in the 
7 manner that you demonstrated and he said okay, okay, 
8 okay, okay, several times and then you see these 
9 three officers, are they coming down the street? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q And how are they moving, are they are 
12 running, walking? 
13 A Pretty swift. They weren't running, but 
14 it was a pretty quick walk. 
15 Q And you said that the officer that was in 
16 front had his weapon drawn and you were kind of with 
17 your motion with your hands like this somewhat? 
18 (indicating) 
19 A Yeah, he was pointing it down towards the 
20 street until he got within about 10 feet of Michael. 
21 Q Did these three officers continue to move 
22 in Michael's direction? 
23 A The two slowed down when he started 
24 shooting. 
25 Q When who started shooting, the officer

emptied, the 
7 other guy pulled his gun for probably a couple of 
8 seconds until Michael fell. Once he fell then they 
9 put it away and whisked the other guy out of there. 
10 Q Okay. So now as you say the other 
11 officers were moving swiftly toward Michael and 
12 Michael had turned around. 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Did Michael move in a direction? 
He was still catching his balance from 
16 standing up and he was coming towards him, but it 
17 wasn't like he was running towards him. 
18 Q Okay. How many steps did he take towards 
19 the officers? 
20 A By the time the shot was, I'd say about 
21 four, maybe five to catch up on his balance. 
22 Q And was he, when you said that he was kind 
23 of catching himself, was he, you kind of had hands 
24 up, but you were kind of going forward, was he 
25 falling at that point?

1 A No, he was just. I think he was a big kid 
2 and was coming up. I thought that he had been shot, 
3 so I don't know what it feels like to be shot. So 
4 maybe wherever he got shot was kind of bothering him 
5 too. He wasn't really falling, he was just --
6 Q He was moving towards the officers? 
7 A He was moving towards the officer. 
8 Q Okay. And you said about how many steps, 
9 three or four? 
10 A Yeah, there was like no gap between his 
11 heel and toe, he was just kind of staggering 
12 forward. 
13 Q And then what happened after he moved 
14 three or four steps? 
15 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
A 
Then the officers got up to him. 
What does that mean? 
Well, by that time the officer was there, 
18 as soon as the officer got there, I didn't hear the 
19 officer say anything because he was yelling okay and 
20 then just pulled up and started shooting. 
21 Q So the officer you're talking about who 
22 pulled up and started shooting was the one who had 
23 his gun drawn? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So how close was he to Michael Brown when

1 you saw him starting to shoot? 
2 A About 10 foot when he started and about 
3 five to seven feet when he ended. 
4 Q How many, now this is after those first 
5 two shots, this is the second? 
6 A This would have been the third, fourth, 
7 fifth, sixth. 
8 Q Okay. How many shots do you think at that 
9 time? 
10 A I think it was seven, and the reason I 
11 think that is most officers carry guns with nine 
12 bullets. So if there was two to start with and then 
13 he emptied his gun, that would have been seven. 
14 Q Okay. So, now, this is where I don't want 
15 you to get into assuming things. 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
I can tell you that his gun didn't carry 
18 nine bullets?

Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
So don't get stuck on a number --
Oh, no, no, no. 
-- or make an assumption. Think in your 
23 head how many shots you think you heard? 
24 A My first guess was six or seven, when I 
25 first --

then 
A Real quick. 
Q Or was there a pause? 
A Real quick. 
Q So it wasn't like three and then pause and 
three more or six or four more? 
A Real quick. All of that happened so fast, 
12 I think I was probably in shock at what I just 
13 witnessed and I didn't know what to think was going 
14 on.
