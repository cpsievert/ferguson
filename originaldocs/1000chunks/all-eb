Yes. 
Was Michael Brown's body covered? 
No. 
Did you see the officer? 
I couldn't recall, but I did, there was a 
21 couple officers there. I don't know if he called 
22 backup at first when it first got started or 
23 something.

3 was more than one officer there?

5 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. Do you think you got a good 
6 enough look at the officer that shot Michael Brown 
7 that you would know which one is which? 
8 A I couldn't even tell. The only thing I 
9 can remember is he had on a black hat, and I think 
10 had on glasses, that's the only thing I can honestly 
11 remember. 
12 Q Okay, so backup, I don't know if I 
13 understood you. He had on what? 
14 A A black hat, like a black regular hat and 
15 some glasses. 
16 
17 
18 
Q 
A

A black hat and glasses? 
Yes. I guess his police uniform.

19 officer that shot Michael Brown? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Was he wearing a black hat and glasses 
22 when he shot him?

With the hat on, could you tell what his 
2 hair looked like? 
3 A No, I could not. 
4 Q And so at some point then you said you 
5 went to Northwinds to tell Michael Brown's family? 
6 A Yes, really I went up to go talk to his 
7 granny. By the time I came down, his auntie was 
8 already coming up the street, and I couldn't see, I 
9 guess --
10 Q So you went to tell his grandmother what 
11 happened? 
12 A Yes. By the time I got to Northwinds, she 
13 was already walking out of her parking lot. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
The grandmother or the aunt? 
The grandmother. I had walked past the 
16 aunt, I gave her a hug, she bust out crying. And 
17 then I'm like, where's grandma? I don't know, I 
18 think she's down there. 
19 So I'm walking towards my house, 
20 again, she lives directly across the street from me. 
21 And by the time I got to her parking lot, she was 
22 already walking. 
23 Q So when you first talked to the police on 
24 the 13th.

1 Q That was because they came to your house, 
2 right? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q So you never said anything to the police 
5 or called them and say, hey, I saw it, I need to 
6 talk? 
7 A I did not. I was more intimidated because 
8 after what I had saw and then I was at a family 
9 member's house that lives in Jennings. 
10 And my mother called me and she was 
11 like, the police are looking for you. I'm like, for 
12 what? She was like, I don't know. Even my 
13 neighbors told me. They told me there was people at 
14 the back door, police officers at the back door at 
15 my side windows and at the front door. I don't know 
16 how many it was, but people was calling me and 
17 warning me. Like they said, they came to my house 
18 like I'm the one that had something to do with 
19 killing him.

1 A That wasn't necessary if only thing you 
2 want to do is talk to me. 
3 Q All right. And I understand you were not 
4 wanting to come talk to the police, I get that. But 
5 at some point you did go and talk to the police and 
6 you told them about what you saw? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And you admit today that at lot of what 
9 you told them on that day you didn't really see it? 
10 A Yes, it was more of me just finding out 
11 stuff here and there. 
12 Q , did you feel any pressure from 
13 other people in the complex or Michael Brown's 
14 family or did you feel like it was an obligation 
15 that you had to say that you saw those things when 
16 you really didn't? 
17 A I didn't think it was, I don't think 
18 nobody would lie about something. 
19 So in my mind, I honestly believe 
20 that's what happened.

No, I didn't. I didn't hear about 
You didn't hear about that? 
No. 
You originally told the officers, or told 
7 the police that you saw the officer stand over Mike 
8 Brown after he fell in the street and stand over him 
9 and shoot him four more times. 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, that is what I was told, yes. 
And that would mean he had gunshot wounds 
12 in his back, right? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
I guess. 
He's laying on his front, right, facedown.

23 could say it was more than five.

Is there anything else that you think this

4 about? 
5 A It's just about, not just, I've been 
6 dealing with, trust me, I've lived out in Ferguson 
7 for, I can honestly say about almost six years. 
8 Harassment, yes, I dealt through that growing up 
9 over there in that area. 
10 I was even like pulled off of my 
11 school bus one time telling me I broke in someone's 
12 house. And when I asked them why would I break in 
13 someone's house when I was at school, it is always 
14 harassment. They pull up on you and just ask you 
15 questions. Where you going and just all type of, 
16 just harassment like. 
17 I should be able to live, I should be 
18 able to feel safe where I live. I've got nephews 
19 growing up around this area. I feel like it's not 
20 the right environment for kids to even have to grow 
21 up like. Even Michael Brown being shot, that was a 
22 regular day, people walking dogs, kids out there 
23 playing, that's not the type of scene for anything 
24 to go down like that. 
25 And then to leave him sitting outside

1 for hours so the whole community can see it, kids 
2 and all, I feel like that's the most form of 
3 disrespect. Not just to Michael Brown, but to his 
4 family. That's not something they should just have 
5 to sit there and look at. 
6 And then another thing, for his 
7 memorial to be burnt down and for me to honestly see 
8 that with my own eyes, his memorial going up in 
9 flames. Like there was gasoline poured on it. Like 
10 they tried to say on the news, I don't know if they 
11 said on the news, but they said that candles started 
12 the memorial to burn it down. 
13 Now, I'm out there, I live out there 
14 every day. The candles are always in the middle of 
15 the street. There was not a candle over there by 
16 the light pole for it to blow up and make that type 
17 of explosion and it's on videotape. One of my 
18 family members actually got a video tape of it, he 
19 put it on viral, he put it on Facebook viral. 
20 For me to go out and see two 
21 Caucasian Ferguson officers sitting by my sister's

3 And he already got killed, people

16 through out there at Ferguson. 
17 Q But it has opened a lot of people's eyes 
18 about what really has been going on. And I

15 of any situations where he told you a story that he 
16 had been harassed? 
17 A Not him personally, but me, yes. Not with 
18 him, but we were harassed by -- because Northwinds 
19 has and Canfield have security guards. We both were 
20 harassed by the security guards that legally got the 
21 right to hold guns and all that type of thing. 
22 Police-wise me and him together, no. If I was ever

3 something to do with her going to the hospital or if 
4 it was just a whole bunch of stuff just adding up. 
5 But, yeah, she was in the hospital at the time,

2 used to have to tell me to calm down and stop being

4 We didn't do nothing. We did smoke

13 like what they call ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, 
14 hyperactivity, or anything of that nature? 
15 A ADD is when you like can't stop moving and 
16 got to move around all the time. 
17 Well, yeah, lose focus. 
18 A No, he was more of a home body. I used to 
19 have to like go get him and make him put on clothes 
20 and walk to the store like. And really and truly 
21 his granny was overprotective of him. 
22 At that time I was one of them like 
23 why is she overprotective, now I know. Now after 
24 the fact, I know why she was being so overprotective 
25 of him.

MS. WHIRLEY: Why was it? 
Because of situations like this. Because 
3 if you notice, the people that don't deserve it, it 
4 usually happens to them. He didn't deserve it. 
5 There's been testimony 
6 that in speaking with Michael and he was giving a 
7 response back to somebody, that Michael would have 
8 the action of raising his head and fluttering his 
9 eyes while giving a response and doing that 
10 repetitively, you know, whenever he gave a response, 
11 he would raise up his head and, you know, flutter 
12 his eyes. Was that a common practice that you 
13 noticed of him?

to that 
honestly 
meant it 
was deep 
I honestly, I never really paid attention 
type of thing. I honestly didn't. I can't 
say I have. But whatever he say he usually 
and whenever he said something, it usually 
and had meaning behind. 
All right. Thank you, 
MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to ask you 
22 something because we talked about, you know, knowing 
23 something about Michael Brown because, obviously, 
24 none of us knew him and you knew him very well. 
25 A Yes.

1 MS. ALIZADEH: Have you seen or have you 
2 heard that there was video that was aired that 
3 showed Michael Brown stealing some Cigarillos. 
4 A Me, honestly, I wasn't there. I ain't 
5 never see the tape so I can't honestly speak on 
6 that, I really can't. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Would you think that 
8 that was out of character for him? 
9 
10 
A Honestly, I don't think that was the case. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So you don't think that he 
11 did that? 
12 A No, I can't really speak on it, I didn't 
13 see the tape or anything. It was just a lot of 
14 speculation I heard. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I'm saying if you 
assume that that was him in the video. 
A Me, personally, I couldn't see him doing 
nothing like that, no. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So that would be something

16 
17

19 
20 
21 
you wouldn't expect Michael Brown to do?

22 he was, at least around me.

24 before?

3 drugs?

A 
A 
No, usually he would just fall asleep. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
He usually just fall asleep and I fall 
7 asleep right along with him. And she would come in 
8 there waking us up and kick me out of the house like 
9 she always do. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: Did you ever know him to 
11 have like a quick temper? 
12 A No, I'm the one with the quick temper. It 
13 was usually always him telling me to calm down. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: So like never heard about 
15 him getting in any fights or anything like that? 
16 
17 
A No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. All right. 
18 So you 
19 say you don't know why he couldn't live with his 
20 family, it was none of your business. I don't mean 
21 to disrespect your friend, the problem I have with 
22 that is you say he's your best friend and he is 
23 living with your sister who is pregnant and has two 
24 small children in the home. 
25 A Yes.

1 And you never thought to 
2 ask him why he couldn't live with his family member, 
3 did you think it could be some type of volatile 
4 situation your family could be put into? 
5 A No, cause I didn't think about it like 
6 that. We was together all day anyway, so my sister 
7 was the one that told me it wasn't no problem with 
8 him coming over. 
9 Okay. And you did say 
10 that you did 
11 A As long as I've known him, he was never 
12 living with his mother from the get-go. He was 
13 always living with his grandmother, that's how we 
14 met from his grandmother's house because we went to 
15 school together. 
16 You don't know why his 
17 grandmother was in the hospital, could it possibly 
18 have been from their argument? 
19 A I don't know. I don't know if it was 
20 slowly just building up, building up, I don't know 
21 if she was depressed, whatever sent her to the 
22 hospital. At that point in time she was in the 
23 hospital for a few days. 
24 This is his grandmother, 
25 he told you he stormed out and left, he couldn't

1 live with her. 
A Yes, they was arguing. 2 
3 Again, I don't mean to 
4 talk bad about your friend, you feel like that is 
5 okay behavior to do with his grandmother, find it 
6 hard to believe he had similar behavior with a 
7 stranger? 
8 A No, it is not like that cause I was going 
9 through problems with my mother at the time also, 
10 that's why I was living down at my sister's house. 
11 I really don't know what their 
12 problem was, but I know I was already going through 
13 my own little situation to be in his life at that 
14 time. I just knew he was my friend and I was going 
15 to look out for him. I guess just the way I know he 
16 would look out for me. 
17 Regardless? 
18 A Yes. 
19 I have on page 16 of your 
20 recorded statement, you said with his hands on his 
21 knees like this. 
22 And then later you said he was on his 
23 knee, he was on his knee, he was on his knees, and 
24 then today you say he was on his knees with his 
25 hands up. Those are three very different.

1 A No, I know what I said, and I said he was 
2 on his knees with his hands up. When I looked out 
3 the window every single time that part has never 
4 changed. 
5 So you are saying that 
6 what we heard is wrong, what we heard you say? 
7 A I said every time he had his hands up in 
8 the air on his knees. I can vouch for that, I know 
9 specifically what I said. 
10 Okay. And today you said 
11 that you heard Michael tell Dorian Johnson to run 
12 for his life and you saw Dorian Johnson leave. Now 
13 today you are saying you didn't see Dorian until you 
14 went downstairs. Did you not actually hear him say 
15 run for your life? 
16 
17 
18 
A 
A 
I didn't, that's what Dorian told me. 
Okay. 
He said that's the last thing he heard him 
19 say, "Bro, run for your life." 
20 Okay. So, again today, 
21 let me just check, because I don't remember you 
22 telling us in today's statement that Michael was 
23 pleading for his life. Because in your past 
24 statement you said you heard Michael pleading for 
25 his life. Please don't shoot, please don't shoot,

2 A It is just like what I told her earlier, 
3 she told me not stuff that I heard and I admitted 
4 the first interview was most speculation and stuff 
5 that I heard either from Dorian, neighbors, it was 
6 just a whole lot of talk. 
7 And that's why I'm asking 
8 you because we don't know, there is three different 
9 things that you said and I'm going to ask you this 
10 as well, it is a hard question for me to ask, but 
11 the first one you have admitted is not really what 
12 happened. 
13 A Yes. 
14 And the second one, which 
15 is a little less intricate, yeah, it happened, but 
16 not so much. How are we, in the first statement you 
17 even told somebody to look into your soul and to 
18 look into your eyes, that you would never ever lie, 
19 how do we know that today's statement is the truth? 
20 A It is not a lie if the person was actually 
21 there, told me exactly what happened. So I didn't 
22 feel like it was a lie. I didn't feel like it was a 
23 lie at all. And the way that Dorian came to me, the 
24 look he gave me in his eyes, he wouldn't lie to me 
25 about something like that knowing that that was my

1 best friend. 
2 So you don't feel what 
3 you said on the first interview was a lie because 
4 somebody you trusted told you the truth? 
5 A I don't think it was a lie, no. 
6 You don't believe you 
7 lied? 
8 
9 
10 
A No, I don't. 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Just to clarify then. 
11 After that question, you didn't hear Michael 
12 pleading for his life? 
13 
14 
A No, that's what I was told. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So from where you 
15 were you could hear the gunshots? 
16 
17 
A Yes, that's the only thing I could hear. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You couldn't hear, you 
18 didn't hear the officer say anything?

20 
A 
21 anything?

1 A No, he told me what happened after the

3 And this is again. 
4 I'm sorry, , but are you telling us that the 
5 only thing that's true about all of your statements

15 about 5 feet or so from the car, the police officer, 
16 correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 And you also explained 
19 that immediately after it happened you were down 
20 there, were you able to see exactly where that 
21 police car was located? 
22 A It was a few feet away from them, pointing 
23 towards West Florissant. Like it was coming from 
24 Northwinds.

1 laser where you saw that car as soon as you walked 
2 out? 
3 A Michael Brown was right here, the car had 
4 to be where the C was at. If he was right here, it 
5 had to be in front of the C or where the C was at. 
6 So if we had photograph 
7 evidence and again, the FBI, if we have evidence 
8 showing the car is not in that location, how would 
9 you explain that? 
10 A Urn, really and truly, where the car was 
11 located really doesn't have anything to do with what 
12 honestly happened because he was unarmed, he didn't 
13 put up a fight, and he was assassinated for what 
14 reason. So, honestly, what does the car have to do 
15 with it? 
16 The only reason 
17 I ask that is if the car was not moved and it was in 
18 that location that we've seen the photographs, then 
19 you would have been able to see any altercation if 
20 there was a fight by the car?
