14 A I couldn't see what he had in his hands, 
15 his back was to me. 
16 Q Okay. And so, now as you look and you 
17 said you saw the officer, did you also, when you 
18 first looked, could you also see Michael Brown? 
19 A Yes, my first, that was my first view of 
20 Michael Brown. He was in direct line just past the 
21 officer and he was pointing in our direction.

Okay. You never saw the back of him? 
No, I did not. 
Okay. 
He appeared to be pointing directly at the 
6 vehicle we were in, he was pointing at the officer 
7 in the officer's direction and because of our point 
8 of view, he appeared to be pointing at us. 
9 Q Okay. Did you see anything in his hands 
10 or anything that he was doing with his hands? 
11 A I believe I saw a flash of light off of 
12 something. 
13 Q Okay. And now you had mentioned earlier,

So that was an impression you got --
Yeah, I was scared the bullets were going

1 saw the officer, did you see him after you heard the 
2 gunshots? 
3 A After. 
4 Q After, okay. So when you saw the officer 
5 and he's moving away from you, could you tell was he 
6 firing a weapon as he was moving away from you? 
7 A Uh, the next shot I heard was after 
8 Michael Brown started running, the officer fired and 
9 I saw Michael Brown stagger and fling his arms out. 
10 At which point he turned around and came back toward 
11 the officer.

Can you stand up and show the grand jurors 
19 how you saw what it looked like he was doing? 
20 A He's about my size, young black guy and he 
21 looked like he was pointing. I can't tell one 
22 finger or two, I can't tell what he had in his hand, 
23 but I thought I saw a glint. I believe it was a 
24 gun.

5 and you see this, describe for me, you can sit down, 
6 we'll go through this again step by step, but 
7 describe for me what you see next happened? 
8 A Well, after seeing him and the officer and 
9 seeing him point and getting this impression that he 
10 was going to start shooting in our direction, uh, 
11 like that, Mr. Brown spun and started to run away 
12 down the street going this direction. 
13 Q Okay. So that would be east down 
14 Canfield? 
15 A Yes, down Canfield away from Florissant 
16 and away from our vehicle. At which point the 
17 officer fired one shot and I saw Mr. Brown stagger.

17 And run where? Q 
18 Down the street. A 
19 So he stayed in the street? Q 
A 20 Urn, he might have been angling toward this 
side of 21 the street, but he was running straight down 
22 the center of the street that's turning, so, he was 
23 running straight away from us.

And so, and you said you thought you saw a 
4 glint in his hand, but did you see anything once he 
5 turned around and was running, did you notice 
6 anything in his hands? 
7 A I thought I saw him throw something or 
8 lose something when the officer wounded him and he, 
9 when he was wounded, he flung his arms out and spun 
10 back around. And I thought something might have 
11 flung from his hands. I wasn't certain at the time 
12 I gave my original statement. This was an 
13 impression that I got that I thought he may or may 
14 not have lost what he had in his hand. 
15 Q Okay. Could you tell when you first saw 
16 Michael Brown, did he have a hat on? 
17 
18 
A

2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then you said, you had said something 
4 about Michael Brown being wounded. 
5 A Yeah, when Mr. Brown was running away from 
6 the officer, one shot was fired. Mr. Brown 
7 staggered a little to the left and his arms went 
8 out. It looked to me like he was shot in the left 
9 leg or low on the left side and he spun around. 
10 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Q 
Did you see any blood coming from him? 
No, I wasn't close enough to see blood. 
So it was just by the way he reacted that 
13 you thought he was shot? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
The way his body jerked. 
Okay. And so you say he spun around, so 
16 when he spun around, was he facing the officer at 
17 that point? 
18 A He spun 180 degrees and came back toward 
19 the officer. 
20 Q All right. When you say he came back 
21 toward the officer? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Several steps back toward the officer. 
Okay. Now, can you stand up again, sorry,

14 this side road here and drove around the back to 
15 house. I still can't remember which one of

8 there on Canfield Drive?

Down and out? 
Yes, and the right arm was higher, 
21 shoulder level as he spun.

Did you ever see Michael Brown put his 
No, I never saw his arms up. 
Never saw his hands up like that? 
Never saw his hands up. 
Other than the way you have demonstrated? 
Only when he flung them out in spinning 
never saw him put his hand up. 
Okay.

1 officer's demeanor when you first saw him and by 
2 that I mean, can you show us what he was doing? You 
3 know, like did he have a gun pointed, was he, what 
4 was he looking like when you first saw him? 
5 A When I first saw him, I was looking at his 
6 back as he was walking away from me or trotting, 
7 toward Mr. Brown. 
8 Q Okay. And from behind, that's what you 
9 could see, could you see his hands from behind, from 
10 his behind, I mean, his behind was facing 
11 A They looked like they were up. He 
12 probably had his, probably had his gun in his hands.

But you couldn't tell where? 
No. 
Okay. And as Michael Brown was running 
5 away, it appeared he had a gun in his hand as he was 
6 running away, because you said? 
7 A I saw, I saw what I thought was something 
8 fly from his hand when he spun, but it was an 
9 impression I got and since my original statement to 
10 the police, I said that I wasn't certain because of 
11 the distance, but I got the impression that 
12 something flew out of his hand when he was struck 
13 and spun around. 
14 Q Okay. So while he's running away, is he 
15 facing you or not? 
16 A His back, because he was running almost 
17 directly away from us down the road. 
18 Q Okay. So both the officers back and his 
19 back was to you as they were running away?

Q 
A 
Okay. 
I saw what I thought was something fly 
4 from his hand when he spun. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And I saw a glint off of something in his 
7 hand when I first saw him because the first time I 
8 laid eyes on Mr. Brown, he was pointing at us. And 
9 I thought I saw a glint off of something in his 
10 hand. 
11 Q Okay. All right. So as he ran and the 
12 officer fired a shot, he thought he was hit, he 
13 staggered? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
He turned around, as you demonstrated for 
16 us how he turned around. 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So once he turned around and he was 
19 walking towards the officer, you said a few steps, 
20 was he staggering still? 
21 A He did not seem to be staggering. He was 
22 walking fairly well. 
23 Q Okay. He no longer seemed to be 
24 staggering?
