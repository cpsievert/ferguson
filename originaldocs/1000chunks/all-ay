3 was collapsing? 
4 A He couldn't get a step off like. When he 
5 was giving his second sentence, what he was going to 
6 say, it was like he was going to step close to the 
7 officer, but like I said, before he could even get

Shots was definitely fired while he was 
down. The last shot he fired he was so close 
ground, it looked like to me he was already 
ground. His knees were, he was going down, 
already down before the last shot came. 
So he never like got on his knees, he was 
18 just falling down? 
19 A He was falling. I can almost feel the 
20 shots because like I said, I've been shot before. 
21 I'm so face-to-face with him being shot, I'm seeing 
22 his eyes blink and all of these different. It is 
23 making me relive the pain of coming through because 
24 I've only been shot one time. 
25 I can see how many shots this officer

1 is firing, it is sickening to my stomach, I'm almost 
2 bursting in tears right there. I threw up a little 
3 in my mouth initially. I got in my head that he's 
4 dead. When I see his body hit the ground, in my 
5 head I say he's dead. 
6 At that time while he's on the 
7 ground, the officer is standing there, he doesn't 
8 look around like he's looking for me or anything 
9 like that, I'm still in plain sight. I never went 
10 anywhere until it clicked back to me that he may 
11 could be looking for you too. 
12 Again, at that time, that's more fear 
13 for my life. I just seen him gun down and kill 
14 someone I was just walking with my friend Big Mike, 
15 I see that, I see with my eyes he killed him. Now 
16 in my head I'm wondering what is he going to do with 
17 me. 
18 Q Let me ask you this. When he stopped 
19 shooting, what did he do, the officer? 
20 A When he stopped shooting, the officer, he 
21 just kind of stood there.

After giving the final shots, the rippling 
4 shots because there is only one rippling shots. 
5 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, he kind of stood 
6 there. And at that time I see him, and I see Big 
7 Mike on the ground, he's not moving, breathing or 
8 anything like that. I see the officer kind of just 
9 standing there, it wasn't for like a full two 
10 seconds when I took off running, I just 
11 Q So you didn't see the officer when he went 
12 back to his car or when he left the scene or 
13 anything like that? 
14 A No, I didn't see him go back to his car or 
15 anything when I took off running. My building is 
16 right here, I was so afraid for my life that I 
17 didn't want to go to any other direction, so I took 
18 this direction all the way, all the way around. I 
19 went the longest way around to my house. 
20 Now, when I got into my apartment, I 
21 wasn't there for a minute or two, my girlfriend is 
22 there, I'm hyperventilating, I'm still throwing up, 
23 I have been throwing up since I started running.

5 A Like I said, when I had got back to my 
6 apartment, hyperventilating, still trying to figure 
7 out. At the scene, I kind of pretty much assumed 
8 that he's dead. But when I ran to my apartment and 
9 I was able to kind of get it together, it wasn't a 
10 minute or two minutes, I came back out to check to 
11 see if he's all right, is he moving or, you know, 
12 did he really get killed. 
13 When I came back out to the street, 
14 you can see where my apartment is, how close the 
15 street is. When I came back out, I came back 
16 straight away. Came back straight away, I got to 
17 about right here and I could still see that Big Mike 
18 was still laying in the street in the same position 
19 he was when he had got shot. But I did not see the 
20 officer any more, I saw his cruiser, his car was 
21 still there, it didn't look like he was inside the 
22 car. 
23 I continued to walk along because now 
24 there is a lot of people outside right now. At this 
25 time when coming back now, there is a lot of people,

2 see any officers on the scene. 
3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) That is what my question 
4 was, so there is no police officers on the scene at 
5 this time when you walk back? 
6 A No, ma'am. 
7 Q So there is no tape of anything? 
8 A No tape, nothing right at the moment. At 
9 the moment of me coming back, there was just Big 
10 Mike laying in the street, his car was still there, 
11 but Darren Wilson himself was not present any more,

3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So the road was open 
4 between Michael Brown and the police cruiser, nobody 
5 else on the road? 
6 A Correct, yes, sir. 
7 At any 
8 time from the first time the officer approached you 
9 and Mr. Brown to the time of his death, did he ever 
10 call for help? 
11 A No, ma'am, the officer never got on his 
12 dispatcher or anything like that. He never even 
13 seemed like he really needed any help. We wasn't 
14 threatening his life in a threatening manner. I 
15 definitely wasn't doing anything like assisting Big

3 Can you tell me were you 
4 down on your knees like this, both knees, one knee 
5 down like this or what? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. I never got down on my knees 
7 so much as crouch down slightly, just a little. I 
8 played football in school, so I got a good crouch. 
9 I was just basically standing there. I'm behind the 
10 car, but I know that I'm not low enough because the 
11 car is so small I didn't really want to get down on 
12 the ground. I was just really trying to stoop. 
13 But once Big Mike looked me in my 
14 face as he is going by and says, hey, keep running,

16 to be, but I could not move because of fear and

1 fire all of these shots as you are pursuing Mike 
2 Brown, what would you say is the cause of that? 
3 Kind of from what you've seen and everything that 
4 happened, why would you say he was pursuing him? 
5 A You are saying why didn't he fire the 
6 shots from the beginning or from the last couple 
7 shots? 
8 He is out of the vehicle 
9 and he is pursuing as Mike is running, why would you 
10 say, do you have any suspicion? 
11 A I saw no reason possible for him to 
12 actually fire the weapon now. If he would just pull 
13 it out to threaten him to stop running, I could see 
14 him doing that, but I still didn't understand why he 
15 pulled a gun out to threaten somebody to stop him, 
16 but like I said, I didn't see no reason for him to 
17 fire the shots. The first one or the rest of the 
18 ones afterwards. 
19 Thank you. 
20 So you 
21 mentioned that he never said stop or halt when Big 
22 Mike was running? 
23 A Correct, yes, sir. 
24 So I guess the point where 
25 he fired the one shot and he turned around?

2 Leading up to that, you 
3 never heard stop, get on the ground? 
4 A No, sir and like I said, I was still on 
5 the scene to the point where I could, I was still 
6 right in the area and the only thing that I heard 
7 was Big Mike tell me to keep running. After that 
8 there was no more words said by anybody, it was just 
9 shots fired. 
10 I have a 
11 question. You said after the first shot, your ears 
12 were ringing? 
13 
14 
A Yes. 
I've been in close range 
15 with a loud noise, I know it can take a while for 
16 your hearing to fully restore where it is like 
17 cotton or ear plugs, how well did you actually hear 
18 Michael Brown say, keep running, Bro, or was it 
19 really muffled to you. I guess where I'm going with 
20 this, if you really couldn't hear that well, were 
21 you able to hear the officer clearly if he was 
22 saying anything? 
23 A Right, and I understand that. Prior to 
24 the first shot firing off and I got to the car, I 
25 guess the ring, like I said, I've been shot at

1 before, I've been shot once before, but I've been 
2 shot at in crazy situations, walking home from 
3 school and all. 
4 So the ringing affect from gunfire, 
5 it really didn't drown out everything because my 
6 adrenaline was pumping so hard, my mind is going so 
7 many different ways, like survival mode I should 
8 say. So once he says something, I can definitely 
9 hear, I'm like I'm locked in on him and the police 
10 officer, Big Mike and the police officer. 
11 So once he runs by me and says, keep 
12 running, Bro, it is almost clear as us having a 
13 conversation. 
14 As the police officer is walking by, 
15 he's not saying anything so much as focusing on 
16 where he's going because he never once glanced over 
17 at me like Big Mike did. Big Mike actually turned 
18 his head and looked at me and kept running. The 
19 officer walked past me and now that I'm not, I'm not 
20 crouched down lower than I was when Big Mike saw me, 
21 I'm still, is the officer going to see me or what is 
22 he going to do because I know he can see me. What 
23 is he going to say. He never said anything, never 
24 look towards me, he just kept walking past me.

1 the scene to verify that what you thought happened 
2 did indeed happen, what did you do then when you see 
3 him laying, and there is no police there, what do 
4 you do? 
5 A At that time I kind of stood back into the 
6 crowd of people that is starting to come out now 
7 because at that time now, police officer was coming. 
8 At that time it wasn't Darren Wilson who came back, 
9 it was some other officer. 
10 He initially started putting up the 
11 tape around the area. At that time it was, he was 
12 by hisself. 
13 So the family and people, I could 
14 tell it was his family. They were trying to get 
15 information from that officer who had just got on 
16 the scene, so he really didn't know anything that 
17 happened. So he's basically telling them to get 
18 back, get back, move away and move away. I'm just 
19 standing there like if this is his family and all 
20 they want to know is why their son is laying in the 
21 street uncovered. He wasn't covered at that time. 
22 Everyone is taking pictures of him 
23 and stuff like that, he's not covered, he's bleeding 
24 everything, he's out in the open. The parents want 
25 to know why, they're asking this officer who is on

1 the scene caution up, he's not telling them 
2 anything, he has no information. Darren Wilson 
3 wasn't there to tell him anything, you know, he was 
4 gone. 
5 His car was still there, they 
6 actually had to take some caution tape over his car 
7 because they left it there at that time so his car 
8 was still there. It was cautioned off, but when I 
9 saw that they were not giving, you know, the parents 
10 what happened or anything like that and I was kind 
11 of waiting to see if they were, if anybody were 
12 going to come out to speak to them and say anything, 
13 no one said anything. 
14 Q Did you make contact with the police to 
15 let them know what was going on? 
16 A At that time I was real fearful, I was 
17 more scared of police. I should say I didn't want 
18 them to know when I ran the first time, everyone was 
19 saying well, there was somebody with him, he ran so 
20 fast we couldn't tell who it was, that's how fast I 
21 was running. Even people who see me every day in my 
22 complex didn't know it was me running. 
23 Q Who was the first person that you talked 
24 to about what happened? 
25 A I had, I went to his grandmother's house.

They actually wanted me to walk down, that 
4 was my first interview. I don't know if it was Fox 
5 2 or anything like that, the first statement that 
6 I've given. And that was the reason I gave it 
7 because the family they asked me if I could do it 
8 for them because they wanted to get it out 
9 immediately. Their words, so it wouldn't be covered 
10 up or misconstrued or any type of way. They wanted 
11 me to get it out there quickly. 
12 Even at that time now, it's a lot, 
13 there is a strong police for now, there is a lot of 
14 police officers, detectives out there. While I'm 
15 talking to the camera, I'm talking to the camera 
16 crew right here in this area where the cameras are 
17 located at. 
18 They taped off pretty much this area. 
19 They taped off so all of that was taped off, nobody 
20 could come through here or there or anybody like 
21 that, it was taped off. Police force strong right 
22 here and they are walking around, but I'm right here

Q 
A 
Q 
You talking about that particular day? 
Yeah, that day. 
So you didn't talk to the police, you were 
6 so fearful? 
7 A I was so afraid. I didn't know what was 
8 going to happen to me. I basically just didn't, 
9 really I didn't feel comfortable with Ferguson at 
10 the time. That was really who was out there at that 
11 time, there was a lot of Ferguson police officers 
12 and I just felt like, you know what, I don't need to 
13 be seen right now. I don't want to be detained in 
14 any type of way, you know. It was just a lot at the 
15 time and I was just in the crowd. 
16 Even so, no one was asking for me or 
17 looking for me really, they was just trying to 
18 patrol the area what was going on. 
19 Q Did you learn a day or two afterwards that 
20 the police were wanting to get your statement? 
21 A I didn't, a couple, three or four days, it 
22 wasn't until I had my lawyer, that really was what 
23 my concern was, I wait until I got a lawyer so that 
24 I can, if they were looking for me, they wanted me. 
25 I can go to my lawyer, here is what happen. I have

2 like that. 
3 At the time I didn't have nobody 
4 representing me, I didn't have no one even caring if 
5 it was me there or not.

7 that the police came to

Q looking for you to get a statement? 9 
10 A I was actually there. No one came, I was 
11 there in my apartment that day, no one came, knocked 
12 on the door. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
Not on the 11th, nobody came? 
Probably so because I don't know if I was 
15 going to stay there on the 11th. When I came out, 
16 the next day after this on the lOth, people thought 
17 I was dead. Because they said that they found a 
18 body, that is what happened, they found a body

When I came out of my apartment,

25 dead. They said they found some body behind the

4 just me, for my daughter and my girlfriend. 
5 Q Did your girlfriend tell you that the 
6 police were looking for you to get a statement? 
7 A She didn't see the police.

A 
Q

Not with her or me. 
So when did you first talk to the police? 
The first police that I did talk to was 
13 the FBI and St. Louis County, and that was four days 
14 prior to them releasing the video, so four days 
15 before that, I had my talk with the FBI.

17 probably?

So that would have been the 13th of August 
Yeah, the 13th. 
Okay. And so, even though the county 
20 police, you know, the county police had taken over 
21 the investigation? 
22 A Well, I was out there long enough to see 
23 the county actually come in and Ferguson leave, I 
24 saw all of that.

1 to get you to get a statement, but you just weren't 
2 aware of that? 
3 A At the time, no, I wasn't aware of that, 
4 that the county was looking for me or they wanted me 
5 for questioning or anything like that. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask a question? 
7 Dorian, I know you talked about when you, you were 
8 right by the police vehicle and you see these three 
9 cars come up? 
10 
11 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Did you notice were any 
12 cars coming from that direction? 
13 A At that time, actually, through the 
14 incident, no cars were coming in that direction. 
15 There was no one trying to get over even though I 
16 could see the police squad car is on the opposite 
17 side of the line as well, but no one came. There 
18 was no one held up that way. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: When you ran after the 
20 police officer shot Mike and you ran away, you ran 
21 kind of around, did you run around the police car, 
22 is that the line you drew? 
23 A That the tape, that's me here and that's 
24 run all the way around.

Oh, no.

MS. ALIZADEH: You didn't say they killed 
It did come out, but I didn't get it out 
8 loud where someone would have heard it, I was just, 
9 killed my friend. You know, I was still 
10 hyperventilating, but it didn't come out a clear 
11 sentence to where somebody standing there would have 
12 heard it. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: You didn't see whether 
14 there were any cars right there that would have seen 
15 any of this? 
16 
17 
A Oh definitely, the three cars. 
MS. ALIZADEH: No, no, no, I'm sorry, on 
18 the other side of the police car? 
19 A No, when I was running, I wasn't looking, 
20 I looked at the officer, I seen that he was still 
21 standing there, and that's when trying to figure out 
22 something in his head, let me run and I just ran. I 
23 just kept running.

1 question for you. You talked about Michael Brown 
2 said something, exchange words with the officer 
3 during the tug of war at the car, you heard him say 
4 something. And you heard him say something towards 
5 the end right before he was killed, you didn't hear 
6 the officer say anything during that tug of war or 
7 anything during that entire time that he was coming 
8 down the street. 
9 A I didn't hear him, no, when he was coming 
10 down the street after he got out of the car he said 
11 nothing, I didn't see his mouth move. I was there 
12 looking at him, his mouth wasn't moving, he didn't 
13 say freeze or anything like that before he fired the 
14 second shot, which made him stop. 
15 And the car, because of the, I'm not 
16 used to seeing, I see police officers get into it 
17 with people before, I'm not use in that manner 
18 sitting in his car, tug of war and all of that, I'm 
19 not used to seeing it like that. 
20 I'm not focused so much on what they 
21 said, so much as saying who was going to calm down, 
22 who was going to give in to the words because that 
23 is all it was at the car was just words. There was 
24 no physical altercation really as much as the 
25 pulling of the arm, but so much as words being said

1 in a very aggressive manner. 
2 Nothing like, no threatening manner 
3 like I'll kill you, or let me go or I'll punch you. 
4 Let me the F go, get the F off of me, and what the 
5 officer said, I couldn't really make what he was 
6 saying, I heard him cussing also, he had a very 
7 angry face. 
8 Once he exited the car, 
9 you didn't hear the officer say anything? 
10 A Once he got out of the car after the shot 
11 was fired, he didn't instantly get out of the car 
12 when we ran, it took him like a minute maybe, or 
13 some seconds to get out of the car, that's how I was 
14 able to get to where I was able to position myself. 
15 I didn't hear the door open until 
16 after Big Mike was passing me telling me to keep 
17 running. I hear the door and now, I didn't look 
18 back at the time, so I'm not really sure if it was 
19 his door or the people's door whose car I'm hiding 
20 behind, but I hear a door open and slam. And almost 
21 seconds later, I see the officer walking past me, so 
22 I kind of figure he was getting out of his car at 
23 that time. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Dorian, you said it took 
25 almost a minute for him to get out of the car?

It is almost like it was a pause before he 
5 got out of the car. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Now, you said 
7 earlier that he never radioed for help, is it 
8 possible while he was in the car, that's what he was 
9 doing? 
10 A It is possible that little split second of 
11 him not instantly getting out of the car he was 
12 radioing for backup.

17 between the time that you started, your day with Big

19 shooting, 12-ish or so, you guys never did get a 
20 chance to smoke the weed? 
21 A We never got a chance to do anything. We 
22 never got a chance to make it back to the house. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Were you two ever apart 
24 during that day, like where he could have been doing 
25 something that you weren't there to witness?

1 A Yeah, those hours before I woke up and saw

3 MS. ALIZADEH: I mean, from the time you 
4 saw him in the morning? 
5 A From the time I saw him, we was together 
6 from seven all the way to him dying. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
8 You 
9 said several times that the police officer didn't 
10 say stop or freeze or halt or whatever, but he did 
11 say twice I'll shoot, I'll shoot you. 
12 A He said it fully once. The second time he 
13 didn't really get it out before the shot. It was 
14 almost like --
15 The first time he said 
16 I'll shoot, his gun went off and the second time the 
17 officer pulled his weapon out and said the second 
18 time I'll shoot you. What did you think that meant, 
19 did you not think that meant to stop? 
20 A When someone says I'll shoot? 
21 I'll shoot you, when a 
22 cop says, police officer. 
23 A When a police officer says I'll shoot, 
24 that doesn't mean stop or halt.

1 A That means get out of the way, either get

3 if he really wanted to stop. They have a lot of

6 I'm sure like you go through some 
7 type of simulation to where any, you know, any

11 handle a situation as opposed to just pulling his

13 who don't have weapons drawn down on him. 
14 I'm not saying anything at all, he's 
15 not, he's yelling, but he's not making any 
16 threatening remarks towards the officer, so there 
17 was no need for him to draw his gun in the first 
18 manner, and that's what it really became. Oh, let

20 hand either furthermore the argument. And that was 
21 in itself and I see that you could of, I'm not going
