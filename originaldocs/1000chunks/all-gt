8 
9 
A 
Q 
No, I did not. 
There's, obviously, at some point in the 
10 investigation there is some information that is 
11 learned that Michael Brown was involved in a 
12 stealing that took place on the same day prior to 
13 the shooting up at the Ferguson Market, correct? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q When did you first learn that, about 
16 Michael Brown being involved in a stealing or I 
17 think you have termed it a strong armed robbery but 
18 the incident at the Ferguson Market, when did you 
19 learn about that? 
20 A I think it was later in that day that 
21 somebody on the scene said this may be the same two 
22 individuals that were involved in the incident at 
23 9101. 
24 Q Did you ever ask Officer Wilson or did 
25 anybody ever tell you that Officer Wilson told them

1 about what he knew or didn't know when he first 
2 encountered the two subjects, who we now know are 
3 Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson, on Canfield? 
4 A I don't have any direct knowledge of what 
5 he knew or suspected at the time. 
6 Q Now, prior to you coming in the grand jury 
7 this afternoon, I played a couple of your press 
8 conferences for you; is that right? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, you did. 
And you talk in your press conference that 
11 Officer Wilson, the reason for his stop was not 
12 because of those two being involved in the stealing 
13 at the Ferguson Market. Why, can you explain the 
14 comments you made during your interview? 
15 A Sure. I was simply restating what was 
16 told to me at the time that the initial contact was 
17 related to two individuals walking in the street and 
18 him instructing them to get out of the street. 
19 Q Okay. And so, and that came to you not 
20 from Darren Wilson, but from other person correct?

1 said someone else told you that the initial contact 
2 with Michael Brown had to do with them walking in 
3 the street? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: Do you know who told you 
6 that? 
7 A Sergeant 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Sergeant I didn't 
9 hear that part, okay. But so when you got on 
10 television, you basically said that that was not the 
11 reason, the stealing at the market was not the 
12 reason for the initial contact? 
13 A The initial contact. That's the 
14 information that was relayed to me.

16 contact, what are you referring to?

2 personal relationship with Officer Wilson? I know 
3 you spoke very highly of him. 
4 A Not a personal relationship, just 
5 professional. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Just one of your officers? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: But nothing, you don't 
9 socialize with him outside of work or anything like

14 day. 
15

A Yes, ma'am. 1 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) You are familiar with 
3 that, of course. Is that something the officers are 
4 taught about or have training on how did to use that 
5 button and when to use that button? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. They actually test them on 
7 occasion. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Is this the kind of incident 
9 that you would have imagined or expected for an 
10 officer to use the button? 
11 A I would expect any time there is a 
12 physical confrontation that would be a useful tool, 
13 yes. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: And if, you know, shots are 
15 fired, certainly you would expect someone to use 
16 that button. 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: That's all I have right now. 
19 Anybody else? 
20 Follow-up on 
21 that question. You have a lot of experience,

1 Something like his 
2 obviously happened very quickly, would it be unusual 
3 not to have that button pushed? I mean, are 
4 surprised it's not or in your experience it may not? 
5 A I don't know whether it was pushed or not, 
6 I don't. 
7 If it was not, would you 
8 be surprised necessarily? 
9 A No, not necessarily. 
10 Okay. 
11 Officer 
12 Wilson when he testified before indicated to us that 
13 he did not carry a taser. And his reason for such 
14 is that it was uncomfortable to carry. I mean, is 
15 it standard procedure for an officer to dictate what 
16 he will and will not carry. 
17 A Urn, under the circumstances tasers, I 
18 didn't know that he didn't carry the taser until 
19 after the incident that day. We have a limited 
20 number of tasers. 
21 When I actually got to the Ferguson 
22 Police Department, there were a lot deficiencies 
23 that I wanted to correct, and one of them was there 
24 were too many incidents where a taser could have 
25 been used, but we didn't have them.

1 So I set about trying to locate some 
2 money and just buy a few at a time. We don't have a 
3 taser assigned to each officer, but we're trying to 
4 improve that. 
5 Okay. Just in addition to 
6 that, how long has this been known you don't have 
7 enough tasers for every officer, I mean, when did 
8 you discover the problem? 
9 A They didn't have enough? 
10 About the lack of amount 
11 of tasers. 
12 A There were no tasers when I started 
13 working there at all. 
14 Okay. 
15 A I bought five with some grant money that I 
16 was able to dig up and with some asset sharing. And 
17 then as I got another grant, I bought a few more. 
18 Uh-huh. 
19 A I'm trying to get enough so that each 
20 officer will have his own personal. 
21 When you get this grant, 
22 is it a grant, urn, that is specifically set out for 
23 those tasers? Like when you feel that you need some 
24 tasers or whatever, do you initiate this grant, I 
25 want X amount of money, I need five more tasers.

1 A It is more, that's pretty much the case, 
2 ma'am. We get notified or we search for grants that 
3 are available. 
4 Uh-huh. 
5 A In this case I think this was through the 
6 State Cops Program that there would be an 
7 application process for grants. So you have the 
8 opportunity to say, I have this need, then you have 
9 to have explain the need and justify it and then say 
10 how much money you would like to have. 
11 And then they decide how much money 
12 they are going to give you, if any. 
13 When you receive the 
14 money, you put in, say you put in for the tasers, 
15 okay. You get the grant money delivered to you or 
16 whatever. And say there is something else that 
17 comes up that you feel now is more warranted. Do 
18 you specifically have to use that grant money? 
19 
20 
21 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Okay, all right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I want to clarify whether 
22 or not they needed more tasers in the Ferguson 
23 Police Department or should have is certainly 
24 something that needs to be addressed at this point, 
25 but for this incident, Chief, you're aware that,

1 you're now aware that Officer Wilson did not have a 
2 taster on his person; is that right. 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Were officers required 
5 to carry a taster at that time? 
6 A No. 
7 Q So was it up to the individual officers to 
8 decide whether he was going to carry a taser? 
9 A Pretty much, yes. This is a less lethal 
10 may be used and precisely we didn't have enough for 
11 everybody. 
12 Q Is it possible that there could be more 
13 officers working a shift than there would be tasers 
14 available for that shift? In other words, maybe six 
15 officers working and maybe at the time you only have 
16 five tasers that were actually working at the time? 
17 A That is possible. I don't know if that 
18 was the case here. 
19 Q But regardless, we know now he didn't have 
20 a taser with him?

1 your protocol when it comes for one of your police 
2 officers, maybe another scene just happened on 
3 August the 9th, do you, was it your own authority or 
4 opinion not to speak to him about what happened at 
5 the scene or was you instructed? 
6 A No, ma'am, it was my decision to turn the 
7 entire investigation over to St. Louis County Police 
8 Department and to separate myself, my detectives 
9 from that. I just believe 35 years in law 
10 enforcement we not only have to be impartial and 
11 fair, but there also has to be no appearance of 
12 impropriety. 
13 It just seems like an agency, I came 
14 from a very big police department, moved to a very 
15 small police department. Small, much smaller police 
16 department and it just seems that the department 
17 that size needs to move something this critical like 
18 a fatal officer shooting to a larger law enforcement 
19 agency or particularly a different law enforcement 
20 agency to handle. 
21 Also I don't believe that 
22 Officer Wilson had mace either, did you know that? 
23 A I did not know that. 
24 Are they checked 
25 regularly, whatever they have on their gear, do they

1 have like a captain like protocol command so someone 
2 checking their uniforms before they leave the 
3 department. 
4 A Yes, ma'am, we have roll call and the 
5 supervisor is responsible for making sure of those 
6 things. 
7 I'm going to 
8 go back to what nine has. Is mace required because 
9 I thought he said he had mace but didn't spray it 
10 because it was too close in the vehicle for it not 
11 to affect him. 
12 If I could say something, 
13 I believed the reaction that he 
14 gets from it would cause more problem or cause him 
15 to be more debilitated. 
16 That was my question. 
17 Did you recall the he had it or did not? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: At this point rather than 
19 discussing the witness' testimony, I have provided 
20 you all the transcript previously because there was 
21 a question about another point of another witness' 
22 testimony. So if you want to ask this witness 
23 questions about what his knowledge or information 
24 was or the policies or protocols, I'm not cutting 
25 you off from asking that question, but talking about

1 what other people might have said, probably better 
2 to go back and refer to the transcript. 
3 Mace is not required? 
4 A Mace is issued to each officer so they 
5 are, issued equipment is expected to be carried but 
6 it is going to be largely to the officers discretion 
7 which item to use. For example, I would not be in 
8 very close quarters use pepper mace. 
9 But you would expect your 
10 officer to have it on him? 
A I would expect. 11 
12 
13 
When he's on patrol? 
A Yes. 
14 So in 
15 your career in law enforcement have you ever been 
16 dealt with or been involved in any way in other 
17 officer involved shooting? 
18 A Yes. 
19 So my kind of question 
20 onto that is, in other words, there was talk about 
21 how the officer left the scene in this incident. He 
22 left by himself in Sergeant vehicle, went 
23 back to the station to wash his hands, is that some 
24 typical protocol? Should he have been escorted? I 
25 don't know, I'd just like to know.

A That's news to me too, but I would of had 
someone else take him to the station. I certainly 
3 had someone else take him to the hospital. 
4 If you could, maybe, in 
5 your role in your experience before working at 
6 Ferguson, what was the relationship with the 
7 community, the police department in the community. 
8 A In my four years there excellent. We have 
9 nine community associations, neighborhood 
10 associations in Ferguson. And I'm very well 
11 acquainted with all the members of those. Go to a 
12 lot of their meetings. I send my officers there to 
13 give them crime updates every month at their 
14 meetings. 
15 I attend all the events, I sing the 
16 national anthem for them at the 4th of July and the 
17 beginning of the 5K run that we have every year. It 
18 is a very active, involved community. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: What about Canfield Green, 
20 the folks that live in the Canfield Green 
21 Apartments, are they involved in these associations 
22 and active with the police? 
23 A We were trying very hard to get 
24 associations over there and neighborhood watches 
25 over there. We went over, it is a big complex as

1 you probably know. Canfield Green runs into the 
2 Northwinds Estates, runs into Oakmont, they are all, 
3 it is a very dense community. So we were trying to 
4 get neighborhood watch in there. 
5 So we do things such as we have 
6 resource displays where we bring the dogs, 
7 firetrucks and the officers over there and everyone, 
8 every resident gets a copy of the Ferguson Times 
9 that says all the events are happening, things like 
10 that. 
11 It has been difficult to get a 
12 neighborhood association going over in there. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Why do you think that is? 
14 A Probably a lot of it has to do with the 
15 transient population. People don't plan on living 
16 there for long periods of time, so they don't get 
17 deeply involved in the community. 
18 But we also did several things with 
19 all of those apartments, you know, try to improve 
20 quality of life and reduce crime in those areas. We 
21 were very involved in there. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: How many officers do you 
23 have, I don't know if you said that already.

A Yes, ma'am. 1 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: Were you concerned or did 
3 you have any thoughts about the information that we 
4 now know and you may know, I don't know, that as you 
5 said the initial contact with Michael Brown was when 
6 Officer Wilson told them to get out of the middle of 
7 the street and then he backed up, I guess at this 
8 point he may have known about this stealing at the 
9 Ferguson Market, he backs up, and, you know, he's 
10 confronting Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson from 
11 his car. Is that something that's pretty much 
12 standard is to sit in your car and investigate a 
13 potential robbery or stealing. 
14 A No, it is my understanding is that he was 
15 trying to get out of his car. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
17 A But again, this is, you know, second, 
18 third hand information. I have not asked for any of 
19 the evidence.

21 think that he would get out of the car if he was 
22 going to do any investigation?

1 appropriate, I guess, if you notice these two 
2 suspects and you put your car in reverse, would it 
3 be, I guess, okay to put your sirens on or not even 
4 your sirens, your flashing lights and turn your 
5 lights on to let, I guess, the community know 
6 something is going on here? 
7 A Not necessarily. I don't think that would 
8 be either a bad or good thing, it is neutral. 
9 Even with traffic kind of 
10 coming both ways there? 
11 A If it is going to be blocking traffic in 
12 the street, yeah, that would probably be 
13 appropriate, yes, sir. 
14 In regards to field 
15 training, I have a question continuing on the 
16 previous comment, when he pulled back in reverse, 
17 from Officer Wilson's perspective and others, he 
18 says himself he impeded their traffic, he backed his 
19 car up to prevent them from going anywhere. Is that 
20 also, is that protocol, is that something you would 
21 expect an officer to do, kind of use the vehicle to 
22 in that manner? 
23 A To use the vehicle? 
24 When he backed up, put it 
25 in reverse as we now understand, he kind of thought

2 the car up to impede the way they were walking. It 
3 was in there way essentially.

8 had experience with police officer involved

11 Is this the first time 
12 you had any experience with a police officer 
13 involved shooting in Ferguson? 
14 A Uh, fatal shooting, yes. 
15 You said you didn't 
16 realize how things were handled after he went back 
17 to the station by himself, he washed his hands and 
18 everything, and so I was just wondering if, and you 
19 said you didn't know that, but is that not the way 
20 you would, you would have expected that to be 
21 handled? 
22 A Right, but in this particular case, I 
23 separated myself from all of this. I'm going to 
24 have to do my own investigation, internal affairs, 
25 when this is over.

I've got one more 
question. In one of your press conferences, 
3 , you state that evidence was found on 
4 Michael Brown from the robbery. 
5 
6 
A Yeah, I saw that too. I'm not sure I 
understood the question. I didn't have any 
7 knowledge of that one way or another, particularly 
8 then. 
9 When 
10 you were in the academy, what was your training on 
11 deadly force, when to use it and how much to use it 
12 if you are confronted with an adversary and had to 
13 fire your weapon? 
14 A We're going back to the police academy, 
15 that's quite a ways essentially. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask something else 
17 along the same lines. Does your office, or does 
18 your department train your officers on when they can 
19 use force to affect an arrest and when they can use 
20 deadly force? 
21 
22 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Other than what they learn 
23 at the police academy, anything that your department 
24 instructs them about? 
25 A

1 education. The post-training they are required 
2 where it includes firearms training, deadly force 
3 training every year. A lot of it is dictated by 
4 both state and federal law and Supreme Court 
5 decisions that sometimes change circumstances and 
6 deadly force. Fleeing felon rule, for example. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So let me ask, I know 
8 and maybe this hasn't been testified about, but 
9 officers have to get continuing education to 
10 maintain their certification every year; is that 
11 right? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So every year officers have to have so 
14 many hours of continuing education, correct? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And that's put on by various organizations 
17 and entities, would that be fair to say? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so there might be other entities that 
20 would give additional instruction or training on use 
21 of force to affect an arrest and the use of deadly 
22 force, but my question is, does your department 
23 itself train or instruct the officer, or is there 
24 any kind of formalized training in your department, 
25 put on by your department about use of force?

A 
Q 
Page 211 
Yes, ma'am. 
And is that done as like in the form of 
3 giving them some written materials, or is that done 
4 as in some kind of class setting? 
5 A We have our own firearms range, it is an 
6 inside range. All of our firearms training is done 
7 in-house. So it is done annually. 
8 Q Do you have a particular officer who then 
9 does the instruction on using force during an arrest 
10 to affect an arrest or the use of deadly force? 
11 A That's through the continuing education. 
12 That would be through the police academy or North 
13 County Chiefs Association Training, or outside 
14 training, that's all part of continuing education. 
15 Q And so the firearms training you're 
16 talking about, that's in relation to them being able 
17 to handle a weapon and how to shoot the weapon and 
18 store the weapon and so forth, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So does your department have any written 
21 literature that talks about use of force to affect 
22 an arrest and the use of deadly force? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. We have general orders. 
So your department has general orders? 
Yes, ma'am.

1 Q Is it a requirement of all of your 
2 officers to study those general orders and to know 
3 those general orders? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And those general orders are written by 
6 who? 
7 A Urn, when I got there four and a half years 
8 ago, I was not satisfied with the policy manual so I 
9 set out to mirror, to get a complete general orders 
10 manual policies and procedures for an agency our 
11 size that mirrored CALEA. 
Q What's CALEA? 12 
13 A The Commission For Accreditation of Law 
14 Enforcement Agencies, it is international. It is 
15 very expensive to get that done. So I started with 
16 the State of Missouri certification process, which 
17 takes several years. 
18 We developed a complete general 
19 orders manual, so as those general orders came out, 
20 the officers were required to and often times we 
21 would have supervisors or officers present training, 
22 train each other on those general orders. 
23 Q Okay. So you have a specific general 
24 order regarding the use of force to effect an arrest 
25 and the use of deadly force during an arrest?

Could we get a copy of that general orders

A 
Q 
Yes. 
If the grand jurors wanted it? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Excuse me, I just want to 
7 ask for the orders. Are there any orders as to what 
8 the protocol would be after a shooting has occurred? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Urn, I'm trying to think. Yes, there are. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And so you said that the 
12 general orders that once you took over you were kind 
13 of revamping them? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q That's my word, revamping. In doing so, 
16 were you trying to make them compliant with the law. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you also said that you were attempting 
19 to have them hear other possible state 
20 organizations' policy and so forth? 
21 A Yes, to create the most professional 
22 organization that I could. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, do you have any 
24 more question?

1 I heard both 
2 of you use the phrase use of weapon to affect an 
3 arrest and use of deadly force. Can you tell me 
4 what the difference between those two are? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: I had said use of force to 
6 affect an arrest and then use of a deadly weapon, 
7 use of deadly force. 
8 Okay. We've heard a lot 
9 about in the media, can you tell me the difference 
10 between those two? 
A Between use of force? 11 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Use of force to affect an 
13 arrest and use of deadly force. 
14 A Okay. Force actually in the force 
15 continuum which is taught in the academy starts with 
16 the presence of the uniform. 
17 Okay. 
18 A Then it goes to hands on, maybe just 
19 compliance holds, and then it can go to fighting. 
20 Then you have less lethal option such as the taser, 
21 bean bang rounds, pepper mace, there's also stick 
22 batons, those are all not considered, for example, 
23 the baton and the taser are considered less lethal. 
24 There's a possibility that they could be, but it is 
25 considered less lethal weapon.

1 And then finally when you get to 
2 deadly force, that would be a firearm in the 
3 continuum. 
4 Tell me, are the officers 
5 taught where to shoot specifically if they have to 
6 get to that point? 
7 A Yes, ma'am.

A Yes, ma'am. 
A Yes, ma'am. 
And it is never in the

So that's their training? 
In your 
17 policies or procedures, is there anything ever 
18 addressed or have you seen it addressed in your four 
19 years there when you are affecting or potentially 
20 trying to detain somebody or affect an arrest, is it 
21 ever mentioned trying to grab somebody out a car 
22 window to detain them? 
23 A 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, no. 
Have you ever heard that? 
No. Generally the force necessary to

1 affect the arrest is what the standard is. 
2 Okay. But not 
3 specifically, whatever you do, wherever you are 
4 potentially to reach out a car window and detain 
5 somebody? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Chief would you 
8 expect one of your officers to attempt to arrest a 
9 suspect simply because they were walking in the 
10 middle of the street? 
11 A Arrest, no. I would expect that they 
12 would ask them to move to the sidewalk. And then if 
13 they refused, they can be issued a summons for that. 
14 Much like a traffic ticket. 
15 Race is not 
16 mentioned today in our conversation, but I would 
17 like to know what the officer thought or assume as a 
18 white officer and a black suspect? 
19 A Can I ask you, my years of flying a 
20 helicopter, that ear is not 
21 Race has been a huge 
22 factor, what the officer assumed or thought of the 
23 suspect before he saw him. So my question to you 
24 is, one, do you feel like your department racially, 
25 the kind of racial diversity, does that reflect the

1 Ferguson community or not? 
2 A I think that I've made an effort since I 
3 got there to increase racial diversity because of 
4 the make up of the community. It is very difficult 
5 with an agency my size. 
6 I did, probably heard me say this, 
7 when I got there, there had never been an 
8 African-American supervisor on the police 
9 department. I promoted the first two in the 
10 history, I'm very proud of that. And I've tried 
11 hard to recruit minority candidates, but again, St. 
12 Louis County, there's St. Louis City, there's 
13 Missouri State Highway Patrol, there is federal 
14 agencies, you know, it is difficult to recruit and 
15 retain. 
16 So knowing that and 
17 knowing that's an area for growth. 
18 A Yes. 
19 Would you say with your 
20 department, is there any steps in place or any 
21 action taken to help educate on social diversity or 
22 how to interact with those maybe, whether it is 
23 beliefs or whatever that may be, anything you do 
24 department wide.

1 officers receive that type of training as part of 
2 their recertification every three years. So there 
3 is annual racial profiling or diversity training 
4 which is required. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: And there's a lot of other 
6 training that's out there. 
7 Recently we, of course, we doubled our 
8 efforts. Some of my commanders just attended a 
9 really good bias policing training put on by the 
10 Cops Program. I have met with the National Director 
11 from Cops and we talked a lot about some of the new 
12 and young and exciting training in adversity that's 
13 out there, but this training actually had citizens 
14 and police officers in the training. It was a real 
15 good environment. 
16 Okay. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody else have any 
18 questions regarding this witness and his knowledge 
19 about the incident, his press conferences in 
20 particular? Okay.

4 Kathi is passing out the transcripts for that. 
5 After we played that, we're going to play 
6 a statement by an interview with
