13 far was the way it was on August 9th? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And so if an officer hits that alert tone, 
16 we have already heard what happens then, but the 
17 dispatcher is able to tell at least whether it is a 
18 mobile radio or a portable radio? 
A Yes, ma'am. 19 
20 Q And then the dispatcher would know by the 
21 radio number whose portable it was? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And they also know if it is a mobile 
24 radio, what car it's in? 
25 A Right.

Page 17 
All right. And so the radio that you 
2 brought with you, you said is Darren Wilson's radio, 
3 correct? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And you took the back off of it to show me 
6 something earlier today? 
7 A Yes, it is the radio. Each radio comes 
8 with a number, either their DSN is on there or their 
9 name is the put on the radio itself. And it 
10 coincides with the inventory list that is made up 
11 when the radio is passed out. 
12 Q And so you just took the back off of that 
13 portable radio and what's written on the inside of 
14 it? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
17 his DSN? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
D. Wilson, radio 99. 
And so is 99 the radio number or is that 
That is the radio number. 
Okay. And so if ever, I mean, all the 
20 radios look alike. If ever two radios would get 
21 mixed up, you would be able to open that up, anybody 
22 could open it up and see whose it is? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. We can also look at the 
24 serial number also on there and determine whose it 
25 is.

(Grand jury Exhibit Number 90 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going to hand you 
4 what I marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 90. You brought 
5 with you today some paperwork about the 
6 communication system and who is assigned to what 
7 radio and so forth; is that right? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
I am going to show you Grand Jury Exhibit 
10 Number 90. It says portable radio inventory. Did 
11 you print that off and bring it with you this 
12 morning? 
13 A Yes, I did. 
14 Q What does this show? 
15 A This is telling me who has the radio, 
16 model number of the radio, the number of the radio 
17 and also the serial number of the radio. 
18 It also tells me if it has a mike 
19 attached to it. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Whose the patrol detectives, or the jail, 
22 who has the radio. 
23 Q Okay. So now in the column that says 
24 assignment vehicle, personnel, spare, cash, et 
25 cetera, it has officer's DSN as opposed to their

4 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What 
609. 
So on 
is Officer Wilson's DSN? 
this record then we can see that DSN 5 
6 609 has radio HT750 and then in the corner it says 
7 9 9, who wrote that? 
A I wrote that. 8 
9 
10 
Q Did you write that prior to coming today? 
A No, a lot of these when we were doing 
11 inventories, either the officer was off that day or 
12 they were on vacation. And I, as you can see there, 
13 is like unknown what their numbers are. 
14 So when they come back on duty, then 
15 I can get with them and find out what their number 
16 is and I will write it in. 
17 Q Okay. I'm going to pass copies of this 
18 around to everybody. 
19 And so not only can you tell that 
20 that's Officer Wilson's radio by looking in the 
21 back, but also you can double check with the 
22 inventory that you have to make sure that the serial 
23 number on that radio is the same as the radio 
24 assigned to him, correct?

1 Q Okay. And so again, when a radio, when 
2 somebody on a portable radio calls in to dispatch, 
3 is there anything on a screen that tells that 
4 dispatcher who it is? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And so how is it that officers then will 
7 typically identify themselves when they are calling 
8 in? 
9 A They have sectors. And that's determined 
10 when they come in in the morning and they are doing 
11 the roll call, the supervisor will give them a 
12 sector. That sector number, which will be like 
13 maybe F22, F23, that's their sector number, that's 
14 their call sign for dispatch. 
15 Q Is that permanently their sector number or 
16 does it change on a regular basis? 
17 A It changes on a regular basis. They do 
18 what they call a rotation of sector. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. So is a sector a geographic area? 
Yes, it is. 
How many sectors are there in Ferguson? 
There's four. 
So at any given time, how many officers 
24 are on assignment in a sector? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
One officer will take care of their

1 sector. And then usually if the squad has a full 
2 amount of officers, they will have what they call 
3 cover cars. Those cover cars will assist the 
4 sectors on any calls. 
5 So if you have a sector car, say F25 
6 goes out on a call, a sick case and he's tied up on 
7 that sick case, dispatch will know that. She will 
8 send a cover car to take another call in his sector. 
9 Q So each sector has one officer that is 
10 assigned to it for that shift? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then how many cover cars are out on 
13 any given shift? 
14 A It can range from maybe one to three, and 
15 I've even seen four, depending on how many people 
16 are working that day. 
17 Q So the cover car is kind of roaming around 
18 the city and can go anywhere whereas the sector car 
19 is going to stay in their own sector? 
A Yes, ma'am. 20 
21 Q Unless they have to leave their sector for 
22 whatever reason? 
23 A Right. 
24 Q And then on any given shift, there's a 
25 supervisor on duty, correct?

A 
Q 
A 
4 sergeant. 
5 Q 
Page 22 
Yes, there is. 
How many supervisors? 
There is usually two lieutenants and a 
Okay. So the sergeant would be directly 
6 in charge of the officers that are riding around in 
7 their sector and the cover cars? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then is that sergeant generally also 
10 in uniform in a patrol car patrolling the city? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then what's the lieutenant doing? 
He's usually in the station doing 
14 paperwork, doing the reports. When he usually gets 
15 called, caught up with the paperwork he'll come out 
16 on patrol also to assist. 
17 Q So on any given shift there's just one 
18 shift working, so there would be one sergeant and 
19 four sector cars and maybe one to three cover cars? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. 
21 When an 
22 officer, when a sector car is out on duty and he 
23 takes a call.

1 calls in and let you know, I'm in position to take 
2 this matter, this issue, blah, blah, blah. Does the 
3 cover car gets called in to let him know, okay, I 
4 need the cover car to service the area or how it 
5 works? 
6 A I know what you are saying. 
7 Okay. 
8 A Usually it works like this. If I call a 
9 car to a sector and that car is out on a sick case, 
10 the cover car automatically hears that they kind of 
11 move over to that area. 
12 Okay. 
13 A They are not actually told to cover it, 
14 but just in experience, they will move to that area 
15 knowing that something could break out in there so 
16 they have coverage. So it is mainly the officer, it 
17 takes the experience of the officer to hear that and 
18 he'll move over into that area. 
19 The cover car should be 
20 able to hear? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
A 
Oh, yeah. 
Okay. I lost my thought. 
Sometimes you'll hear a supervisor get on 
24 the radio and say Frank 28 centralized. That means 
25 they want him to move in closer to his area to cover

1 it. 
2 Okay. You answered it, 
3 okay, thanks. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So when an officer is on 
5 duty and patrolling, is he by himself in his 
6 vehicle? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And currently you have two officers 
9 patrolling together; is that right? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q And that's because of the unrest that has 
12 happened since August 9th? 
13 Yes, ma'am. 
14 Prior to August 9th you would have one man 
15 
16 Yes, ma'am. 
17 And so if the officers are out on patrol, 
18 people already testify that in the mobile 
19 can have like one channel tuned in and you 
20 can have a different channel tuned in on your 
21 portable. Are the officers to be monitoring the 
22 dispatch channel at all times? 
23 A They do. You've got to remember the 
24 mobile units have what they call a scan portion in 
25 it and dispatch is put in on a priority button. So

Page 25 
1 even if you are on scan and say RIOT A comes up on 
2 your radio and they're listening to the RIOT 
3 channel. As soon as dispatch hits their key in 
4 dispatch, it will cut them off and put them in 
5 priority. So they're constantly monitoring that 
6 dispatch channel. 
7 Q So the dispatcher at the station, she's on 
8 a transmitter, he or she is on a transmitter. Do 
9 you know how many watts that transmitter is? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No, I don't. 
Can anybody in the city typically hear the 
12 transmission from the dispatcher? 
13 A They can. Sometimes you do miss calls. 
14 Q And so, you know, we talked earlier about 
15 this say, for example, an officer is going to go on 
16 a sick call, we've talked about, that would be 
17 something that is like short of breath or there has 
18 been somebody faint or something, so the officer is 
19 going to go to a residence and they're going to walk 
20 up to the house. So they leave their mobile car, 
21 the mobile radio in their car and now they're on 
22 their walkie-talkie or their portable, right? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And so you've told me that it is not 
25 unusual, or even it might be typical that the

Page 26 
1 officer once he makes contact or goes into the 
2 residence, might even turn down the volume on his 
3 radio and why is that? 
4 A That's to, when an officer goes into a 
5 sick case, we have a lot of elderly folks, they are 
6 hard to hear. An officer will walk up and just turn 
7 the radio down a portion just so they can hear. You 
8 can hear it through the mike, you don't hear it 
9 through the receiver itself, you hear it through the 
10 mike so it is pretty close. Even when it's down you 
11 can hear it. 
12 They want to have all of their 
13 attention on that person or patient and not listen 
14 to a bunch of garble. 
15 Q Okay. So is it also possible that if 
16 you're on your portable radio and say you go into a 
17 building or whatever, that your radio might not 
18 actually receive a call because of you being inside 
19 a building? 
20 A Right. We have a lot of problems in what 
21 we call one sector where Wal-Mart and Sam's. 
22 Because of the metal building, our walkies won't get 
23 out. A lot of time they can hear at dispatch, but 
24 officers can't call out. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And if an officer is on the dispatch

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXI November 13, 2014

1 channel and calls out, if that call is not heard by 
2 dispatch, how does the officer know that? 
3 A Say it again? 
4 Q If the officer calls out on the dispatch 
5 channel. 
6 A Okay. 
7 Q And let's say that the dispatch doesn't 
8 get that call, they don't hear it or they can't make 
9 it out? 
10 
11 
12 that? 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Uh-huh. 
How does the officer, how might you know 
Dispatch would constantly try to get in 
14 contact with the officer. All dispatchers have 
15 their cell phone numbers for officers. They have a 
16 paper in front of them. It is in a book. If they 
17 can't get ahold of an officer, a lot of time, say 
18 they pick up shoplifter at Wal-Mart, they will 
19 attempt to call that officer several times. And if 
20 they can't get him, they realize they are in a metal 
21 building. So they'll right away get either on their 
22 cell phone or they will call Wal-Mart store to get 
23 ahold of them. 
24 Q So if an officer actually calls, makes a 
25 call on his mike.

A Okay. 1 
2 Q And that doesn't get received, there's no 
3 tone or anything that tells him it wasn't received, 
4 correct? 
5 A No, no. 
6 Q And so are there times then when the 
7 officer, so when an officer makes a call into 
8 dispatch and he may or may not use his call signal 
9 for that day, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And so he may call in Frank 21 and then

for an officer to transmit a call from

No. 
And why would that be? 
It could be a lot of circumstances. 
15 could be the terrain, it could be any number of

1 Q Would that also be, again, possibly their 
2 signal is weak or there might be some building in 
3 between that transmitter and the receiver? 
4 A That could be a number of things. That 
5 could be either the signal is weak, could be that 
6 somebody is walking on them, meaning somebody is 
7 trying to call in at the same time they're talking. 
8 Q Okay. And when that happens, is it the 
9 stronger signal that walks on top of the other call? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
12 first? 
13 A 
14 Q 
Yes, it is. 
It doesn't matter who keys their mike up 
No. 
If somebody keys their mike up and starts 
15 talking and the stronger signal keeps their mike up, 
16 the person who is weaker will cut out? 
17 A Correct. Usually that happens when an 
18 officer's in a vehicle with a higher range of power 
19 and it will cut the walkie. 
20 Q Okay. And so the walkies or the portables 
21 being the weaker signal, you would find that that 
22 would be something that would occur most often with 
23 a portable?

1 Q All right. And so is channel three a 
2 receive only channel? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q So an officer whose walkie-talkie is on 
5 channel three, he can hear somebody transmitting on 
6 that channel, but he can't transmit on that channel? 
7 A No, ma'am. 
8 Q How about dispatch, if dispatch is on 
9 channel three, can they transmit on that channel? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, they can. 
Can they also hear what is being received 
12 on that channel? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q And then so we also talked earlier today 
15 about when an officer's radio is on channel three, 
16 and you demonstrated for me if an officer has his 
17 radio tuned to a receive only channel, does he get a 
18 tone on that radio? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, he does. 
And what's the purpose of that? 
Telling that person that you need to get 
22 on a transmission station, you're on a receive only. 
23 Q So does that tone play when you switch to 
24 that channel or does it only play if you key up the 
25 mike?

1 A The only time it plays a tone if you 
2 switch to the channel as if that's just a dead 
3 channel completely. If it isn't, you can switch it 
4 to that channel, but as soon as you key up on it, it 
5 will make the same tone. 
6 Q So like you don't have channel 12 in 
7 Ferguson, correct? 
8 A No, ma'am. 
9 Q So if you switch the radio to channel 12, 
10 you're going to hear a tone? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
As soon as you switch to it. 
That tone comes out of the mike? 
It actually comes out of both the receive 
14 and the mike. 
15 Q So if it is not a dead channel, so it is 
16 like channel three, a receive only channel, you have 
17 to actually key up the mike to hear that tone? 
18 A You actually don't know until you key up. 
19 It is quiet until you try to transmit and then it 
20 will make a loud tone. 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Q 
You did that for me in my office, correct? 
Yes, ma'am. 
We experimented, there is a volume button 
24 on your radio, correct? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 Q And the volume button, obviously, turns 
2 the volume down on the radio, correct? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Does it turn that tone down as well?

Q

silent. 
You get the chirp turning the radio on. 
Okay. 
This is channel three, it is dead, it is 
(indicating) That's what the officer would 
14 hear, that's telling him, hey, get on a different 
15 channel, you are a receive only. A dead channel 
16 would be as soon as you hit that dead channel, it 
17 tones. 
18 Q Okay. Put it on a dead channel for me, 
19 now turn the volume all the way down. Okay. So you 
20 still hear a tone, but it is a lot quieter?
