I'm just sitting out there. 
Just watching? 
Just watching, looking around. 
I had another question. I 
6 guess you know when you looked up and saw Michael 
7 Brown at the police car, something must have made 
8 you want to think it is more than just an innocent, 
9 you know, stop right there. Because you ran in to 
10 get your phone, can you think of why or what made 
11 you think there was something to record? Did you 
12 hear loud voices, did you look at Michael's face, 
13 did you know something was about to happen. 
14 A It was just a gut feeling. Something just 
15 toll me in my mind that you might want to go get 
16 your phone. 
17 So you just saw a few 
18 seconds of that, whatever happened there. And then 
19 it sounds like you just saw the very last few 
20 seconds at the end before Michael Brown was shot to 
21 death?

23 
A Yes, sir. 
Okay. Thank you. 
24 Your cell 
25 phone, what room was your cell phone in?
