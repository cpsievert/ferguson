How did you know he had been shot? 
Because as the officer is shooting, I 
12 assumed that it was, he was being tased because I've 
13 never witnessed anyone being shot. And I asked my 
14 fiancee is that, I'm like, he's being tased, right, 
15 why isn't he falling. That's not tased, that's 
16 gunshot because I've never seen anyone get shot. 
17 Q So are you saying that that conversation 
18 was while this was going on? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
21 was shot? 
22 A 
Right. 
What makes you say that you saw that he 
Because as, as the officer is shooting, 
23 like you see, like I guess like little smoke or 
24 whatever it was that as the bullets was hitting him, 
25 you saw like the little smoke coming from his chest.

1 That's why I assumed he was being tased. Because I 
2 guess looking at movies and seeing people get shot
