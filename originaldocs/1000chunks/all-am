16 A He had nothing else to wear. I didn't 
17 want him traveling in just a hospital gown back to 
18 Florissant Police Department.

20 well as Darren Wilson and others to go back to the

1 A Lieutenant Colonel I believe, 
2 yes. 
3 Q Did you all arrive at the Ferguson Police 
4 Department at around the same time? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q When you got there, what's the first thing 
7 you did? 
A After meeting with Detective Darren 8 
9 Wilson, Lieutenant Colonel we entered 
10 Ferguson Police Department and went to their 
11 detective bureau. 
12 I was told that's where Officer 
13 Wilson or Darren Wilson's department issued firearm 
14 was, his uniform shirt and that's where we were 
15 making arrangements to have clothes brought to him 
16 so I could document the uniform that he was wearing 
17 and also seize those uniform pants from him. 
18 Q And so when you went into the detective 
19 bureau, did you locate the weapon? 
20 A Yes, I inquired of its whereabouts and I 
21 was told that someone had placed Darren Wilson's 
22 department issued side arm in an evidence envelope, 
23 which wasn't sealed. It was on a desk there in the 
24 detective bureau with other detectives from that 
25 department present.

And did you locate that envelope with the

3 A I did. 
4 Q And you said it wasn't sealed, did you 
5 remove the contents of the envelope? 
6 A I did. 
7 Q What was inside the envelope? 
8 A His department issued Sig Saur firearm, 
9 the magazine and one live round, and that's how the 
10 firearm was placed in that envelope. I did not 
11 download that weapon when I inquired about it. I 
12 was told that Darren Wilson had downloaded the 
13 weapon and then probably at the direction of the 
14 supervisor, it was placed in that envelope and 
15 merely for conveyance purposes, I assumed from the 
16 scene back to Ferguson Police Department until I 
17 arrived. 
18 Q 
19 correct? 
20

Q 
Page 31 
Yes. 
And you all know what that means, 
3 downloading, other than like on the internet, can 
4 you explain what that means for the jurors? 
5 A Sure. When you download a semiautomatic 
6 weapon for our terminology, that means that the 
7 magazine is removed, all rounds that are in the 
8 magazine and whatever is chambered is removed and 
9 the slide is locked back. That's a safe way to 
10 store a weapon.

2 Q Okay. Let's go through those. Your first 
3 is Number 20, I believe? 
4 A It is. Once I removed the weapon, it was 
5 laid on top of the Ferguson Police Department's 
6 evidence envelope in exactly the condition that I 
7 removed it from. 
8 Q You and I talked about this yesterday, 
9 what's this thing right here? 
10 A That is just part of the seal on the back 
11 of their evidence envelope. I did not apply that 
12 and nor was it sealed.

3 A As a general rule, I always wear two sets 
4 of gloves. If the first set becomes contaminated or 
5 in this case, if I was to swab this for any other 
6 potential forensic evidence. That first set is 
7 removed before I move onto the next step and then 
8 another set of gloves is put on so I don't run the 
9 risk of cross-contamination. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So you are double gloved 
11 when you are handling this firearm? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Always. 
All right, yes? 
14 So the envelope, 
15 it was your understanding that was the first time it 
16 had been used was when that gun was put in? 
17 A I was just told it was placed in the 
18 envelope. 
19 By that picture, it looked 
20 like the envelope has been used before? 
21 
22

Q

1 clarification. What is the protocol for when you 
2 seize a weapon and it is placed in the evidence bag 
3 to be inspected, what's the protocol as far as 
4 putting it in there and everything else after that? 
5 A I can speak for the County Police 
6 Department, I can't speak for another agency, okay. 
7 We do not package firearms in this manner. 
8 If I go to a scene and there's a 
9 firearm laying there, okay. There's a standard 
10 protocol that we always follow, and I think you may 
11 have seen some of those from Detective 
12 We'll take an overall view, we'll 
13 take what is called a midrange view to tie in that 
14 firearm, if we are talking about bag this, where it 
15 is on this section of the table. The overall view 
16 would be the entire room, okay. Midrange view would 
17 say, well, it is near these two jurors and these two 
18 microphones. 
19 Then we would take a close-up view of 
20 it, but it is still in place. We have not 
21 manipulated it, we have not touched it and then what 
22 you folks will see here shortly we follow the same 
23 protocols as far as images. 
24 Once it is photographed in place, 
25 then wearing gloves, we will pick it up, usually lay

1 it on another surface, whether it is an evidence 
2 envelope or evidence box, which would be the County 
3 Police Department. We don't put fires arms in a 
4 package. 
5 And then we would lay that firearm, 
6 we would photograph both sides, we would take an 
7 image of the serial number, we would remove the 
8 magazine, photograph all of these things as they 
9 are, and then we would unload the magazines and 
10 whatever rounds in the magazine. We would display 
11 them next to the magazine to document, well, these 
12 are the rounds that we found in there. 
13 We would then lock the slide back and 
14 whatever is in the chamber or not in the chamber 
15 then we would document that. 
16 We would package those items 
17 separately, but they all go into one gun box. 
18 If we were to seize this and render 
19 it safe, then it would be inspected by another 
20 detective or one of my supervisors to confirm 
21 Detective looked at this gun and he cleared 
22 it, and I'm checking to make sure that it is cleared 
23 so everyone is safe. 
24 We would then put what's called a

1 trigger guard, which would be this section right 
2 here. And per our firearms unit, we would put in 
3 essence, it is a orange zip tie that runs from, if I 
4 can change images, Miss Alizadeh? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Sure, just identify the 
6 image you are going to put up there. 
7 A The next image is Number 21. This is the 
8 other side of the weapon. Again, our normal 
9 sequence. And right here would be the ejection 
10 port, that orange zip tie would initiate going 
11 through here, it comes out of the bottom of the 
12 magazine, goes in and then we would secure that. 
13 Then it is sent to the firearms unit 
14 to verify when that gun gets there, that it couldn't 
15 have accidently slide, go forward, it could have 
16 been knocked around or something. And we want to 
17 confirm when it goes to our crime lab personnel that 
18 that gun is safe, has been inspected and has been 
19 confirmed. 
20 So come back to your original, I 
21 can't speak for other departments, I can only share 
22 with you what is our protocol policy and procedure.

24 you take a picture of the envelope while the weapon

I have the question about 
3 the clothing. Is it common practice to have 
4 somebody travel from one spot to another before you 
5 take the clothing, I mean, I'm wondering is there a 
6 reason why somebody couldn't bring that to the 
7 hospital where he was instead of having him travel 
8 somewhere else before he got there for his clothing. 
9 A Again, ma'am, I can't address that, that 
10 was Ferguson's decision. If I was to work, and I've 
11 worked hundreds, if that was a County Police 
12 Department employee, we would have made arrangements 
13 to get clothes to him or her. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Does anybody, the first 
15 image of the weapon was Photograph Number 20, does 
16 anybody need that back up? We are moving back now 
17 for 21, which has been on the screen. Describe what 
18 you are seeing? 
19 A That is the other side or the right side 
20 of the weapon, the slide locked back. Visible in it 
21 serial number, as I explained earlier. 
22 And Image 22 is a close-up view of 
23 that serial number. You folks may not be able to 
24 see that. We can certainly pass that around. I

And were you told that Michael Brown may 
16 have had his hands on the weapon?

1 firearm, how would you go about examining that, do 
2 you want those firearm pictures again? 
3 A Just let me have one of them please, 
4 ma'am. 
5 Q How would you go about looking on that 
6 weapon for fingerprints? 
7 A Okay. Based on the information that I was 
8 told regarding the incident, I was informed that 
9 Darren Wilson while holding his firearm, his 
10 department issue pistol, while he's holding it, 
11 there was a struggle between Mr. Brown and 
12 Mr. Wilson while the officer was seated in his 
13 police vehicle and Mr. Brown was outside. 
14 So if you take that and say okay, 
15 well, the officer is holding his gun, he never 
16 relinquished it, the gun was never taken away, 
17 however, we are wrestling over this gun. 
18 Common sense would tell you that if 
19 I'm holding the handle of the gun here, then what 
20 opportunity or what else is the other person 
21 struggling over. Probably this area of the gun. 
22 The magazine was never released from 
23 the gun during the incident, it was never dropped or 
24 picked up, the officer never lost control of his 
25 gun.

Yes. 
Okay. So this is not to say that this is 
25 how it happened, but this is based upon your

1 experience and what you have been told at this point 
2 where you might expect to find fingerprints? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q Okay. You can then go ahead and talk 
5 about, you have to make kind of a decision between 
6 whether to swab for DNA or to look for fingerprints? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q So why did you make a decision to swab for 
9 DNA? 
10 A Based on training and experience, and also 
11 based on the information that I was given, you're 
12 not going to have fine ridge detail during a violent 
13 encounter. It would be different if this gun was 
14 like this and someone just came up, other than the 
15 officer, and touched it. 
16 When we process that, yes, you can 
17 get fine ridge detail. So the decision was made 
18 between myself and the crimes against person 
19 detective, homicide detective, that it would be 
20 better to swab the weapon. 
21 Now, if you are going to swab it, 
22 then you need to swab all the relevant areas that 
23 could be touched by someone other than Darren 
24 Wilson. 
25 Q Because, of course, you know Darren Wilson

A 
Exactly, he was holding it. 
It would tell you nothing if his DNA is on 
Absolutely not. 
We know he touched the gun? 
Right, it is his gun. 
All right. 
Once that decision is made and you swab, 
10 then you're going to have to swab those areas that 
11 were described earlier. If there was fingerprint 
12 evidence, you are going to be swabbing through them, 
13 so that's why you need to make a decision whether 
14 you want to process this for fingerprints or do you 
15 want to process this for DNA. 
16 Q And in processing this weapon for 
17 fingerprints, could you after that swab it for DNA? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No. 
So you had to pick one or the other? 
Right. 
And based upon your information and 
22 consulting with the detective, crime scene 
23 detective, not crime scene, crimes against person 
24 homicide detective, was a decision made to swab for 
25 DNA?

A 
Q 
A 
Page 45 
Yes, ma'am. 
And that's what you did? 
Yes. 
4 Q Did you package those swabs in the regular 
5 manner? 
6 A I did. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you have any questions 
8 about his processing this gun or about the gun 
9 itself or anything like that? 
10 Did you 
11 describe what type of gun is it again? 
12 A It is a Sig Sauer P229. It is a .40 
13 caliber weapon. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Just so you know and, of 
15 course, he is familiar with this weapon, but we will 
16 be calling, you know, someone from the crime lab 
17 that is an expert on ballistics and can answer all 
18 kind of questions about this weapon and how it fires 
19 and so forth. 
20 Once you swab 
21 the critical areas for DNA, is all of the DNA at 
22 that point removed from the object basically, it is 
23 rendered clean? 
24 A You might have a trace only because these 
25 are cotton swabs and when we swab something, we do

1 two at one time. One for the prosecuting attorney's 
2 office, that's going to end up going to the lab and 
3 potentially a defense attorney so we keep one on 
4 file. 
5 When you are holding these two cotton 
6 swabs, if you folks can picture Q-Tips, okay. You 
7 are holding two of them together, unless you're 
8 going back and forth and completely swabbing every 
9 little spot on this thing, you're not going to 
10 remove all of the DNA, all right. 
11 You're trying to get the most profile 
12 or profiles that you can by swabbing those areas 
13 back and forth. Kind of like painting a first coat, 
14 you're not going to paint, you're not going to cover 
15 everything with your first coat. The same thing 
16 applies when we're swabbing for DNA. So potentially 
17 could be DNA left on there, but we try to get the 
18 largest sample as we can. 
19 
20 A Yes, ma'am. 
21 I just need to know this. 
22 When the weapon was seized, before you got to the 
23 weapon. 
24 
25 
A Okay. 
It was in the envelope?

2 The protocol that the 
3 envelope is supposed to be sealed, you know, like 
4 you collect evidence and you get the bag, all the 
5 evidence is in the bag and you seal the bag until 
6 the right person comes and inspects the bag? 
7 A Again, I can speak for the County Police 
8 Department, yes. What I was told, the information 
9 that I was given is that it was just placed there 
10 for, in essence, conveyance or storage until I got 
11 there. 
12 And then, obviously, when I arrived 
13 and I processed or I seized or I package something, 
14 then I follow what the County Police Department 
15 crime scene unit and our crimes lab protocol as far 
16 as how we package things. 
17 Was it locked away or 
18 sitting out?

20 
A 
Q 
It was in the detective bureau on a desk. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Just for clarification, 
21 do you know does Ferguson Police Department have 
22 their own crime scene detective? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
They do. 
Were any of them that you know of involved 
25 with processing anything involved with this

1 shooting? 
A No, ma'am. 2 
3 Q In fact, Ferguson had asked county to come 
4 in and take over this investigation within maybe an 
5 hour of the shooting, would that be your 
6 understanding? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And so to your knowledge, did any Ferguson 
9 crime scene detectives have anything to do with 
10 seizing evidence, processing any scenes? 
11 A No, ma'am, that's why they requested my 
12 unit to respond. 
13 Q And so I'm only guessing or speculating, 
14 had a Ferguson crime scene detective actually seized 
15 this weapon, he might have handled it in a different 
16 manner than what was done in this case, would that 
17 be a guess or fair to say? 
18 A That would be accurate because Ferguson 
19 Police Department has sent some of their officers to 
20 the crime scene school that I teach at our academy. 
21 I'm confident in stating that they would probably 
22 have followed protocols if they were actually 
23 seizing pieces of evidence. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Any other 
25 clarifications?

1 Yes. You 
2 may have said it, who actually put the gun into the 
3 envelope? 
4 
5 
A I have no idea. 
Okay. Would there be an 
6 issue when you do the swab of somebody else's DNA on 
7 the gun. 
8 A What I was told is that Darren Wilson had 
9 unloaded his own weapon, so if he handed it to 
10 someone else, I was never informed of that. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, I will tell you we 
12 will have DNA people testify and they will tell you 
13 what DNA was found on that gun and if they can 
14 identify whose DNA it was. 
15 So as far as that goes and let me ask you, 
16 Detective did you take a swab from Darren 
17 Wilson at the hospital. 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So there was a sample of 
20 Darren Wilson's DNA taken by you at the hospital? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that is done by rubbing something on 
23 the inside of his cheek? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is called a buccal swab. 
And you are fully gloved?
