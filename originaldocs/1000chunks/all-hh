That's correct. 
Most of these interviews were recorded? 
Yes, some of them. 
Some of them? 
Yes. 
People that said they didn't see anything

25 your knowledge, did they record those type of

3 Q So people that said they saw something of 
4 substance or pertinent to the investigation, most of 
5 those interviews were recorded, but they were 
6 recorded on the scene by the agents, correct? 
7 A That's correct. 
8 Q Okay. And, in fact, when the county was 
9 investigating, a lot of their interviews were done 
10 at various locations, county libraries?

Q

Yes. 
The NCAA headquarters? 
NCAA? 
14 Q Did I say that wrong? What did I say? 
15 You know what I meant, I'm sorry. Attorneys, some 
16 of these witnesses had attorneys and interviews were 
17 done at attorney's office, correct? 
A That's correct. 18 
19 Q So basically you would go wherever you 
20 needed to go to talk to witnesses? 
A Correct. 21 
22 Q And same thing with the FBI, you are aware 
23 that they were interviewing witnesses during their 
24 investigation? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 Q And when they would interview witnesses at 
2 FBI headquarters, would they advise you in advance 
3 that they were going to be interviewing a witness? 
4 A They would. 
5 Q And so would you participate in that 
6 interview? 
7 A We would. 
8 Q And would you be asking witnesses 
9 questions during that interview as well? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Were there times when they conducted 
12 interviews where you did not participate in the 
13 interview? 
14 A There were. 
15 Q And on those occasions, would they get you 
16 the copies of the recordings of those interviews? 
17 A Yes, they would. 
18 Q Okay. And so I'm going to characterize 
19 some of these witnesses as FBI witnesses. You and I 
20 talk about the fact that we say, oh, so and so was 
21 an FBI witness. That would be somebody that the FBI 
22 had identified as a witness and that they had 
23 conducted the interview, correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
So when I talk about all witnesses that

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXIII November 13, 2014 
Page 233 
1 were interviewed, and not just the witnesses who 
2 said I wasn't home, or I was home but I didn't hear 
3 or see anything. But out of all the witnesses that 
4 were actually talked to that heard or saw something, 
5 between County Police and the FBI, can you give me 
6 an estimate how many people were interviewed? 
7 A Roughly 80. 
8 Q And then regarding other witnesses that 
9 may have been interviewed, from paramedics 
10 A I'm sorry, would you repeat your last 
11 question? Maybe I misunderstood here. 
12 Q Between the FBI and the County Police, can 
13 you give me an idea or an estimate about as to how 
14 many witnesses were interviewed, and I'm talking 
15 about eyewitness type people that said they saw or 
16 heard something that day? 
17 A I'd like to clarify that. That number is 
18 closer to 50. 
19 Q Okay. So when you say 80, were you 
20 including a different type of witness or other 
21 people? 
22 A I was. The 80 number is essentially those 
23 roughly 50, and then in addition to those roughly 
24 50, there would have been other people who have been 
25 in some form or another involved in some aspect of

1 the incident itself, or someone who we during the 
2 course of the investigation felt it would have been 
3 important for us to talk to. 
4 Q So the 50 relates to civilians who maybe 
5 said they were eyewitness to some part of this? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q So the additional witnesses are people 
8 like paramedics, the hospital personnel that treated 
9 Darren Wilson, correct?

A 
Q 
12 Market? 
13 A 
14 Q 
Correct. 
You spoke to the owners of the Ferguson 
Correct. 
At some point in your investigation did 
15 you learn that prior to the shooting, Michael Brown 
16 was involved in an incident that occurred up at the 
17 Ferguson Market? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And at some point did you obtain the video 
20 of that incident? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
We did. 
And at some point did you interview the 
23 owner and other people who were present during that 
24 incident,?

Page 235 
And during your interview of them, did 
2 their statements, let me ask you this. In the video 
3 we see that there's a bunch of people there? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q There's the shopkeeper who is in the video 
6 and we see his interaction with Michael Brown, but 
7 there's other people you can see in the video? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Were you able to identify everybody who 
10 appears in the video? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
We were not. 
So were you able to identify some people 
13 who appear in the video? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q And when you spoke to, when you spoke to 
16 the owner of the shop, the man who appears, the 
17 shorter man in the video, he doesn't speak fluent 
18 English; is that correct? 
A He does not. 19 
20 Q So you interviewed him with the assistance 
21 of an interpreter? 
A Yes, ma'am. 22 
23 Q And then you spoke to another witness who 
24 was present in the Ferguson Market for that incident 
25 is that right?

2 Q The statements of those people do they, 
3 were their statements consistent with what you see 
4 in the video? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Their statements were consistent, yes. 
Okay. Now, during the interviews, and 
7 we've seen in the video that there is no audio to 
8 the video, correct? 
9 A That's correct. 
10 Q And during the interviews of those people, 
11 and backing up a little bit, since your interview of 
12 these people, has there market been looted and 
13 burglarized and damaged during the riots that took 
14 place afterwards? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
It has, yes. 
And do you know, do the people who own 
17 that market feel that is because the citizens in 
18 that surrounding area talk, because they talk to the 
19 police? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
I believe so, yes. 
And have they expressed a reluctance, a 
22 huge reluctance to actually be assisting in the 
23 investigation? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Very much so, yes, very reluctant. 
And so when you spoke to the man in the

1 video through an interpreter, did you get any 
2 additional information about what was said or what 
3 was heard during that incident? 
4 A The male clerk, again, did not speak very 
5 good English and he couldn't necessarily recall what 
6 was being said, but he identified that curse words 
7 were being said by the individual he identified as 
8 Michael Brown. 
9 Q Okay. So he doesn't, he didn't know what 
10 the curse words were? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
He did not. 
But he was able to, but he knows that 
13 there were curse words? 
14 A He does, yes. 
15 Q Was there another person present at the 
16 Ferguson Market who also heard words being 
17 exchanged? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And what did that person say, 
20 if anything, does that person speak fluent English? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What, if anything, do you recall that 
23 person saying about what was heard between Michael 
24 Brown, Dorian Johnson, you know, any conversation 
25 between them or anything that was heard during the

1 incident? 
November 13, 2014 
Page 238 
2 A This person missed the initial portion of 
3 the encounter, however, at the end of the encounter, 
4 the person indicated that they observed Michael 
5 Brown pushing the store clerk and begin to walk 
6 away. The clerk then, I'm sorry, the clerk was 
7 pushed and Michael Brown took essentially one more 
8 step back towards the clerk after having been pushed 
9 and the individual said that they heard Michael 
10 Brown make a comment to the effect of, what the fuck 
11 are you going to do about it. 
12 Q Okay. And that person that heard that 
13 speaks English fluently? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And now during the course of the 
16 investigation, getting back to this, you've 
17 interviewed, you said hospital personnel, ambulance 
18 people, you've interviewed people up at the Ferguson 
19 Market, did you check for video surveillance in the 
20 apartment complex? 
21 A We checked several different ways. And we 
22 were able to determine that there was no video in 
23 the complex. 
24 Q Urn, at some point during the investigation 
25 did you hear a rumor or were there people that were

1 talking about the fact that there were video cameras 
2 on the buildings in the Canfield Green Apartment 
3 Complex and that police officers were observed to 
4 have been taking those cameras down on the day of 
5 the incident? 
6 A I did hear that, yes. 
7 Q And after having heard that, did you 
8 investigate that whether or not there were cameras 
9 that had been up there? 
10 A Well, during the initial investigation at 
11 the scene on the 9th, obviously, one of the things 
12 we do in this, and in every investigation, is look 
13 for cameras. So that was the top of our list of 
14 things to do to see if there was any video cameras. 
15 A lot of apartment complexes in the 
16 St. Louis area do have video cameras that they 
17 maintain themselves or there is other companies that 
18 come in and provide video security systems for the 
19 complex. 
20 So we thoroughly checked ourselves to 
21 see if there was any cameras on light poles or 
22 buildings or stairways, or whatever. We did not 
23 find anything. 
24 In addition to that, we contacted the 
25 on-site property manager for the Canfield Green

1 Apartment Complex and clarified with her our beliefs 
2 that there were no visible cameras, she said there 
3 were not. She said that they didn't have any other 
4 than one particular camera and that was an interior, 
5 inside the building in a basement camera that faced 
6 the laundry room that watched essentially the 
7 laundry area to make sure people weren't taking 
8 change out of the washing machines. 
9 In addition to that, we also 
10 contacted the, what I would call the corporate 
11 offices for the complex and we spoke with the owner 
12 of the complex who also confirmed there were no 
13 cameras in the complex. 
14 Q All right. You've never discovered that 
15 there were ever any cameras on the 9th, at least 
16 that were up in the complex that might have recorded 
17 any of this incident on Canfield? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Now, you learned during your investigation 
20 that there were several people that had used their 
21 phones or their personal electronic devices to 
22 record portions of what happened on that day, 
23 correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
That's correct. 
Have you ever learned that there was a 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXIII November 13, 2014 
Page 241 
1 recording that actually captured any part of the 
2 incident from the time the officer sees the two men 
3 walking down the street until after the shooting is 
4 over? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
So the videos that you discovered and seen 
7 all deal with the aftermath, after Michael Brown is 
8 already been shot and is dead in the street? 
9 A Yes, ma'am. 
10 Q Urn, and you're aware that there are a 
11 number of, still a number of witnesses or people who 
12 have given statements either to law enforcement 
13 officers or to other people that they have seen 
14 something to do with this, and yet they have not 
15 appeared before the grand jury? 
16 A That's correct. 
17 Q And that might be because we can't 
18 identify them. For example, there was a witness 
19 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
who said he was with somebody named 
Were we able to identify that person? 
We were not, no. 
And then talks about having 
23 a female in his car, but he doesn't know her name. 
24 Were we able to identify that opinions? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
We were not.

Q There is a person who talks about somebody 
named who maybe saw something, did we ever 
1 
2 
3 identify who was? 
4 A Not positively, no. 
5 Q Then there were a number of people who 
6 called, whether they called into the tip line, 
7 whether they made 911 calls, whether they made calls 
8 into radio, media, like the Tommy Sotomayor show, 
9 were there attempts to find out who those people 
10 were? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Multiple attempts, yes. 
And there were times when you were 
13 successful in finding out who those people were, for 
14 example, who is the person that called into Tommy 
15 Sotomayor? 
16 A 
17 Q But there are still 
18 other people that you were never able to identify 
19 who those persons were, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am. 20 
21 Q And then are there still a few witnesses 
22 who you have been able to identify who have said 
23 that they saw something, who refuse to make a 
24 statement to law enforcement officials? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, that's correct.

1 Q And are there still a number of witnesses 
2 who actually have made statements to law enforcement 
3 officials and who refuse to come in to testify to 
4 the grand jury, either because we can't find them 
5 now, they're hiding, they're out of state, or they 
6 might, we just can't get them in even if we serve 
7 subpoenas, they refuse to come in? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's true, yes. 
And so you and I and Sheila Whirley have 
10 been working very closely with the presentation of 
11 evidence during the investigation that began, the 
12 grand jury investigation that began on August 20th; 
13 is that right? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q And at times have I asked you to do 
16 various things that the grand jury has asked for? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Such as locate who Darren Wilson's field 
19 training officer was in Jennings? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And during your investigation did I ask 
22 you to go down to Canfield and take a number of 
23 photographs that again, I'll call perspective 
24 photographs that were, might show what somebody, 
25 what various witnesses might have seen on the day of

1 the shooting? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
I'm going to show you a series of 
Page 244 
4 photographs that are in Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
5 98. 
6 And you and I have gone over these 
7 photographs before and looked through them; is that 
8 right? 
A That's correct. 9 
10 Q And were you actually one of the, were you 
11 with the detective who actually took these 
12 photograph? 
13 A I was, yes. 
14 Q So describe for the grand jurors what you 
15 were doing here and what the goal was? 
16 A So essentially we made the decision to 
17 identify three particular points, specific points on 
18 Canfield, and stand in one particular spot of those 
19 three points. Take a series of consecutive 
20 overlapping photos in a 360-degree manner. 
21 So you could essentially put those 
22 photos together and you would get a 360-degree view 
23 of your surroundings. 
24 We decided to do that with three 
25 points. Those points would have been essentially at

1 the police car where the police car was originally 
2 located, at essentially the intersection of 
3 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive, this point 
4 right here. And then based on measurements that we 
5 took, again, this is all based on measurements, 
6 where Michael Brown's foot would have been the day 
7 of the incident, we used those three points of 
8 reference. 
9 Q Michael Brown's foot when he was laying in 
10 the street? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Those were measurements that you got from 
13 the crime scene diagram that was done by Detective 
14 on the day of the shooting? 
15 
16 
17 
A That's correct. 
Q So really we're going to go through some 
of these and we'll get through as many as we can. 
18 think at this point it will probably be we will see 
19 Detective back on Friday just to finish up 
I 
20 with him. I know Sheila has got some more with him, 
21 you all may have some questions and, of course, we 
22 have evidence for you to look at and view as well. 
23 So in this first image, which on the 
24 back I've marked as 1A. So all of the images that 
25 have a one, these are images from what vantage

1 point? 
2 A Uh, this would have been from Officer 
3 Wilson's police vehicle. 
4 A Okay. 
5 Q And so the detective photographed the cone 
6 in the street and this is where he was going to 
7 stand on top, not physically stand on top of the 
8 cone, but stand over the cone and turn while he made 
9 his photographs, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And so this image 1B, is that you can see 
12 the cone in this photograph and is this just to get 
13 a perspective of which view this is? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
It is. 
So this is not a perspective shot? 
That's a preparatory shot to identify 
17 where we're at. 
18 Q Okay. And so on 1C, this would be the 
19 first photograph that is a perspective shot from 
20 where Officer Wilson's vehicle was, correct? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And what direction is this looking? 
This is looking primarily south. 
Okay. And so if we know that the

1 see the front of the building says 2964, that's this 
2 location right here, correct? 
3 A That's correct. 
4 Q All right. And did you during your 
5 investigation identify if there was any witness that 
6 would have been in this photograph that would have 
7 said they witness something? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
No. 
And then in photograph 1D, is this, now 
10 the detective who is taking the photographs, if he 
11 started out by looking south on Canfield, is he 
12 turning clockwise? 
13 A He is. 
14 Q So now from this perspective, is he 
15 looking down which direction on Canfield? 
16 A He's looking west on Canfield. 
17 Q Okay. And so that would be looking in 
18 this direction, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And from this photograph which is where 
21 the police vehicle would have been, can you see a

where

Q 
said he was standing? 
Yes. 
And presumably if you had taken a 
12 photograph from that location, would you be able to 
13 see where the police car was? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And then Exhibit 1E, in this 
16 grouping is again turning clockwise so. What 
17 building are we seeing in this photograph? 
18 A We are looking at this third photograph 
19 right here. This is 2973, which is part of Building 
20 2 and 2969, which is also part of Building 2. We 
21 can see a little bit of Building 3 on the far 
22 right-hand side.

1 right at the end of the picture? 
2 A Right. So the detective when he was 
3 taking the photograph would have been standing where 
4 the car was when he took that photograph. 
5 Okay. What about where the 
6 body laid at? 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: That's in another group of 
8 photographs. There's the car photographs, there's a 
9 point where he may have turned around by that pole 
10 and then there's where the body laid. 
11 What's the estimated 
distance from the car to where was? 12 
13 A From the car, I'm not sure I'd have to 
14 look it up. 
15 A couple hundred yards, 
16 100 yards, someone with good eyesight would be able 
17 to see clearly in your opinion? 
18 A Yes. I would say maybe not even 
19 100 yards.

1 it does through the camera? Would you be able to 
2 see more of it or would it be larger? 
3 A Urn, I think that is probably pretty 
4 consistent with what you would see. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You were out there on 
6 that day, correct? 
7 A I was. 
8 Q When they were taking photographs? 
9 A I was, yes. 
10 Q And did you discuss with, was there 
11 discussion between myself, my office, and you guys 
12 that we wanted to have, we didn't want zoom 
13 pictures? 
14 A That's right. 
15 Q We wanted to have a lens that would be as 
16 close to the human, what an eye would see? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q So none of these pictures are zoomed in to 
19 what they are focused on?

1 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, regarding your 
2 recollection of his testimony, y'all can compare 
3 notes on that or look back on the transcript. I'd 
4 rather not comment on where I think was or, you 
5 know, and we have a map here too that is also done 
6 for your assistance that also puts points where the 
7 detectives involved in the investigation believe 
8 people were, but that's only to assist you. These 
9 are just to assist you. 
10 So if your recollection is different or if 
11 you do not agree with what the pictures show or what 
12 the testimony is, that's your prerogative to agree 
13 or disagree or have different recollections, okay. 
14 So detective looking at this photograph 1E 
15 and you said now in this photograph we can see 
16 Building Number 2 and part of Building Number 3, can 
17 you, do you know who lived in Building Number 2 that 
18 said they were witness to this, do you need to look 
19 at the map?

In Building Number 2 would have been

1 the police car, someone who is on the balcony here 
2 very well could have seen what happened at the 
3 police car, is that fair to say? 
4 A That's fair to say. 
5 Who lived here, who did you 
6 say? 
7 A and 
8 
9 Q 
Can I look at the map just to clarify that? 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Just so we can make the 
10 record clear, I'm going to just, I don't have 
11 another easel yet today, we're going to get one for 
12 you, but this is a map that has 
13 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 101 
14 marked for identification.) 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
16 101 is the same map that has little stickers that 
17 show where various people say that they were, 
18 correct? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. 
20 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And you prepared that 
21 for me; is that right? 
22 A I did.

marked for identification.) 1 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Is this a legend that 
3 you prepared that corresponds with the number you 
4 gave those people? 
A It is. 5 
6 Q Just so that you all know, you know, I've 
7 been numbering witnesses as we go. The numbers that 
8 he assigns here have nothing to do with the order 
9 that they testified, so don't go by a witness 
10 number, you know, 43 is where, okay. 
11 The legend, I might as well pass it 
12 all out to you, but this helps you to recall who was 
13 in that Building Number 2, correct? 
14 A It does. 
15 Q All right. And on your little markings 
16 you have Number 25, who is Number 25? 
17 A It is, as I said, it is , and 
Number 10 is and Number 9 is
