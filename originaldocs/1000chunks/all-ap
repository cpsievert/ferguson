6 we've seen where his clothing is removed, correct? 
7 A Correct. So here we have the head, there 
8 is the feet, Mr. Michael Brown's clothing has been 
9 removed. Once again we have that identifying 
10 placard and this is his body without the clothing. 
11 This is Image 60. We have the 
12 identifying placard, this is Mr. Michael Brown, this 
13 is looking at the right side of his body with his 
14 clothing removed, feet are here, head is here, that 
15 right arm is extended coming out at you. 
16 This should be Image 61. This is 
17 Mr. Michael Brown, clothing removed and then once 
18 again the officer who is taking the photos, he has 
19 ascended upon the stair step ladder to get an 
20 overall view of Mr. Michael Brown without his 
21 clothing. 
22 Image 62. This is showing the lower 
23 half of Mr. Michael Brown's body without the 
24 clothing and here is the legs and the lower portion

This is Image 63. Looking at the

3 visualization of one of those identifying tattoos on 
4 the, kind of the upper portion of the right arm. 
5 Q Now, just for clarification sake, what is 
6 this thing right here? 
7 A That's just a paper towel that is 
8 sometimes used to remove blood or to get rid of 
9 anything that's obscuring anything that I'm trying 
10 to see. 
11 This is Image 64. And this is just a 
12 close-up of that tattoo, you know, with the blood 
13 that was obscuring it removed from the upper right 
14 arm. 
15 This is Image 65. This is a better 
16 image of the forearm with that identifying tattoo, 
17 still see a wound here near the bicep and this is 
18 the right arm and then that wound of the right hand. 
19 This is 66. This is just a better 
20 image of that identifying tattoo on the right 
21 forearm, Big Mike. 
22 This is 67. This is the left arm 
23 now, the head is here, the feet would be out here, 
24 this is the left arm and we are looking at the 
25 forearm with the identifying tattoo and that injury

2 This is 68. So this is the left 
3 forearm with the identifying tattoo and then there 
4 is this linear abrasion out here on the left 
5 forearm. And this is the front part or ventral part 
6 or anterior part of the forearm. 
7 This would be 69. And with all cases 
8 we have it is important to look at the back side of 
9 the body as well as the front, and that involves the 
10 external examination. So here Mr. Michael Brown's 
11 body is being rolled by the autopsy technician 
12 so we can document that there are no 
13 injuries to the back side of the torso.

1 because your hands can move from one way or another 
2 anatomically, would it be correct that in an 
3 anatomical diagram the person would be standing 
4 upright and their palms would be forward? 
A That is correct. 5 
6 Q So if you are describing an injury on the 
7 palm, that would be a front injury to the front of 
8 the hand, anterior, ventral? 
9 A It is still ventral. The front would be 
10 anterior, it could be ventral, all of those are 
11 interchangeable terms or palmar, they are all the 
12 same, all the same thing. Just depicts the front 
13 portion of that body part in the standard anatomical 
14 position. And when I document the injury, it is 
15 always from this position. This is my reference 
16 point. (indicating) 
17 Q So when you're talking about, for example, 
18 an injury to the forearm, your forearms move when 
19 you turn your palms outward, correct? 
20 A Correct. 
21 Q So when you are talking about front or 
22 anterior, you have to imagine that this is a person 
23 whose palms is facing out. We might think this is 
24 the inside of our arm, he doesn't describe it that 
25 way. So for clarification, imagine that your arms

3 the legs just stay the way they are.

6 
A 
Q 
A 
The way they are, yeah. 
Sorry. 
No, that's fine, excellent point. 
7 I think I can start trying to 
8 describe some of these. 
9 Q So we're going to start with some wounds 
10 now? 
11 A This is Image 70. And the wound I will be 
12 talking about first will be Number 9. 
13 The next photo is going to be closer, 
14 but just to kind of let you know, so this is Number 
15 9 that we're looking at. Specifically I term this 
16 is medial ventral right forearm. 
17 So what that means is, I will stand 
18 up so you guys can see. So the normal anatomical 
19 position is like this. So when I'm saying medial, 
20 medial is in reference to, you know, draw an 
21 imaginary line down the middle of that particular 
22 extremity, medial is to the inside, lateral is going 
23 to be to the outside of that imaginary line. 
24 Ventral, as we have already discussed 
25 before, is talking about the front part of that

1 particular extremity or whatever we are looking at. 
2 It is also synonymous with anterior, front or 
3 whatnot. 
4 When I say medial ventral, or right 
5 forearm, so talking about something that is off the 
6 midline inside, which makes it medial. Ventral 
7 meaning it is on the front and depicting a 
8 particular area which is the right forearm. So 
9 that's the terminology. So, and we're talking about 
10 this wound right here. 
11 So this next image, which will be 71, 
12 showing a close-up of wound Number 9. 
13 So a lot of this is just jargon for 
14 me to be able to say where it actually is on the 
15 body in terms of reference points. So with all of 
16 my gunshot injuries, I like to have two reference 
17 points. 
18 One of them is a fixed point, so in 
19 this particular situation, I find something is going 
20 to be the right elbow and I'm going to say how far 
21 above or down it is to be able to specify, you know, 
22 the upper dimension or the lower dimension, which is 
23 kind of just your natural body axis. 
24 So in this particular situation this 
25 wound is 15 centimeters below this right elbow, and

Page 103 
1 then you want to be able to say where in the midline 
2 that is and that lets me know medial or lateral. 
3 So in this particular situation, this 
4 particular wound is 5 centimeters to the left of the 
5 anterior midline of the right forearm. 
6 So when I say left, it is from my 
7 left, not from you looking at me. 
Q From the body's left? 8 
9 A From the body's left. So this is the 
10 right side of my body, since I'm going to the left, 
11 I'm going over here, that's how it gets to where it 
12 is supposed to be. 
13 So from that point, what I want to do 
14 after that is, I measure all of the wounds in terms 
15 of dimensions to see how big it is. In this 
16 particular situation it is about 2 centimeters wide 
17 as it is long. So it is 20 millimeters by 20 
18 millimeters or 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters, 
19 whatever you want to use. It is the same changeable 
20 amount. 
21 Once you do that, you want to look at 
22 the edges of the wound, meaning why that is 
23 important, with exit wounds as well as entrance 
24 wounds, there is particular identifying 
25 characteristics that you can see on a case by case

1 basis. They are not always there, but there is 
2 certain things that kind of give me inside track to 
3 kind of figuring out what it is. 
4 So in this particular situation when 
5 I'm looking at the edge of this wound, it is more 
6 irregular, it is kind of like, you know, someone 
7 kind of took a bite out of it, it is not a nice 
8 smooth circle or oval, it is more irregular. These 
9 edges are kind of tattered and look different. 
10 So I specify how that looks to me. 
11 So in this particular situation I say that there's 
12 irregular edges, the wound is irregular and it is 
13 also clean, meaning that I don't see any type of 
14 injury to the actual edge of the wound. 
15 Exit wounds, classically, this is 
16 kind of how they look. So once all of that is done, 
17 I'm able to say at this point that this is an exit 
18 wound. 
19 So once I'm familiar with this as an 
20 exit wound, eventually I'm going to want to try to 
21 find out where the entrance wound is. 
22 So we know where we are on the arm, 
23 on the right arm, we are on the inside portion of 
24 the arm and we are off medially of that midline. So 
25 this is the exit wound of that right forearm.

A 
Q 
A 
That's just blood, dried blood. 
Okay. 
When the blood coagulates, it darkens, 
7 that is what a clotted piece of blood looks like 
8 after it sits there too long, that is what that is. 
9 Q In your report when you describe these 
10 various wounds or injuries, you talk about there 
11 being no stippling and no soot present? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And you didn't find any stippling or soot 
14 on this wound, but why don't you explain to them 
15 what that is and what that means to you? 
16 A All right. So the concepts of stippling 
17 and soot. Stippling, so let's just take a step 
18 back. 
19 You have a bullet and it's fired out 
20 of a gun, a bullet is made up of like a primer, it 
21 is kind of the igniting substance that's within the 
22 actual bullet. And when that hammer of that gun 
23 strikes that primer, kind of combusts and kind of 
24 explodes, for lack of a better word, and then lights 
25 the gunpowder that's within the actual bullet. That

Page 106 
1 ends up being propelled and that's what allows the 
2 bullet to come out of the barrel of the gun. 
3 The concept with stippling is that 
4 when that primer ignites that gunpowder, in theory 
5 it all combust or burn, thus ultimately turning into 
6 soot, but when it doesn't turn into soot, you still 
7 have unburned particles that are real small, but due 
8 to the fact that they are being projected or shot 
9 out of that barrel of the gun, they are able to 
10 injure the skin. And those injuries of the skin is 
11 called stippling. So you will see little small 
12 individual dots around a wound. 
13 What is important about the stippling 
14 is it helps you with the range of where that weapon 
15 is fired from. 
16 So just roughly it depends on gun to 
17 gun, bullet to bullet, but roughly if you see 
18 stippling, you can say that that gun was fired a 
19 foot and a half to 3 feet to that particular part of 
20 the body. So that's what stippling is good for. 
21 Now soot is, what I just kind of 
22 briefly mentioned, is when that primer kind of 
23 combusts, then lights that gunpowder, that gunpowder 
24 thus combusts and then it turns into soot, that's 
25 going to come out of the gun as well. When that

Page 107 
1 comes out of the barrel of the gun that can be 
2 deposited on the skin. 
3 The concept of soot is when you see 
4 soot on the body, you are looking at something 
5 that's closer than a foot and a half. You start to 
6 look and say that particular bullet was probably 
7 fired within 6 to 9 inches, or 6 to 12 inches of the 
8 actual body. So that's the importance of mentioning 
9 do I see soot, do I see stippling, so I describe 
10 what they are, and I describe what the importance of 
11 them is. 
12 So at the end of the day, it is 
13 really helpful with range of where that particular 
14 projectile was fired from the gun. 
15 Q And in this case, you do describe in each 
16 wound whether there was present stippling or soot, 
17 but this being an exit wound Number 9, you wouldn't 
18 expect to see any soot or stippling knowing it is an 
19 exit wound, correct? 
20 A Correct, wouldn't expect to see that, so 
21 that's another thing to let you know that okay, this 
22 is most likely an exit wound. We don't see those 
23 features, you don't always have to see them. That 
24 is something that kind of puts you in that category 
25 we are not dealing with a close wound.

Is there 
2 any question ever at this particular point in the 
3 examination that those wounds were caused by a

5 A Urn, for me for the amount that I've seen, 
6 I've seen enough that I myself know that it was a

8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You will describe in a 
9 minute the corresponding entrance wound, but 
10 sometimes it is probably just a layman's term, we 
11 call that a through and through where a projectile 
12 passes entirely through the body. Is that something 
13 you've seen in gunshot wounds?

19 everything? 
20 A Yes, so we've described all of the 
21 important features for this particular wound. I'm 
22 convinced that this is an exit wound, so I know that 
23 there is an entrance wound somewhere else on the 
24 body, so that's my next step eventually when I get 
25 there.

Seven or Six? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is that an exit wound? 
This is Number 7. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And that's an exit wound? 
Yes, I'm about to describe it. So we're 
8 looking at Number 7. So the particular location is 
9 the upper dorsal right arm. 
10 So what we are talking about is, 
11 remember I was telling you about the forearm is 
12 going to be from the wrist to the elbow, the upper 
13 arm is going to be from the elbow to the shoulder. 
14 So upper arm, that's where we are at. And then when 
15 I say dorsal, and dorsal means the back part. 
16 So we are looking, you know, 
17 anatomically speaking, if you turn around like this, 
18 if you look back here, this is kind of where this 
19 wound is. It is here. So that's the dorsal part of 
20 the upper part of the right arm. And then that's 
21 where we are at right now in terms of position. 
22 Now, once you look at it, what is 
23 important is now I go through that same type of 
24 algorithm that I had before. You want to look at 
25 the contour of it, so this one is a little more

1 stretched out, more linear as opposed to that other 
2 wound, which is a little more irregular. Not really 
3 a big deal, but you still want to take the same type 
4 of approach in describing what you see. 
5 So this particular one, that's kind 
6 of the shape and it's length is 18 millimeters by 10 
7 milliliters. In terms of location, I do that again, 
8 two fixed points. When I say how far it is from the 
9 shoulder and say where it is from the midline, I've 
10 done that. 
11 Then you want to assess the edges, 
12 meaning assessing the edges is determining how they 
13 appear to you because that is going to be important 
14 to determine whether it is entrance or exit. 
15 In this particular situation, they 
16 are a little bit irregular, but there is no type of 
17 additional margin around it, it is still a clean 
18 wound. 
19 So when I say clean, there is no 
20 contusion, there is no abrasion around it, it is 
21 just coming, coming right back out the skin, making 
22 really no abnormalities to it. 
23 So with me seeing that, this once 
24 again let's me know that this is another exit wound, 
25 but on a different part of the body. I know that I

1 have an entrance wound someplace else. So this 
2 would be Number 7 where it is located. Do I have 
3 any questions about that? 
4 So what explains 
5 the elongated hole rather than a round hole? 
6 A A lot of times it is the actual tissue of 
7 where it is. So if you have an area where there is 
8 more fat on the arm, this particular area you can 
9 get a more elongated wound. 
10 You have different types of soft 
11 tissue make up there. So depending on where you get 
12 hit, you are going to see different types of 
13 orientation of the wound or contours of the wound. 
14 So that is kind of a more fatty area of the body, so 
15 it is going to stretch out a little bit more as 
16 opposed to a place that's tighter, where the skin is

18 type of wound and more irregular. 
19 If you feel your forearm yourself and 
20 you kind of tense it up, your forearm is lot tighter 
21 as oppose to the back side of your arm. 
22 This is Image 74. And this is the 
23 same exit wound and we're looking, only difference 
24 is we just introduced the ruler for scale.

1 at Wound Number 11 on the autopsy report. We are 
2 looking at the ventral surface of the right thumb, 
3 or near the ventral surface of the right thumb. So 
4 anatomical position like this. So we are looking at 
5 the front part, anterior part of the ventral part of 
6 the hand. We are looking at the right hand is where 
7 we are at right now. 
8 This is 76. There is a lot going on 
9 here and I will just try to do it step by step. 
10 Wound number, so this is 76, Wound Number 11. So we 
11 are looking at the ventral surface of the right 
12 thumb. 
13 So in terms of describing this one, 
14 this wound has looked a little bit different than 
15 the two that I just kind of showed you guys earlier. 
16 This one is more elongated, meaning it is more 
17 stretched out as opposed to being like a circle. 
18 When you look at it, what is 
19 important to realize is appreciating the elongating 
20 nature and then two, there's these little tags that 
21 you see, kind of like little sharks teeth. These 
22 tags are ultimately going to be important for 
23 determining the direction that you can say the 
24 bullet is coming out of the gun and how it struck 
25 his hand, but I will get to that part after I kind

2 The fact that I'm looking at this 
3 kind of elongated wound, I'm seeing this kind of 
4 shark teeth, call them skin tags. I know that this 
5 is like a graze wound or a tangential wound. 
6 Tangential just means that it is going parallel to 
7 the surface of whatever it is striking. 
8 So in this particular situation, got 
9 that, and then you want to measure it, which we've 
10 done. And the measurement is just five centimeters 
11 by two centimeters, and it is orientating kind of a 
12 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock fashion. It is 12 o'clock 
13 to 6 o'clock based off the anatomical position. So 
14 we are kind of going from down, or down to up or 
15 however you want to do it, it is no big deal. 
16 All right. What is important about 
17 these skin tags is how it lets you know what 
18 particular way the bullet is coming from. The skin 
19 tags point towards where the gun, the barrel of the 
20 gun is. 
21 I'll come up here and show you. If 
22 the gun, the barrel of the gun is pointed this way, 
23 this is the way that the bullet is going to be 
24 traveling. These skin tags point back towards the 
25 barrel of the gun. You can't refute it. It is what

1 it is. These tags are pointing back this way. They 
2 are pointing towards this. 
3 So I know for a fact that the bullet 
4 is coming this way. It is going like that. 
5 (indicating) 
6 Now, in terms of the anatomical 
7 position of the body, in order to keep both 
8 reference points the same, I'm still like this. So 
9 the reason that my trajectory is up is because it is 
10 just going up based on what the body is going 
11 towards the head because I'm like this. 
12 In real life did it go up? Can't 
13 really say that, but just having the anatomical 
14 position of how I have to stay static so that I can 
15 have a reference point every time that I can discuss 
16 these, you have got to keep yourself like this and 
17 my direction of upward is purely based off of being 
18 like this. I want you to make sure that you 
19 understand that. 
20 So what I know at this point is I 
21 have a tangential wound, I know which way it is 
22 going, I know which way it is coming from. 
23 Now other things that are important 
24 at this point with this wound, I can see it better 
25 on here. It is better to see the discoloration that

1 you have. You can kind of see, it is kind of dark 
2 here, kind of black, but here is it is a lot darker. 
3 Can I show? 
4 If you look at the hand, and I will 
5 kind of walk around. If you see that material in 
6 there, you can't really appreciate it too well on 
7 the screen, but that's something where we are 
8 talking about soot and talking about stippling, this 
9 is where this is coming into play. This isn't 
10 stippling, the stippling, I told you, is unburned 
11 particles that cause the little dots on the skin. 
12 This is soot, which is the burned gunpowder that's 
13 coming out of the barrel of the gun and it is being 
14 deposited on the skin discoloring it and leaving it 
15 there. So there is soot there on the hand. 
16 
17 
MS. WHIRLEY: So what does soot look like? 
So that means that it was 
18 a close range to the gun? This entered his body or 
19 grazed his body at a closer range to the gun than it 
20 would be if it was stippling or nothing at all? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
A 
Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: What does soot look like? 
Soot looks like, like you get charcoal and 
24 kind of the stuff that you have left over that is 
25 just black matter. That's what, it is just

Q 
Yes, I did. 
I mean, we can go ahead and talk about 
10 that now since we are talking about this wound. 
11 A Can I make sure they all see good, so then 
12 I will talk about that. 
13 So front 
14 of the body facing this way, it can also that it 
15 entered, can it be entered this way too? 
16 A Well, just how you did it, it has to be 
17 like that. If you are sitting there, I have to be 
18 above like that for it to come. That's the only way 
19 it can come, it can't come any other way, or if you 
20 are like this or you are like that or you are like 
21 this. There's lots of different ways regardless, it 
22 has to be coming at you that way, you can't get it 
23 coming this way. 
24 Okay.

2 What 
3 again is the maximum distance you would expect to 
4 see soot? 
5 A Soot, it depends, it is a gun by gun 
6 basis. It is a primer, gunpowder thing, but about 6 
7 to 9 inches roughly where the discharge of that 
8 material would be left on the body. 
9 Is there a middle 
10 distance, like if his hand was on the end of the 
11 barrel, would you still see the soot, so it is up to 
12 that 6 to 9 inches? 
13 A You would still get some discharge of 
14 material if his hand was there, but the problem with 
15 that is, so when you say hand, you mean like? 
16 He was reaching out 
17 struggling for the gun? 
18 A You are like that, the wound is going to 
19 look different. Now we are dealing with a contact 
20 wound. If you are talking about actually physically 
21 holding something, that's something extra and 
22 different. 
23 And for myself, let me take a step 
24 back about the soot and stippling. Stippling, when 
25 I see it, that lets me know that I'm dealing with an

1 intermedia type of wound, meaning that it is like 
2 maybe like a foot and a half to 3 feet away. Then I 
3 have indeterminate wounds where I don't see 
4 stippling, don't see soot, I do know it's an 
5 entrance wound, so there is nothing extra on the 
6 wound to let me know about closeness. So in that 
7 situation, those are called indeterminate. They are 
8 probably 3 feet or further away, that's all I can 
9 say. 
10 Soot, like we just discussed, we're 
11 talking about 6 to 9 inches. Contact wound, if it 
12 is a contact wound, so we are talking about we are 
13 up close and personal to whatever it is. 
14 So with that you are going to see 
15 different type of characteristics on the scene, you 
16 are going to see more searing or burning of that 
17 skin because there is hot particles and gas escaping 
18 from that weapon that are going to cause alterations 
19 of that skin surface. 
20 And when you actually examine the 
21 wound, you may see that soot type material deposited 
22 deep into the tissue or be black and deeper on the 
23 inside than the outside, or you may see a muzzle 
24 imprint. A muzzle imprint is where the end of the 
25 gun actually is so close to the skin surface or body

1 surface where it leaves the end part of that barrel 
2 imprint on the hand. So those are some of the 
3 things you look for a contact wound. 
4 So closest thing you've got of a 
5 contact wound, next is a close range wound with the 
6 stippling, I'm sorry, soot. And then intermediate 
7 is where we are dealing with stippling, and then the 
8 last thing is indeterminate, too far away, you can't 
9 determine. That's kind of my range of wounds and 
10 what the actual terms of contact, close, 
11 intermediate and indeterminate mean. 
12 This is 
13 telling us that it was a closer range and that the 
14 hand was open, not around --
15 A All I can say it is a close range wound. 
16 For him to get that, he is within 6 to 9 inches of 
17 however scenario you want to create in your head, 
18 that's all that that means.

2 So as I said before, when I'm doing 
3 an autopsy, part of a complete autopsy examination 
4 is sometimes you have histology. Histology is the 
5 preparation of tissues that you take from the body, 
6 you process through some dehydration steps, alcohol 
7 step, you eventually put it into a block of paraffin 
8 wax. Where you then take microtone, which is just a 
9 blade and cut off a very thin silver of that tissue, 
10 put it on a glass slide and then using different 
11 type of dyes, pink dye, a blue dye, you are able to 
12 stain it. And then I get a slide back and then I 
13 put that under my microscope and then I can see the 
14 histology. That's just the study of tissues under a 
15 microscope. 
16 In this situation I took some small 
17 pieces of skin from those areas of discoloration and 
18 I did histology on them. I got those back, and I 
19 looked under there, under the microscope. And when 
20 I can see in my actual skin sample is, I see foreign 
21 particles of matter, and what that means is, there 
22 is some of them are pigmented, some of them have 
23 different colors, but there is material there that 
24 he wasn't born with that had to be introduced into 
25 his skin as foreign material. I know that much.

7 particulate matter that had to be introduced into 
8 his skin. 
9 Now the next step is well, okay, 
10 where did it come from.

12 I've seen from textbooks that I have looked in

14

17 
histology and from what I have seen in the past, the 
material that I'm seeing is consistent with products 
that are discharged from the barrel of a firearm. 
So that's why I can look at that 
picture on my eye, it looked concerning for some 
18 type of extracorporeal, meaning something that is 
19 coming from outside of the body. Some extra matter 
20 that I wanted to figure out what it was. 
21 It is not something that he woke up 
22 in the morning with or something like that, but 
23 taking those samples with my pictures as well as 
24 looking at the histology, was consistent with 
25 products that are discharged from the barrel of a

1 firearm. 
2 And lots of products come out of a 
3 firearm. You have primer material, you have metal 
4 fragments, gunpowder, soot, you get all kind of 
5 things. There is mixture of things that are in 
6 there, that are foreign. That's why I say it is 
7 consistent with products discharged from the barrel 
8 of a firearm, does that make sense? 
9 So did everybody get, I didn't get to 
10 specifically say the areas I'm concerned about, you 
11 can see the dark. 
12 I have one question, 
13 So that wound, the hand wound, so 
14 basically the projectile, there was no exit wound? 
15 A Exactly, it is just running along the skin 
16 surface. It is a graze wound.
