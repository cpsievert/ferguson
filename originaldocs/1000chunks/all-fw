1 A I did do the swabbing. And since there 
2 was, there was a blood stain on the pants. So when 
3 I was swabbing for trace, I avoided that stain. 
4 Q Okay. And now if we look at the other 
5 report, which is Grand Jury Exhibit 68, Q22 through 
6 Q26. Now, this report looks like it is done on a 
7 different day, or is entered on a different day, and 
8 it is also, I imagine, tested on a different day; is 
9 that correct?

know why it wasn't all given to you 
And typically this happens when 
case right away, right after it 
15 happens. Sometimes all the evidence doesn't come in 
16 at the same time. So in this case, I worked all 
17 that I had on the first date and then we received 
18 more to be tested. So I did that work on a later 
19 date, like a week later. I work part-time. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
So everything would have been done on a 
22 Tuesday or a Thursday.

1 Q And by that, I mean, you had mentioned 
2 that kind of first-come first-serve, or something to 
3 that effect, generally as you work cases. Was this 
4 case given a priority?

A 
Q 
A 
It was. 
Because of the significance? 
The significance and the sensitivity of 
8 the nature of the case. 
9 Q Okay. So there was a baseball cap, Q22, 
10 that a swabbing, it says, so you swabbed the 
11 baseball cap? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And then the flip flop, a separate 
14 swabbing was retained for trace. Did you do 
15 something with the flip flop in Q23? 
16 A Yes, there were some reddish brown stains, 
17 so I tested those for blood, but then I also tested 
18 for trace, or as I mentioned before, kind of a wear 
19 profile to identify whose they were. 
20 Q And then it looks like you did in Q24, 
21 that was another flip flop, and in Q25 is the 
22 bracelet?

19 number assigned by the county for which case it is, 
20 and the Q number and my initials and DSN, which is

10 just identifying the photograph by a number. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: We've done that in the 
12 past. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Right, okay. So that first 
14 one, Kathi had put it on, and you have kind of 
15 already told us about this one. But again, what are 
16 we looking at now that everybody can see it. 
17 A That is what, again, because I didn't know 
18 exactly what it was at the time, but that was what I 
19 called apparent skin, or hardened nasal mucus, from 
20 outside of the car on the door. 
Q Okay. 21 
22 A You can see it's small, the measurement is 
23 in centimeters. 
24 Q I see. And those numbers at the top, that 
25 99 represents what?

1 A 99 represents County. 
2 Q Their municipal code? 
3 A Their municipal codes to, like Ballwin is 
4 like 02. So anything that is not in a municipality 
5 is considered County, which is 99. 14 is the year, 
6 and the 43984 is just the actual number that was 
7 assigned. 
8 Q Okay. And then that Q11 would correspond 
9 with the report that we have that has Q11; is that 
10 correct? 
11 A Yes. 
12 Q We look on our report dated, entered on 
13 8/11/2014. Q11 says one small piece of apparent

2 Number 26 photo was, correct? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Number 27, was it forwarded to DNA for 
5 analysis? 
6 A The shirt, yes. This is -- I swabbed the 
7 left side of the shirt, the collar, the shirt area, 
8 for trace. Again, the alleged contacted between 
9 Michael Brown and Officer Wilson. So I would have 
10 just taken a sterile swab, got it wet, swabbed the 
11 area, and did that for DNA.

A 
That's the actual shirt? 
That is the shirt. This picture is a

MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask a question? In 
17 the old days you used to take cuttings from fabric 
18 items, correct? When I say the old days, might have 
19 been before your time. 
20 
21 
A We did. You can do either. 
MS. ALIZADEH: In this case you didn't 
22 take cuttings?

24 larger area surface area. If I'm actually taking a 
25 swab to get the most possible DNA with trace cases

1 with trace evidence, there is not going to be as 
2 much DNA left behind as if someone is bleeding. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
4 A So to try to maximize that rather than 
5 take a cutting of a small area. Plus, you don't 
6 know where, you know, where there was contact. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Correct. And in this case, 
8 when you visually examine this shirt, did you see 
9 anything that looked like apparent blood? 
10 
11 
A No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And had you seen something 
12 that looked like apparent blood, would you have 
13 actually swabbed that spot? 
14 A Yes. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: But in this case, because 
16 you didn't see anything, you just kind of doing a 
17 broad brush on the shirt? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And that's cause you have 
20 had information from a case officer that perhaps 
21 Michael Brown touched the shirt of the officer on 
22 the left side? 
23 A Yes.

4 
A 
A 
Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: The shirts repackaged? 
The shirt was, yes, kept in. Would have 
5 been finished, completed and sent to property 
6 control, which is our evidence goes. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Would that be true for all 
8 clothing items, is that you just submit the swabs to 
9 DNA? 
10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
(By Ms. Whirley) And repackage? 
The actual clothing items, they weren't 
13 sent to DNA. It would be either cuttings that I 
14 took or swabbings that I took, that would go to DNA. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And to be clear on this 
16 shirt, you swabbed two areas, the collar area; is 
17 that correct? 
18 
19 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: When you say the collar 
20 area because this collar goes all away the around 
21 the shirt, was it what area? 
22 A I just swabbed anything on the left front 
23 side. Nothing around the back. So I think in the 
24 other picture is better.

1 identified that as 28. So you can see the shirt, 
2 there's a laser pen right in front of you, laser 
3 pointer. Can you show the jurors when you talk 
4 about swabbing the collar, where did you swab? 
5 A So, I would have swabbed or I did swab 
6 this area right here, just the front. And then the 
7 left side of the shirt, all right here.

9 
10 
A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Including the sleeve? 
Including the sleeve, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So when you swabbed that 
11 left side, the whole left side of the shirt pretty 
12 much, did you just use one swab or did you take 
13 several swabs of that area? 
14 A I think I took two. Usually something in 
15 that area, that big I would have taken two, two 
16 swabs. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Both of those were 
18 forwarded to DNA? 
19 
20 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And then for the collar, 
21 did you do one or two, do you recall? 
22 A It was two swabs for the entire area. 
23 They weren't separated. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: So you didn't swab the 
25 collar and the left side separately?

This is Number 29. 
Uh-huh. And again, I did a close-up 
17 picture to get my information on them and then 
18 there's one taken from farther away, which is 
19 probably a little more helpful to see the item in 
20 its entirety. 
21 Q What did you do with this piece of, this 
22 item? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm showing Photo 30.

MS. WHIRLEY: Can you see it okay? 
Yeah, I can see it. I swabbed, again, 
3 take two swabs, swabbed this area. There was an 
4 area, I think it was in this location. This picture 
5 isn't perfect to see the blood stain, but I did not 
6 swab that area because swabbing that area you would 
7 get blood of whoever at the time. I didn't know 
8 whose it was. So for trace, since I'm trying to 
9 find if there was contact, so swabbed any of the non 
10 blood stained areas. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So there was blood stain 
12 on the pants? 
13 A Yes. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And you tested that for 
15 blood?

Okay. 
And that is the back side. 
That's the back of the shirt? 
The back of the shirt. 
Now, you mention swabbing non stained 
For possible trace. 
For possible trace. Why would you not 
9 swab the blood stain areas for trace? 
10 A Well, blood is -- contains a lot of DNA. 
11 And then also it was Michael Brown's shirt, which 
12 would have DNA from him wearing it too. So for me 
13 to try to swab bloody areas, it is just unlikely to 
14 actually get a trace profile from that because the 
15 blood would overwhelm everything. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have a question? 
17 I know 
18 you may not have known this, but I don't know at the 
19 time if Michael Brown was supposedly been in the

4 A Yes, uh-huh. In case, if there was, 
5 again, if Officer Wilson grabbed his shirt. 
6 Okay. 
7 A It was hard in this instant. The shirt 
8 was blood soaked. So I did, again, do the same 
9 thing for trace DNA. I took two swabs and just 
10 swabbed the non stained areas.

9 
10 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You are not going underarm 
11 here and the tail of shirt from another spot? 
12 A No. And again, for a trace, we are trying 
13 to collect as much DNA as possible. So by keeping 
14 it to two swabs, rather than separating it. If 
15 there was something to collect, would be more likely 
16 to collect it with less swabs than large quantity. 
17 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. And this one, 
18 which is Number 33, what did that represent?

1 farther away so you can see the whole item. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I just go back really 
3 quickly. 
4 The apparent skin, or hardened nasal mucus 
5 that you looked at, did you swab that and forward 
6 the swabs to the DNA section, or did you forward the 
7 whole piece you said of whatever it was. 
8 A The whole piece did go, but I took a 
9 cutting of it. What we do with either the swabs in 
10 this case, that little piece, I would have sampled a 
11 section and put it in a tube and that's what DNA 
12 would actually test. And the remainder of that 
13 section I took approximately 4 millimeters by 3 
14 millimeters, and that's what actually the DNA unit 
15 would actually test. 
16 The rest of that, the remainder also 
17 went to DNA in case they need to do further testing. 
18 Same thing would happen with the 
19 swab. Like those two swabs that I took for trace, I 
20 sampled half of each swab, put that in a tube and 
21 that's what DNA you would be testing. And then the 
22 remainder of those swabs would be put in a container 
23 and they would be transported together. Does that 
24 make sense? 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes, I think so. So the

1 apparent skin or hardened nasal mucus, did you do 
2 any testing on that yourself other than to take a 
3 swab, take the piece out of it? 
4 A I tested it for blood, and then I did a 
5 test to confirm blood and determine probable 
6 species. What that means, this test is called 
7 Hemastix. What it does is that if it's positive, it 
8 confirms that it is blood and it is also presumptive 
9 for human species. And the reason why we can't say, 
10 oh, it is human blood for sure is that there are 
11 some other primates and ferrets blood that will --
12 
13 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Ferrets? 
Ferrets, yeah. I don't know why. That 
14 have reported given positive results. So in that 
15 case, the way we report it on my report is that for 
16 Q11, that examination discloses presence of blood as 
17 probably human organ. 
18 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. For this item as 
19 Q7; is that correct?

A 
Q 
It's Q1. 
Q1. That's what threw me off because I'm 
22 looking at the report, still looks like a seven to 
23 me, I don't know if anybody else thought that or 
24 that's just me. But that's actually Q1?

2 Q I'm glad you clarified that. So Q1 is 
3 the, because it was not corresponding with the 
4 report, that's why I was a little confused, but now

That's the back of the shorts. Just 
12 zooming in and focusing, but these are the back of 
13 the shorts. Do you know what kind of stain that is 
14 on the back, did you test that? 
15 A I tested overall for blood. I confirmed 
16 blood. I don't confirm each stain.

That is the front of the shorts, and if 
10 you look in this area that I've marked off, this is 
11 the area that I actually tested for blood. Again, 
12 we don't test every single stain. And then this 
13 little plus-plus is just my personal markings for, I 
14 did a presumptive testing and confirmatory test.

1 bleeder, would you have maybe tested more areas of 
2 the pants. 
3 A They could have been tested in that 
4 situation. That is where actual cuttings would have 
5 been taken from different areas to be tested for 
6 DNA. The only things that was tested for DNA, and 
7 this was for trace, again, on the nonstained areas. 
8 Q (By Ms. Whirley) You checked nonstained 
9 areas on these shorts too? 
10 A Yes. So again, areas that were not 
11 stained did the same thing, two swabs. 
12 Q Did you know if there was anything in the 
13 pockets or is that something that you would not deal 
14 with?
