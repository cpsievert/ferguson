1 Q Did you park right, like right around 
2 here? 
3 A Yes, that's where I parked. 
4 Q Okay. And then you walked through the 
5 grass? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Now, you said that Michael Brown was 
8 running in this direction, correct? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So that is down Canfield Drive, and he is 
11 running towards Copper Creek Court, this is Copper 
12

14 
15 
16 
Creek Court right here? (indicating) 
A Yes, he never made it that far. 
Q You said he never made it this far? 
A Yes. 
Q Which is, I've got the laser pointer, 
17 right on the corner of Canfield Drive and Copper 
18 Creek Court, he never made it that far? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yeah. 
And so you say that at the location where 
21 he ended coming, you know, came to rest, his body 
22 was in the street? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Urn, how much distance farther had he run 
25 before he fell down into the street, do you know

1 what I'm saying? So he runs and then he turns 
2 around? 
3 A Uh-huh. 
4 Q And does he take any steps or come towards 
5 the officer at all? 
6 A Whenever he stopped and turned around at, 
7 that's where he fell dead at. 
8 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
I didn't see him take any more steps. 
Let me ask you this, is it possible as you 
11 were trying to make your way in this direction and 
12 watching what was going on, you could have missed 
13 him being close to this corner to where he would 
14 have come 20 feet back toward the officer? 
15 A No, I can't. So whenever I was over this 
16 way, I saw him running past here, but for me to come 
17 across here and him to come all the way, that's not 
18 enough time I don't think. I didn't see him go that 
19 far, not at all. Because whenever I came across 
20 this, whenever I saw the officer coming this way and 
21 he was still coming right there, so he never made it 
22 that far. 
23 Q Okay. So let me tell you something, go 
24 ahead and sit down. So as you park your car, do you 
25 recall which slot you were in right here?

I was in one of those three, I can't 
10 remember exactly where I parked. 
11 Q From where you were parking and you have 
12 to get out of your car, is it possible that you lose 
13 sight of him for a time period or that you can't see 
14 from your location to where he could have been at 
15 that corner? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. So let me ask you this, have you 
18 been out on that street since then? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
No, I don't. 
Okay. Since then you haven't seen the 
21 flowers and memorial? 
22 A I seen pictures in the news and stuff like 
23 that, not myself actually being there, no. 
24 Q Do you have any reason to know why Michael 
25 Brown's blood might have been located in this area?

Okay. So is there, is it possible that, 
18 you know, you trying to run through the grass or get 
19 in this direction, you missed a part of that? 
20 A I can't see me missing that part because 
21 whenever I was coming across, I still had sight of 
22 them. I didn't see him go that far. 
23 Q Okay. But you say you saw him turn 
24 around? 
25 A Yes.

2 Q Okay. How about his head, did you ever 
3 see his head in the window? 
4 A I saw his head in the window, but not like 
5 kneel down into the window kind of thing, it was 
6 like kind of pulled back and forth like at the 
7 window. 
8 Q So Michael Brown, do you know how tall he 
9 was? 
10 A No, he's really tall though, he was a man

A 
Q 
There was a pause. 
Okay. So Michael Brown, does the pause 
4 happen when he turns around or before or after? 
5 A Like during the time, I can't say exactly 
6 when the pause happened because there were several 
7 pauses. I can't say this happened and then a pause, 
8 this happened and then a pause, I wasn't paying 
9 attention like when the gunshots came and when it 
10 stopped. 
11 Q Okay. And I know, it is tough, I mean, 
12 this is all very chaotic, and you're seeing

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME VII 
MS. WHIRLEY: Good morning. 
(Everybody says good morning.) 
MS. WHIRLEY: I'm Sheila Whirley. Of

5 course, Kathi Alizadeh is here, 12 grand jurors is 
6 here, and the court reporter. Today is September 
7 the 25th, Thursday. And I don't have the total 
8 program memorized for this morning or for today. I 
9 can tell you our first witness is 
10 , we heard his taped 
11 statements last time we were here, recorded 
12 statements with the police, with the FBI agent, and 
13 also made several appearances on the media for CNN, 
14 and I think various TV channels. You guys remember 
15 that, he is going to testify live here this morning. 
16 And then, Kathi, could you tell us what 
17 else is on the agenda today? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't know. No, 
19 actually, we have a witness scheduled for 10:30. He 
20 called me bright and early this morning to cancel, 
21 so we're going to probably play you, I don't think 
22 Witness Number 10, remember the guy that was 
23 He has a recorded statement 
24 I don't think I played. 
25 MS. WHIRLEY: Only played part of it. We

1 had about ten minutes left. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We can play the end of that 
3 to finish that and then we also have, you all heard 
4 from last time and she has media 
5 interviews that take, I think, about 33 minutes 
6 total for all of her media interviews. And then she 
7 also has some recorded statements that we can play 
8 and hopefully, that will fill out the morning. 
9 And then in the afternoon we have a 
10 witness scheduled to be here at 12:30. I will check 
11 and make sure he hasn't called to cancel during a 
12 break or whatever, hopefully then we will have 
13 another witness here in the afternoon. He also has 
14 a taped statement. I can't remember if it is 30 
15 minutes or an hour, it doesn't exceed an hour. 
16 So if he, you know, shows up, we can play 
17 his statement and then have him testify, and I think 
18 we are trying to recess 2:30. 
19 3:15. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: At the lunch break, if we 
21 need to figure out how to fill our time, we'll do 
22 that. 
23 Also, if you recall, Witness Number 10 had 
24 talked about the fact that he is,

6 It is not a very long
