6 A That's correct. 
7 Q Okay. How about Q18? 
8 A Sure. Q18 was the interior left front 
9 door handle of the vehicle. The DNA typing results 
10 obtained from Q18 are consistent with being a 
11 mixture of two or more individuals. This profile 
12 can be separated into a major male contributor 
13 profile and one or more minor contributors. Michael 
14 Brown is the source of the major male contributor 
15 profile. Due to the limited genetic information 
16 available from the minor component, the presence or 
17 absence from PO Wilson cannot be determined. 
18 Q Okay. And then again, what we've talked 
19 about so far with Michael Brown is the source of the 
20 major male contributor, or even part of a mixture, 
21 can you tell us whether it was blood or saliva or?

Assuming she was able to confirm it. 
MS. ALIZADEH: That's what I was going to 
13 say. Do you know if it was presumptive? 
14 A I believe on this item it was presumptive, 
15 I don't believe there was enough there to do the 
16 confirmatory test. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: You do have enough to get a 
18 DNA profile, you did get a DNA profile from the 
19 weapon?

Yes. 
(By Ms. Whirley) You can't say again

Q So tell us about the weapon. 1 
2 A Okay. The DNA testing results obtained 
3 from Q19 are consistent with being a mixture of 
4 three or more individuals. This profile can be 
5 separated into a major mixture of two individuals 
6 with a trace contributor. Again, the trace 
7 contributor is inconclusive. Michael Brown and PO 
8 Wilson are included as contributors to this major 
9 mixture profile. 
10 The observed major mixture profile is 
11 2.1 octillion times more likely if it originated 
12 from Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it 
13 originated from PO Wilson and an unknown individual 
14 in the general unrelated population. 
15 Q And again, we're talking about a number so 
16 high, you know, as many, many, many more times than 
17 the population of the whole world before you find 
18 another profile like this? 
19 A Well, this is actually the likelihood 
20 ratio statistic, so it is a little bit different on 
21 the assumptions, but that hypothesis has very, very, 
22 strong support. 
23 Q Okay, all right. And this is, I don't 
24 know if you have some different numbers somewhere 
25 else. This is a pretty important part of what they

1 need to know, the DNA on the gun. So what can you 
2 tell us about the DNA on the gun again? 
3 A The hypothesis that it's these two 
4 individuals, PO Wilson and Michael Brown, is 2.1 
5 octillion times more likely than it was PO Wilson 
6 and some unknown. 
7 Q When you say hypothesis, what do you mean? 
8 A Basically it's just how well that 
9 hypothesis explains the data. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
What does hypothesis mean? 
Hypothesis would be that supposing that 
12 these two particular individuals contributed it 
13 versus another individual and PO Wilson. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: Questions on that? 
16 Let me understand this, 
17 So are you saying his DNA was on 
18 the gun? 
19 A That statement is supported by the data, 
20 yes. 
21 You can't 
22 determine if it was from skin cells or fluid? 
23 A Correct. The DNA profile would be the 
24 same throughout your body, so we're not able to 
25 determine if the DNA profile originated from blood

1 or skin cells. 
2 Yes. 
3 You talked 
4 about the door, the front door handle? 
5 A Yes. 
6 You could tell it was 
7 Michael Brown? 
8 
9 
A Yes. 
He was the more major 
10 contributor. So if he was the last person to touch 
11 it, would his DNA, would it have overrode whoever 
12 touched it prior? 
13 A It's possible, yes. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) There's evidence that, or 
15 information that, and you probably know this 
16 already, you get some information from the police 
17 when you are doing this testing, correct?

Q 
A 
Q 
Some. 
There was a shooting involved in the car? 
Yes. 
And then there was blood and actually some 
22 blood swabs were submitted, correct? 
23 A Yes, and I believe at the time of the 
24 testing, I don't know that I actually knew of a 
25 shooting.

Q

But you know now before I told you? 
I do know now. 
So if his DNA is on the gun and the car 
4 and the door of the car, there's no way you can tell 
5 us is it because he touched the gun or because his 
6 blood may have been on there or some other portion, 
7 sweat or saliva, probably not saliva, but some other 
8 bodily fluids, you can't tell us exactly how his DNA 
9 got on that gun? 
10 
11 
12 
A That's correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Any questions on that? 
I do, I just 
13 have a question about Number 11, 12, 13 and 14. It 
14 says apparent tissue or hardened nasal mucus from 
15 vehicle 108. And it says apparent tissue or 
16 hardened nasal mucus

19 We don't know what it is. If you can answer any 
20 more, was the suggestion that it was a hardened 
21 nasal mucus just an assumption because it looked 
22 that way?

4 MS. ALIZADEH: It's been tested.

3 component. And again, the trace component is 
4 inconclusive. 
5

7 
A 
Q

The trace component is inconclusive. 
(By Ms. Whirley) So that's that person 
8 other than Michael Brown and PO Wilson? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay, go ahead. 
Michael Brown and PO Wilson are included 
12 as contributors to this major mixture profile. The 
13 observed major mixture profile is 2.1 trillion times 
14 more like that it originated from Michael Brown and 
15 PO Wilson, than if it originated from PO Wilson and 
16 an unknown individual in the general unrelated 
17 population. 
18 Q Okay. So again, we don't know how his DNA 
19 got on his shirt? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. Questions on that one? 
Q21-1. 
23 A This was PO Wilson's uniform pants on the 
24 left side. The DNA typing results are consistent 
25 with being a mixture of three or more individuals.

1 This profile can be separated into a major mixture 
2 of two individuals with a trace component, and the 
3 trace component is inconclusive. 
4 Michael Brown and PO Wilson are 
5 included as contributors to this major mixture 
6 profile. The observed major mixture profile is 34 
7 sextillion times more likely it originated from 
8 Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it originated 
9 from PO Wilson and an unknown individual in the 
10 general unrelated population. 
11 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Q 
So those are on the pants? 
Yes. 
Now, we started with Q5 and we talked 
14 about things of evidentiary value. K1-1 is Michael 
15 Brown's shirt, and you did not consider that to be 
16 of evidentiary value because it said that Wilson is 
17 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile? 
18 A Well, I started with samples that I 
19 performed statistical measures on and when we do 
20 exclusions, there is no statistical measure. 
21 can certainly get those results now. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. Go ahead. 
So Q1-1 was Michael Brown's T-shirt. 
So I 
I 
24 believe this is where attempted to swab areas 
25 that did not appear to have blood staining. The DNA

1 typing results obtained from Q1-1 are consistent 
2 with being a mixture of two or more individuals. 
3 This profile can be separated into a major component 
4 profile consistent with Michael Brown and one or 
5 more trace contributors. 
6 And then, again, there's limited 
7 genetic information from the trace component, so 
8 inclusionary statements can be made regarding this 
9 portion of the mixture. 
10 However, PO Wilson is excluded as a 
11 contributor to this mixture profile. 
12 Q So that means whatever the trace component 
13 was did not have any of the alleles or any of the 
14 profile of Officer Wilson? 
15 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
So Q2-1? 
This was Michael Brown's shorts. The DNA 
18 typing results obtained from Q2-1 are consistent 
19 with being a mixture of three or more individuals. 
20 This profile can be separated into a major component 
21 profile consistent with Michael Brown and two or 
22 more trace contributors. Due to the limited genetic 
23 information available from the trace component of 
24 the mixture, no inclusionary statements will be made 
25 regarding the trace component. PO Wilson is

1 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile. 
2 Q So to say the thing that we said earlier, 
3 none of those little points or the alleles match 
4 Officer Wilson? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
If one of two would have matched, you 
7 would have said what? 
A It is possible that maybe one or two did, 8 
9 but overall he was excluded. So if you have one or 
10 two, it's possible you just might have adventitious 
11 inclusion, I guess, because people do share alleles, 
12 they share peaks, but when you look across an entire 
13 profile, that's how when you are able to determine 
14 if they are excluded or not. 
15 Q Do you use a certain number of peaks or 
16 alleles to make an exclusion? 
17 A There is really not a specific number, it 
18 is just dependent on the mixture. But again, if 
19 there are peaks that are foreign to the individual 
20 then they're excluded. 
21 Q So in this case, is that what we are 
22 seeing is that they were foreign to Officer Wilson? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A

Yes. 
The trace amounts, those alleles? 
Yes.

1 Q Anything else of evidentiary value that we 
2 missed? 
3 A I think the only other items that we have 
4 discussed would be the swabs from Michael Brown's 
5 other portions of his body, his hands. 
6 Q Okay. We'll talk about that. Is there a 
7 question? 
8 So on Q1-1, the 
9 report talks about possible Police Officer Wilson 
10 grabbed the shirt of Michael Brown, from what you 
11 seen from the area that was tested, you didn't get 
12 enough markers to verify that that's true. From 
13 what you've seen you didn't get any police officer's 
14 DNA off of that shirt? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Anyone else? Okay. 
17 On that other report, which is Grand 
18 Jury Exhibit Number 74, was there, tell us about 
19 that, what you concluded in that analysis. 
20 A The second report consisted of additional 
21 items that I was requested to process. There was 
22 Cardinals baseball hat, two Nike sandals, the right 
23 and the left. Actually, there was, yes, there was 
24 two sandals and there were two swabs taken from each 
25 of those sandals. So there's four swabs from the

1 sandals. And there were also two bracelets, one of 
2 them was a black, yellow and white rubber bracelet, 
3 and the other one was a dark brown beaded bracelet. 
4 Q Were you able to, I see where you have the 
5 buccal swab referenced for Officer Wilson and the 
6 blood referenced for Michael Brown. Were you able 
7 to find any profiles on those bracelets? 
8 A I was able to obtain a mixture on each 
9 one. You want me to 
10 Q Yes, please. 
11 A So on the black, yellow and white rubber 
12 band bracelet, the DNA typing results obtained from 
13 that item Q25-1, are consistent with being a mixture 
14 of two or more individuals. This profile can be 
15 separated into a major male component profile and 
16 one or more minor contributors. Due to the limited 
17 genetic information available from the minor 
18 component of the mixture, no inclusionary statements 
19 will be made regarding the minor component. Michael 
20 Brown and PO Wilson are excluded as contributors of 
21 the major male component profile, however, I 
22 couldn't determine if they were present as possible 
23 minor contributors. 
24 Q There wasn't enough of a DNA profile to 
25 make the connection?

Page 193 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q Okay. That's for the yellow and black, 
3 yellow and white rubber bracelet. And then the dark 
4 brown bracelet, did the same determination? 
5 A It was essentially the same. On this 
6 particular item there was a mixture of three or four 
7 individuals instead of a mixture of two or more, but 
8 again, there was a major male component profile and 
9 then two or more minor contributors, but they were 
10 excluded as the major contributor. 
11 Q Then going to the first page, the 
12 Cardinals baseball cap. 
13 A That profile was single source. Michael 
14 Brown was the source of that DNA profile. And then 
15 Q24-1 was the reddish brown stain on the right Nike 
16 sandal, that was also Michael Brown. 
17 Q Okay. When you say single source, you 
18 mean no mixture, just straight one source? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Does that pretty much conclude that second 
21 supplemental report? 
22 A The only other item would be swabs from, 
23 again, the second set of swabs from the left and 
24 right sandals and those results were inconclusive, 
25 so I wasn't able to do any conclusions on them.

5 Did you 
6 do anything with the clippings of the fingernails?

14 fingernail scrapings. This was a mixture, so again, 
15 this is Q9-1. It was consistent with being a 
16 mixture of three or more individuals. This profile 
17 can be separated into a major component profile 
18 consistent with Michael Brown and two or more trace 
19 contributors. Due to the limited genetic 
20 information available from the trace component of 
21 the mixture, no inclusionary statements will be made

24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

And then Q10 was a single source profile

1 and it was consistent with Michael Brown. 
2 Q6 and Q8 
3 backs of Michael Brown's hands, looks like there's 
4 no Officer Wilson's DNA on the backs of his hands? 
5 A That's correct, it is a single source 
6 profile consistent with Michael Brown. 
7 We had heard that Michael 
8 Brown was punching the officer in the face. Would 
9 you say that's inconsistent with those reports? 
10 A Well, on these particular items, it has 
11 RBS after it, reddish brown stain. So it is 
12 possible that PO Wilson isn't there, it's also 
13 possible he is not being detected due to the blood 
14 on the hand. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you this also. 
16 When it says that the backs of the hands were 
17 swabbed, and I guess we would have to talk to 
18 whoever swabbed them, we don't know if that includes 
19 the knuckles or back of the hand? 
20 
21

23 was swabbed, correct?

4 you did not have a known sample from a Dorian 
5 Johnson, did you? 
6 A No, I did not. 
7 Back to Michael 
8 Brown. I guess is it safe to say that the areas 
9 that would have been in contact with PO Officer 
10 Darren Wilson, like neck, shoulders, was not swabbed 
11 due to the blood? 
12 
13 
A I believe that's correct, yes. 
I'm confused

15 shirt, from Michael Brown, correct? 
16 A On PO Wilson's shirt. 
17 He was talking about 
18 Michael Brown's shirt, which is my original 
19 question. You said that just because you weren't 
20 able to get Officer Wilson's DNA on his fist, on his 
21 hand, it could have been overwhelmed by the blood 
22 that was there?

2 MS. WHIRLEY: Did he have blood on his 
3 hands, is that what you are talking about? 
4 A Yes, the swabs, it looks like Q5, I have 
5 RBS listed. So there was blood detected there as 
6 well, Q6, Q7 and Q8. 
7 He had 
8 blood on both left and right hand? 
9 A Yes, that's how it appears in my report, 
10 yes. 
11 (sic) 
12 Back to Q25 and 26, something the prosecutor brought 
13 up. If you had DNA samples, would you have enough 
14 markers to compare it to known DNA? 
15 A From the major component, yes. 
16 The 
17 fingernail clippings and scrapings, were they 
18 separate, did they scrape them and also clip them, 
19 or was it just the clippings? And if it was just 
20 the clippings, could that have been, have 
21 deteriorated DNA? 
22 A Urn, I'm not aware of how they're 
23 collected. I think the medical examiner would have 
24 to speak to that.

A That they were clippings. 1 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: And that she swabbed the 
3 clippings. 
4 A Right, because what I received is just a 
5 portion of the original item. So I just get a 
6 little tube with something inside, so I don't know. 
7 In the 
8 report it says here that the contributors not 
9 identify, were unable to identify that, the example 
10 is put it in CODIS; is that correct, is that my 
11 understanding? 
12 A Yes, at the very end there are two samples 
13 that were entered into CODIS. 
14 Do they stay in CODIS for 
15 a specific amount of time or just in case somebody 
16 might pop up? 
17 A So just a little bit of background on 
18 CODIS. There is actually three levels of CODIS. 
19 There's a local level, state level and national 
20 level. So the national level is the most 
21 restrictive. There's a number of rules about what 
22 can go in. It has to be something from the scene of 
23 a crime. It cannot be from the victim, it cannot be 
24 from a witness in the crime, for example. But as 
25 you move down to the local levels it gets less

1 restrictive. 
2 So, for example, all the analyst 
3 profiles are in our local database. Any reference 
4 standard from the list of the suspect is entered 
5 locally. 
6 The Missouri State Attorney General 
7 has made a ruling at the state level we can maintain 
8 those suspect profiles. So we enter the suspect 
9 known at our level and it stays at the state level. 
10 It does not move to the national level. 
11 Any unknown sample, we call it a case 
12 work unknown sample. And this example of Q12, which 
13 was consistent with Michael Brown, and I believe 
14 that was from the vehicle. That was entered into 
15 CODIS and that would go to the national level. 
16 I want to go 
17 back to Q1-1, Michael Brown's T-shirt again to make 
18 sure I'm clear. The last line says PO Wilson is 
19 excluded as a contributor to this mixture profile. 
20 So that tells he is not part of whatever stain is on 
21 that shirt. 
22 A He was not detected, that's correct. 
23 And they also swabbed some 
24 of the non stained areas of that shirt and did not 
25 find any DNA in that area either?

1 A I believe Q1-1 was from the non stained 
2 areas. 
3 Okay. 
4 A She did not swab the stained areas 
5 because, again, we would expect to find Michael 
6 Brown's blood. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: And that's pretty much 
8 protocol or standard not to swab an area that is 
9 bloody like that, just too much and the person who 
10 bled? 
11 A Right, and DNA testing is expensive and 
12 time consuming so we try to restrict the number of 
13 samples to something that can provide information in 
14 the case. 
15 Q There's just no way to know until it was 
16 requested? 
17 A Right. 
18 Q So what do you do after you complete your 
19 analysis, what do you do with all this stuff? 
20 A All the samples, in this particular case 
21 for a time, I believe, the FBI were intentionally 
22 going to take it and place it in a vault in 
23 preparation for them to take. The particular items 
24 that I tested, I don't believe they ended up taking. 
25 So we boxed them up for long-term storage.

You have custody of them? 
They're in the laboratory, yes. 
Do you know what items the FBI did test 
4 and they took the items that you tested, is that 
5 what you said? 
6 A They informed me that they don't repeat 
7 something that has already been done, so they would 
8 do testing in addition to what our laboratory 
9 performs. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
So I don't know that. 
I'm not aware that they retested anything 
12 that I tested. 
13 Q And you don't know what they did test? 
14 A No. 
15 Q Okay. Here is a question I guess you 
16 posed for me, do you keep items, why do you keep the 
17 items for? 
A The cuttings and all of the envelopes and 18 
19 things that would have taken. We do retain it 
20 for possible defense retesting. So we try not to 
21 consume any samples. And if we do have to consume a 
22 sample, we have to obtain permission from the 
23 prosecutor's office or whoever maybe if there is a 
24 suspect in the case.

1 how you insure that your work is accurate, you said 
2 there is a technical review or someone reviews your 
3 work? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q They don't retest, Kathi already asked, 
6 they just review what you have done? 
7 A That's correct. 
Q Steps that you have taken? 8 
9 A Right, and they double check all the math 
10 and any calculations that were done. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: All right. Questions, 
12 Kathi? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: No. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else? Okay. I

1 anything to do with the monitoring of radio traffic 
2 in St. Louis County? 
3 A I did, and I still have access because it 
4 helps me troubleshoot a lot of things. 
5 Q Okay. And so we've already heard 
6 testimony so we're not going to need a detailed 
7 description, but you, of course, you are familiar 
8 with the RIOT channels that St. Louis County has?

12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And how many RIOT channels are there? 
I believe there's four. 
And they are A, B, C and D then? 
Right. 
And so we have already again heard talk 
15 about what they are and how they work and when 
16 they're in use. 
17 But when transmissions are received 
18 on the RIOT channel in the communication center, are 
19 those transmissions recorded? 
20 A Yes, if they're actually heard they would 
21 be recorded. 
22 Q Okay. So there's an audio recording of 
23 transmissions, correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Is there also a record that's made that

1 that transmission is actually received so there 
2 would be a date stamp, a time stamp with each 
3 transmission that's heard? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Okay. And were you asked during the 
6 course of the investigation into the shooting of 
7 Michael Brown, were you aware that there was some 
8 issue about whether or not a call was made on a RIOT 
9 channel? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Not until you had asked. 
Okay. So, and let's go back on August 9th 
12 of 2014, were you, do you recall that and were you 
13 aware that there was an incident that occurred down 
14 in South County at the St. Anthony's Hospital in one 
15 of their hospice care facilities? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And were you aware that there were a 
18 number of officers and County TAC responded, they 
19 had a staging area and so forth; is that correct?

Q 
Yes.
