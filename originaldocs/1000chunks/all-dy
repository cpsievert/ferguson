19 actually not see that? 
20 I didn't see exactly where

13 Okay. And you say that 
14 Michael Brown had his hand in the air at the time he 
15 was shot? 
16 Yes. 
17 Did he say anything? 
18 Please, don't shoot. 
19 Okay. And did you actually 
20 hear that? 
21 Yes. 
22 You said he was pleading for 
23 his life? 
24 Yes. 
25 And the police officer shot

1 him in the head? 
2 Yes. 
3 I think you described before 
4 that the police officer was basically standing right 
5 in front of him when he shot him; is that right? 
6 Yes, his gun was close to 
7 him. 
8 His gun almost touching his 
9 head? 
10 Not almost touching, I said 
11 like that far away, but it was point blank range. 
12 (inaudible) 
13 You've described it as very 
14 close or point blank range? 
15 Point blank range. 
16 Basically the police 
17 officer, from what you described before, he just got 
18 out of his car and walked over to Mike Brown and 
19 shot him in the head? 
20 I didn't see any of it. 
21 You didn't see the police 
22 officer get out of the car? 
23 I didn't see it. 
24 Okay. You've described on 
25 August 13th that the officer got out of the car and

3 That's why we are here today. 
4 We're trying to determine 
5 exactly what you saw, okay. 
6 Uh-huh. 
7 But basically you said 
8 before that the officer shot Brown in the head as 
9 soon as he exited the police truck. You saying 
10 today you didn't see the police officer exit the 
11 truck? 
12 I didn't see him get out of 
13 no truck. His police cruiser was a couple of feet 
14 going up towards West Florissant. 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 But I didn't see him get out 
17 of no truck. 
18 Okay. So when you looked 
19 out there on August 9th, the police officer is 
20 already out of the truck? 
21 Yes. 
22 And was standing in front of 
23 Mike Brown? 
24 Yes. 
25 And then he shoots him once

1 in the head? 
2 Yeah. 
3 While Mike Brown was 
4 pleading, please don't shoot me. 
5 Yeah. 
6 Again, the officer is very 
7 close, basically point blank range at the time of 
8 the shot? 
9 Yes. 
10 I think you said before too 
11 they were basically right next to the police car at 
12 that time the; is that right? 
13 It was not right next, but 
14 it was enough to where I could see the police 
15 cruiser. 
16 I think before you said it 
17 was probably five or six feet away? 
18 Yeah, It wasn't too far, it 
19 was down toward like West Florissant. 
20 He was actually moving; is 
21 that right? 
22 Yeah, he was moving, he was 
23 facing towards West Florissant. 
24 At the time that the police 
25 officer shot Mike Brown in the head and he fell,

1 they were about five or six feet away from the 
2 police car? 
3 Yeah. 
4 Okay. And you say today 
5 that Mr. Brown, when he was shot in the head, he 
6 dropped to the ground flat on his face? 
7 Yeah. 
8 Basically facedown? 
9 Basically, yeah. 
10 Do you recall on 
11 August 13th, it is another concern I have okay, and 
12 I'm just being honest with you, okay? 
13 All right. 
14 Is it at that time you said 
15 you he fell on his side. You said he fell on his 
16 side and the police officer shot him four more times 
17 in the side. 
18 That's what I heard. 
19 Okay. Who did you hear that 
20 from? 
21 Somebody in my complex. 
22 Okay. Those people were 
23 just telling you that? 
24 Yes, there was a whole bunch 
25 of people outside, so it is a whole bunch of

1 stories. But I will tell you from what I seen, from 
2 what I seen, what I seen he dropped and I heard more 
3 shots as I was going downstairs. 
4 So basically you didn't see 
5 Michael Brown when he turned or dropped to the 
6 ground, you didn't see him turn on his side? 
7 
8 
9 
No. 
You didn't see that? 
No. When I got down to the 
10 end of the steps, he was facedown. 
11 Okay. All right. So you 
12 never saw him turned on his side? 
13 No, when I got down he was 
14 facedown and blood was rushing from his head out in 
15 the street. 
16 And just to be clear here, 
17 then you didn't see the police officer stand over 
18 him and fire four more shots into his body? 
19 Obviously, I didn't see him, 
20 I heard eight more shots after the two gunshots from 
21 inside the house. 
22 Let me ask you this 
23 and again, I just want to be upfront here. Are you 
24 sure that you saw the police officer fire any shots 
25 as oppose to just hearing shots?

1 Yes, I saw him. 
2 You saw one shot? 
3 The one to the head that 
4 killed him. 
5 You actually witnessed that? 
6 Yes. 
7 That's not just something 
8 that someone told you? 
9 No, I actually seen it. 
10 Because my issue is and 
11 coming into today, before you were even telling me 
12 some things different from before, and I understand. 
13 Some of the things you heard you saw before you 
14 actually just heard from other people; is that 
15 right? 
16 Yeah. 
17 Is that correct. 
18 Yeah. 
19 So you didn't actually see 
20 those things? 
21 No. 
22 Okay. I just want to make 
23 sure you are in here today and you are telling me 
24 you saw that one shot, I want to make sure that's 
25 just not what someone told you versus what you

1 actually saw, because now is your opportunity, okay? 
2 Okay. 
3 You can see our concern, right, 
4 because beforehand you told us what you saw that you 
5 saw and now you came in here and say you actually 
6 heard it, you said that initially. We need to be 
7 sure, you know, if we are going to put a case 
8 together and put you on the witness stand, we need 
9 to be sure that you are telling us what you actually 
10 saw versus what you heard from people on the street. 
11 You understand? 
12 Yeah. 
13 So, I mean, now is your 
14 opportunity, okay? 
15 I'm telling you I just told 
16 you everything. 
17 You said you heard two shots 
18 inside the house and you came out 
19 And heard eight more, yes. 
20 Okay. But as said, 
21 what we are trying to do is evaluate witnesses here 
22 and evaluate this case, okay. And I can tell you at 
23 this point if we were going to charge this case and 
24 go to trial there is just no way I could put you on 
25 the witness stand and there's a couple reasons for

1 that, okay. 
2 The first is, basically just about 
3 everything that you said on August 13th, and much of 
4 what you said today isn't consistent with the 
5 physical evidence that we have in this case, okay. 
6 And now what you are telling us today is 
7 actually substantially less detailed than what you 
8 said on August 13th and I understand that and we 
9 talked about it, all right. But then also what you 
10 told us today is quite a bit different from what you 
11 said on August 3rd. So those are the issues we 
12 have, okay. 
13 What you are telling me today or on 
14 August 13th is not consistent with the physical 
15 evidence we have, okay. Evidence that is not going 
16 to change, that's just not just someone else 
17 talking, okay. That's what the evidence is. 
18 And is talking about the 
19 evidence, he is talking about the scientific 
20 evidence and things like that, not what other people 
21 are saying. 
22 Right. I'm talking about 
23 DNA evidence, I'm talking about just simple things 
24 like the way the scene was laid out, right. What 
25 you're telling me, it is just not consistent with

1 what happened that day. All right. And that's our 
2 concern, you understand? 
3 Yes. 
4 I mean, can you explain that 
5 to me? 
6 I want to know if you say 
7 from a different perspective, why would you ask the 
8 witness everybody's perspective wouldn't be the same 
9 because there is different angles. 
10 Exactly, that's why I'm 
11 saying. 
12 (Inaudible) 
13 I'm not saying other people 
14 are saying other things you must be lying here, 
15 that's not what I'm saying. What I'm telling you is 
16 not from someone else's perspective, okay, or what 
17 another witness said. I'm talking about actual 
18 physical, forensic evidence at the scene, okay. 
19 So what am I saying that 
20 don't match up? 
21 That's what you need to tell 
22 me. 
23 There's no telling you. 
24 That's what I'm wondering 
25 is, can you explain to me why that's the case?

Again, I'm telling you what 
2 I saw. Not what you say, you know, I'm telling you 
3 what I saw from my perspective. That's why I have 
4 been brought down to tell you my perspective of 
5 what's going on. 
6 Well, and so you substantially 
7 changed, right, before you had a whole other 
8 narrative and now you are coming here and explain to 
9 us well, a lot of that is what people were telling 
10 you? 
11 Didn't you all just say let 
12 you know that we were outside to tell you what I 
13 seen and not heard. 
14 Right, exactly right. Before 
15 we came in here we said to you make sure you just 
16 that us what you saw and not what people said to 
17 you. 
18 And let me make it very 
19 clear about that, there is certain things that you 
20 said you saw back on August 13th, we're actually 
21 thinking 
22 That people told me, yes. 
23 , you know, (inaudible)

1 And honestly, you have never done this 
2 before, correct, you have never been before a court 
3 or anything like that? 
4 No. 
5 Would you lie if you didn't 
6 see Michael Brown shot if you didn't, would you lie 
7 about that? 
8 No. 
9 That's all well and good, 
10 okay, that's fine. But the point is that on 
11 August 13th you told the police, you told the FBI 
12 things like you saw the police officer after that 
13 first shot to the head. The shot that you saw, the 
14 first shot you saw to the head that Michael Brown 
15 fell to the ground on his side and the police 
16 officer stood over him and fired four more shots 
17 into his body. You said that you saw that, okay. 
18 Now today, to your credit, you've told us 
19 no, that's not what I saw, that's just something 
20 that I heard, but you understand that you told the 
21 FBI that back on August 13th that you saw it.

23 what I heard, I'm telling you about how I was going
