5 MS. ALIZADEH: We're back on the record

7 Witness Number 46 needed to kind of have a break to 
8 collect herself. And she has asked if me could she 
9 come in here and try to finish explaining what she 
10 saw. So rather than me ask you questions, I felt 
11 like maybe I was upsetting you. I'm going to let 
12 you just finish telling what you saw. And if they 
13 have questions, they can ask you, okay. This is 
14 their investigation and they will ask you questions 
15 if they need you to explain, okay.

18 don't you start from where you said the officer was, 
19 Michael Brown is moving away from the officer and 
20 the officer starts shooting and then you can pick 
21 up, that's kind of where we were and you can just 
22 finish or keep going from there, okay.

1 communicating mean I don't have anything, but he 
2 said it loud, not in a low tone voice, in a holler 
3 voice is I don't have anything. 
4 And the other young man, which is 
5 small ball, he was on the other side, but he was 
6 diagonally like a distance from like me and you. 
7 And the young man kept walking fast 
8 and the police had shot one shot, I don't know where 
9 it hit or what, because at that time I put my head 
10 down behind, you know, the wheel. I raised back up 
11 and the police just kept firing and the second shot, 
12 which I seen that hit the boy cause he jumped. I 
13 don't know where it hit him at, but it hit the boy. 
14 And the police just kept firing and saying something 
15 to the boy, and kept firing. The boy kept saying, I 
16 got, my hands is up, I don't have anything, what do 
17 you want. 
18 And next thing I know, I don't know 
19 where it hit, but when the boy fell, there was blood 
20 shot everywhere. 
21 And the police just stand over him 
22 and shot him like he playing darts at a board. At 
23 that time the police, the other boy was gone, not 
24 gone, but standing and off to the side. Mostly 
25 toward the passenger side of the street.

1 And when the policeman kept shooting 
2 at him like he's a dartboard, I got out of my car, 
3 and I went to the police I said, can I help the 
4 young man, can I please help him, he's bleeding. 
5 The police told me. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You can say the bad word. 
7 A The police told me, get the fuck away from 
8 over here. When he told me that, I turned around 
9 and I said, you ain't said nothing but a word. So I 
10 jump back in the car, this time I started panicking. 
11 So I pulled my car into the complex, 
12 I call my and I told her I just seen a 
13 boy got shot. For what, I said I don't know, I 
14 don't know, he's shot. He's in the street. She 
15 said what street, I said right on the side of your 
16 house, and they said they heard gunshot, so 
17 everybody started coming outside. 
18 By this time a young man, I don't 
19 know who he is, gave me a cigarette. I haven't 
20 smoked a cigarette since I was young. I smoke now. 
21 I took the cigarette, I smoked it and then I asked 
22 for more cigarettes, the guy gave me three 
23 cigarettes. I smoked it, I walked back up there,

1 people, and this is before they put that orange tape 
2 around or yellow tape around, and I asked, I said 
3 what is going on here. Everybody was hollering and 
4 stuff, everybody was crying this, somebody said call 
5 the police, and one lady said that is the police. 
6 And the only thing I just remember 
7 from that that I was screaming and hollering, people 
8 was hugging me, I don't even know nobody out there 
9 besides my 
10 And I told them, like I told Kathi 
11 and the other lady, if I could have saved him, 
12 because , I thought I could save him, I 
13 wanted to save him, not because he was bleeding, 
14 because any time, say for instance if you look at, 
15 what if that's your child laying on that ground. 
16 What if that's your daughter laying up there that 
17 the police shot. What would you do. Would you sit 
18 there and see somebody else's child that I don't 
19 even know lay on the ground? 
20 Flashbacks went in my mind. That's 
21 my boy. I don't know these kids, but just think 
22 y'all, what if that's your boy. Picture your boy

14 could have done to save him. 
15 A I feel that maybe I could have stopped the
