3 A I looked away to grab my purse because I 
4 was looking for her car, but I noticed it was fine, 
5 but I was going to go outside and go to her, but I 
6 decided to not go outside because of gunshots 
7 outside my door. I grabbed my purse and head back 
8 to the windows.

18 pretty sure it was a black color. 
19 Q Okay. Why did that car draw your 
20 attention? 
21 A I saw somebody I recognized like crouching 
22 next to the car. It was, I call him DJ, it was 
23 Dorian Johnson. He was just crouching next to the 
24 car. I originally thought the police, he'd been

1 police just ran right past the car like not even

12 
Q 
A 
As you are looking down at whom? 
At Dorian and like he's right in front of 
13 me. So I'm looking kind of down when I see him. 
14 Q Do you know where the shots are coming 
15 from at this point? 
16 A I could tell that it was following the 
17 police, so the police was the one shooting the 
18 shots. It was like, my eyesight is coming from a 
19 car area at first and now it's coming from this way.

2 A Okay. As I'm glancing down and Dorian, I 
3 heard the gunshot as I notice the officer running 
4 past me. I just glimpse at the officer, I wasn't 
5 too much paying attention to him because I'm more 
6 thinking about what is going on next to this car. 
7 There is also people inside the car and it appears 
8 to me like Dorian was going to hop in it and just 
9 leave, but that never happened. 
10 I just have a glimpse, what I presume 
11 to be a kid, I don't know why I thought it was a 
12 kid, but he just looked young, you can tell somebody
