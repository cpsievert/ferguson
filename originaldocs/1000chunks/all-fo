10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So my question is in 
11 response to one of the questions of the grand 
12 jurors, were you paying attention to what the girl 
13 was doing the whole time, or was it that after it 
14 was over you looked there and she was still there? 
15 How do you know she stayed next to your van the 
16 whole time?

18 everything was getting ready to turn off, she was 
19 still standing by the side of my vehicle. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay.

MS. WHIRLEY: I want to make sure I heard 
20 clearly. When he turned around and charged the 
21 officer, he only moved two feet, two to three feet. 
22 A I'm not exactly sure how many feet it was, 
23 but I know for a fact that he was in front of this

7 MS. ALIZADEH: So you're saying he only 
8 moved a couple of feet, though, in that charge? 
9 A Well, yeah, because he didn't get far 
10 before the officer started firing because I wasn't 
11 going to, he didn't let anyone run up on him.

1 charging, he told him to stop like three times. 
2 Like two or three feet he got before they started 
3 shooting. He kept running. 
4 Okay. 
5 A Like the first few bullets didn't have any 
6 phase in it, he just kept running. 
7 So he didn't just go two 
8 or three feet, he went two or three feet when the 
9 officer started shooting? 
10 A Correct. 
11 again. 
12 Could you see, I guess in one of your transcripts, 
13 you said he shot him three times. Did he actually 
14 see him getting shot three times? 
15 A I don't know if it made contact. He fired 
16 his gun three times at first. 
17 Okay. 
18 A And then he said stop some more and he 
19 kept coming and then he fired the gun four more 
20 times. 
21 Could you demonstrate how 
22 he turned, or when he stopped and turned around and 
23 started coming back towards the officer?

2 towards the officer like this. (indicating) 
3 Okay. So he never did 
4 this? (indicting) 
5 A For a second it looked like he was going 
6 to put his hands up, but he brought it back down. 
7 When he charged the officer like that, that's when 
8 you heard the first three gunshots. 
9 I don't know where he, I guess the 
10 little thing on the fucking news where it had it in 
11 his hands. So that's where I assumed where it hit 
12 him. I did not see it hit him. 
13 You are saying he went 
14 like this and then like this? (Indicating) 
15 A Yeah, he kind of like, he thought about 
16 putting his hands up for a second. He just didn't 
17 do it. 
18 Is that when he proceeded 
19 to charge this officer? 
20 
21 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Let me make sure I'm 
22 clear. This is really an important part for a lot

1 A That's the point, it looked like he may 
2 have thought about it. Like he wanted to. 
3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So was he doing it? 
4 A No, he like, his hands were open at first, 
5 and it looked like his arms were going to start to 
6 go up. 
7 Q Did they go up at all? 
8 A He got like shoulder length like this and 
9 then he balled his hands up and then he went like, 
10 folder his arms in and started charging towards him. 
11 Q Okay. So you demonstrated that his hands 
12 were open and they went up shoulder length and then 
13 they came down and balled up?

15 Q And that's when you said he charged at the 
16 first two to three feet?

Steps, like footprints? 
Each step, to me a step is like two or

17 You characterize it as charge, could he 
18 have been staggering? 
19 A When he first started running, ma'am, he 
20 was not staggering. He was charging this officer 
21 and that's how I feel it was, like he was running 
22 towards him. If he had got close enough, I feel 
23 like he would have tackled him up against the car.

1 Q So they were near the cruiser when he came 
2 back? 
3 A He was coming this way going west towards 
4 this and the cruiser was here. He was running past 
5 this actual not too far behind the cruiser and was 
6 saying stop, stop, stop and that's when he started 
7 firing and the officer went this way instead of 
8 going back towards the cruiser, he came across the 
9 street this way. 
Q The officer did? 
A Yes. 
10 
11 
12 Q Okay. So the first shots, you felt he was 
13 charging him after the first shots, do you still 
14 feel he was charging?

16 still charging at him and then after the fourth 
17 shot, it looked like he was staggering.

1 was kind of like running like, like I said, like a 
2 football tackle, like he was going to tackle the 
3 officer. I couldn't really see the expression on 
4 his face. 
5 Okay. So it is not that 
6 you were too far to see it, it was just that you 
7 weren't at a good angle to see it?

other than that, 
13 I mean, do you feel like 
14 this could have ended up any other way?

19 weren't able to complete your testimony, so thank 
20 you for coming back today. 
21 What I want to start with, though, is 
22 that after your testimony on October 23rd. You and 
23 I had a phone conversation where I had called you 
24 because we were trying to figure out another date 
25 for you to come back, do you recall that?

17 health issues? 
18 A I'm bipolar. 
19 Q And do you take medication for that? 
20 A Urn, not for the bipolar, well, the 
21 medication that I take works both for migraine
