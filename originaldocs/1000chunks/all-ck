Yeah. 
And so put it in reverse, I assume? 
Right, in reverse and turned around, cut 
4 him off because they were still in the middle of the 
5 street. When he passed them, he had to get a better 
6 angle so he could get closer to them, I guess. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A So yes, you are right. From my angle, the 
9 truck was there.

Q 
Right, uh-huh, that's the north side. 
You are standing on the sidewalk on the

A 
Q 
Right. 
And your apartment is actually on the

1 A No, it bends around. See how it bends 
2 around? The truck is pointing this way, I'm still 
3 looking down toward it, I'm still, I'm looking at 
4 the passenger side. 
5 Q Okay. Now, from the point that you saw 
6 Michael Brown stop and he turned around, to the 
7 point where he eventually fell into the street, can 
8 you give me an idea, your best estimate of how far 
9 that was? 
10 A I'm only guessing from where the officer 
11 was standing the first time he stopped, about 30, 
12 35 feet.

1 recall when he turned around, did he turn around so 
2 that he faced your direction or did he turn the 
3 other way clockwise or counterclockwise or do you 
4 know? 
5 A He turned over left. So that would be 
6 what, counterclockwise, yeah. 
7 Q So if you are the officer and I'm Mike 
8 Brown. 
9 A Spin to your left, turn around to your 
10 left, like that.

12 back went to you?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Uh-huh. 
Now, you said in a previous statement that 
17 when he was looking down, it looked like he might 
18 have been looking at his hands. 
19 A Hands or side or whatever, he was trying 
20 to look, I said looking at his body to try to see 
21 where he was shot. 
22 Q And you said previously that you could see 
23 something on his hand? 
24 A Yeah, it looked like he had something from 
25 the distance, we weren't quite sure. In fact, we

1 kind of discussed that. I have told the officer it 
2 looks like he had something on his hand, but I can't 
3 give you 100 percent, I can't say for 100 percent 
4 that it was something.

10 
Q 
A 
Q 
Sure. 
You know, that's what I thought. 
As he turned around and he's turning 
11 around away from you to face the officer, then if 
12 he's on this corner and you are right here, you're 
13 seeing him primarily from behind? 
14 A Right, his back was turned. When he got 
15 to the edge of the driveway where your finger is, 
16 his back was turned to us and his back was facing 
17 our side of the street. He had stopped. This is 
18 the street, he stopped and he did like this. And he 
19 was turning around like this, you know, on the left 
20 side as you turn, that's the way he was turning. 
21 Q He turned to face the officer, was the 
22 officer in the street actually? 
23 A Yes, he was at the rear of his vehicle at 
24 that time. He had to pull his gun out and he had it 
25 in his hand, you know, the defensive spot I guess,

1 or whatever they said it is. 
2 Q Michael Brown would have been looking back 
3 in this direction? 
4 A He was looking, okay. The officer was 
5 standing on this side out in the middle of the 
6 street right here. He was looking this direction, 
7 not that way. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
This is the sidewalk right here. 
Well, he is looking out this way because 
10 the officer's truck is still in the street. He's at 
11 the rear of the truck, he's at the rear of his 
12 vehicle. 
13 Q And his vehicle was pretty much in the 
14 middle of the road, correct?

17 road? 
18 
A 
Q 
A 
Right. 
So the officer is in the middle of the

20 street, to the sidewalk.

4 that point, correct?

Q 
No, just the side view.

7 that point his hands go up?

Yes. 
And the officer is telling him to stop, 
10 but he moves towards the officer? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And if I were to tell you that from 
13 this corner of Caddiefield, I'm sorry, Canfield

16 when he fell down, okay, and his body laid there. 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
All right. 
From his feet to that corner is 48 feet 
19 and 2 inches, does that sound about right? 
20 A I couldn't say for a certainty. If you 
21 say that's the measurement, that's what it is. I 
22 don't know the distance.

1 travel, he moved from this corner toward the officer 
2 until he was down dead in the street? 
3 A Right. 
4 Q And if that was measured, I don't want you 
5 to comment on somebody else's accuracy, if someone 
6 measured it and said it was 48 feet and 2 inches? 
7 A I would have to agree. 
Q Does that sound about right? 8 
9 A I would have to agree, but I'm saying from 
10 my vantage point from what I thought or assumed, it 
11 looks like it was about 35 feet. If it measured 
12 that much, then it is. 
13 Q Okay. And as you say he turns around, he 
14 puts his hand up and he starts to move toward the 
15 officer, you hear the officer tell him to stop? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q And you said he gets two or three steps 
18 and the officer shoots pow, pow, pow, three or four 
19 times? 
20 A Yeah. 
21 Q And at that point you kind of acted, not 
22 acted, I didn't mean to say acted, but you 
23 demonstrated that he kind of appeared to have been 
24 hit? 
25 A Yes.

Okay. And then he takes a few more steps 
13 toward the officer, I mean, if the measurement is 
14 correct, at some point he travels 42, or 48 feet and 
15 2 inches from the corner to where his feet were. 
16 But he only moves twice, according to what your 
17 recollection is, correct? 
18 A First time when he told him to stop, he 
19 moved and stepped out into the street. Then he 
20 started to stagger forward, the officer took some 
21 steps back. He told him to stop, he yelled stop 
22 three times again and after he yelled the third stop 
23 he fired again. 
24 Q Okay. Now, after the first round of 
25 shots, not in the car, but after Michael Brown

A Yes. 
Q Or thereabouts? 
A Correct, about shoulder height. 
Q After he turned around, now you've said

8 sides? 
9 A Yeah, well, they started to come down 
10 after he fired off that first volley. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
He started coming, he was trying to keep 
13 himself up. He looked like he was hit, so his hands 
14 were naturally coming down. 
15 Q So if you have a profile of him. 
16 A Uh-huh. 
17 Q And his hands are like this, as his hands 
18 come down, could it be that his hand went somewhere 
19 
20 
around his torso? (indicating) 
A No, his hands kind of came, they were 
21 still out to the side, he was still like this. He 
22 was trying to balance hisself, his hands came down 
23 about chest or waist. He had his head up looking at 
24 him and he was staggering, trying to stay on his 
25 feet.

1 As he was moving, he was staggering 
2 and that's when my sister-in-law and said, 
3 oh, my God, he's getting ready to kill him. And 
4 that's when the officer was backing up and that's 
5 when he fired, I think he yelled stop, excuse me, he 
6 fired the next round, next volley. 
7 Q Okay. I'm not going to be so, I'm not 
8 going to belabor this too terribly much. Do you 
9 recall in your statement with the County Police, you 
10 said after he was shot the first time his arms went 
11 limp to his side? 
12 A I said his arms were coming down, yes, 
13 they were coming down.

15 opportunity to review your statements and I 
16 understand that and your first statement was on

1 looking at hisself to see what is going on. And he 
2 started to turn with his back to me like this, he 
3 had his hands up like this, and he looked at the 
4 officer. The officer was at the back of his truck, 
5 he yells stop.

8 He was walking towards him, but he had his hands up 
9 like this. (indicating) 
10 When he stepped out into the street, 
11 the officer fired three times. When he hit him, he 
12 started to stagger around and his hands started,

14 and he was staggering toward the officer. 
15 As he was moving towards the officer, 
16 the officer was moving back, and the officer told 
17 him stop, stop, stop. By the time he said the third 
18 stop, Michael was still trying to stay up on his 
19 feet. That's when the comments were made behind me, 
20 no, he's not going to shoot him again, the man can't 
21 even stand on his feet. The next thing I know, he 
22 fired the other shots. 
23 He couldn't hardly stand up, so when 
24 he fired, he was going down. When I went down and I 
25 looked and I'm saying okay, that's the only way he

1 could have hit him in the head. He had to be going

3 Everyone come back from the back 
4 said, oh, no, he went down to his knees. He did not 
5 go down to his knees. And then they said, the

7 his head. No, that's not what happened, okay. The

9 no, he didn't do that. 
10 Michael did not go down on his knees 
11 and stand there like that in front of the officer

It went from whew, it was terrible. 
And from the time that Michael Brown 
4 stopped on that corner until he fell in the street, 
5 are we talking about a matter of just a few seconds? 
6 A A few seconds. Again, that incident as 
7 I've described from the people coming up, that 
8 incident after that first shot, initial shot at the 
9 truck when they ran it went from zero to 100 in a 
10 split second also. It was slow motion to us, but it 
11 was moving. 
12 Q And just backing up briefly and talking 
13 about what happened up at the truck. You said that 
14 because the truck was pointed toward Northwinds and 
15 they're on the driver's side, the car is between you 
16 and them, correct?

Okay. 
I could not tell you. I could not see.

7 out of the truck and/or Michael they say he got out 
8 and Michael pushed him back in. We can't see that 
9 because we are on the opposite side. 
10 All I know is that when we heard that 
11 shot and his friend went that way and Michael went 
12 there, the officer exited his vehicle, came around 
13 to the back and assumed the position. That's what 
14 we saw.

17 It went bam, bam, bam, bam, it went so fast. 
18 Q But do you remember on August 12th, again, 
19 I'll show you here on a transcript when the officer 
20 was asking you, and he's talking about what was 
21 happening, what was going on at the car. 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And Detective says, who never 
24 exited the car? And you said, the officer. And he 
25 says, okay. And you said, he never exited. He shot

1 him to get him off of him, that was your impression 
2 on the 12th? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
Right, that's my impression on the 12th. 
Okay. Has that changed, do you still feel 
5 that the officer, in your opinion, it looked look he 
6 was trying to get him off of him? 
7 A Whatever was going on in that truck, if 
8 Michael had a grip on him or he had a grip on 
9 Michael, some way he just felt the only way he can 
10 get him out or so that he can get control of the 
11 situation was to fire. He fired. 
12 When he came out and he stepped out 
13 into that street and he fired the first volley, we 
14 figure okay, that's it. We were also yelling at 
15 him, and my sister-in-law yelling, stop 
16 man, stop, stop, stop. 
17 As he was staggering forward, that's 
18 when he said oh, my God, he's getting ready to kill 
19 him because he backed up, the officer backed up and 
20 then he shot him again. 
21 To this day no one is going to change 
22 my mind, if he had not fired that last volley, that 
23 young man would have been alive. Because even 
24 though he was coming toward him, he had no weapon. 
25 His hands were coming down. They were not in front

1 of him they, were to his side. 
2 Q Okay. 
3 A He was staggering, trying to stay on his 
4 feet. The only way he could have got shot in the 
5 top of his head when he was firing that last round, 
6 he was on his way down, he hit him in the top of his 
7 head. Eye, top, only way. 
8 Q So in a matter of seconds, you can clearly 
9 see that Michael Brown was going down? 
10 A Right. 
11 Q When the second volley went out? 
12 A Right. 
13 Q When the second volley went out. 
14 A That second volley went off, he was 
15 coming, you can almost tell his body was going limp 
16 because he was like this, he was like this. He was 
17 looking up at him, like I'm looking at you and I'm 
18 still trying to stay on my feet. Only way he could 
19 do was go down, he's top heavy. The man was 
20 290 pounds. (indicating) 
21 Q But from this point to where he moved 
22 toward the officer, you would agree if the 
23 measurement said 48 feet, that that's about right? 
24 
25 
A I said 30, 35, if it says 48, it was 48.

1 questions? 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, just for 
3 clarification. 
4 Q (By Ms. Whirley) You heard the first shot 
5 in the car; is that correct? 
6 A 
7 Q 
8 shots? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
At the car. 
And when was the next time you heard 
Was when Michael got to this driveway. 
Okay. So when the shot was fired at the 
11 police car, Michael ran? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Right. 
Did the officer trot or run after him? 
No, he exited his vehicle, Michael was 
15 going in this direction to here. He had to come 
16 around so he can get an eye on him. If he went 
17 around to this side, I don't think he could have 
18 seen him. I mean, if he hadn't of stopped, I don't 
19 think he would of had a good line of sight on him. 
20 I think in his mind, the only way he 
21 thought maybe he thought he was going to run back 
22 the way he came, I don't know. 
23 
24 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
What was going through the officer's mind, 
25 I don't know his procedure or what they are trained

1 to do. All I know is he came out of the car and he 
2 came around to the back. He was standing at the 
3 rear. 
4 Q Okay. Did he shoot at Michael Brown while 
5 Michael Brown was running? 
6 A We didn't hear no shots until after he got 
7 there and he moved off. When Michael got there, he 
8 had already stopped. He stood right there and the 
9 officer told him stop. 
10 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Even though he had already stopped. 
Okay. So between the time that Michael 
13 Brown ran from the police car and Michael was at the 
14 intersection of Copper Creek --

Q 
20 to stop? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No. 
So Michael Brown, he tells Michael Brown 
Right. 
Michael Brown had stopped, but his back 
23 was to the officer? 
24 A Yes, and he was turning, he was turning as 
25 the officer yells stop.

1 Q 
Page 147 
At the time that his back was to the 
2 officer, did it appear to you that he had been shot? 
3 A I assume that he was because his hands was 
4 up, he was standing with his back to us, but he was 
5 looking at his body. As he was turning, he was 
6 still looking down. And, you know, when he yelled 
7 stop, his head came up and was looking at the 
8 
9 
officer, and he did like this. (indicating) 
Q Okay. So when he had his back to the 
10 officer and he had stopped at that intersection that 
11 we just talked about. 
12 
13 
14 time? 
A Right here. (indicating) 
Q He appeared to be shot to you at that 
15 I assumed he was. A 
Q 
A 17 Because of the proximity of him and the 
18 officer at the truck. 
19 Q 
20 truck? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
You felt he must have been shot at the 
Right. 
Okay. So he turned around and you already 
23 demonstrated that he had, he was staggering and he 
24 had his hands up, was it in your opinion was he 
25 surrendering at that point?

1 A When he left from here and he was walking 
2 toward him, I believe he was giving up. 
3 Q Why? 
4 A Because his hands was up, he was walking 
5 toward him. Where was he going to go. The officer 
6 was standing there with a gun dead aimed on him. 
7 Q And you never saw a weapon with, you never 
8 saw Michael Brown with a weapon? 
A No, no. 9 
10 Q Did you ever see Michael Brown appear to 
11 be reaching for a weapon? 
12 A No, no, his arms never went down to reach 
13 for his belt, his hands stayed in this position 
14 until he stepped off, off of this right here into 
15 the street. And then when he got shot, that's when 
16 his arms started moving. He was like oh, my God, 
17 that's it, okay. 
18 At that time when he fired off that 
19 first volley right there, it still didn't look like 
20 he was trying to reach for any weapon, he was trying 
21 to see what was going on, where he was hit, all 
22 right. 
23 As he was coming off of there and 
24 fired that next volley, his hands were coming down 
25 beside his body. It was like he got hit, that's it.

1 He started staggering, he was staggering as he was 
2 doing it. As he came, his body, his torso, his legs 
3 were straight up, but his torso was almost like at a 
4 45 degree angle with his head came up to look at the 
5 officer. 
6 The officer moved back three steps as 
7 Michael was walking toward him or staggering toward 
8 him, he took about three steps back and he was still 
9 yelling. I clearly heard him tell Mike, stop, stop, 
10 stop. But you can say that the man was in distress, 
11 he was trying to stay on his feet. As he said that, 
12 after he said the last stop, he fired. 
13 Q Could you tell, I know you said you are 
14 not good with distances, but could you tell how far 
15 the officer was from Michael Brown when he fired 
16 those last shots? 
17 A After looking at it, again, I'm bad at 
18 distances, but I would say at least about 20, 
19 25 feet. 
20 Q 20, 25 feet. Okay. I'm going to walk out 
21 and by that I mean I'm going to come where you are 
22 in this room.

Uh-huh.

3 A Okay.
