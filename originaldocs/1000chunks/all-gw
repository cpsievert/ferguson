1 A You would try to do that, yeah. You don't 
2 always have the opportunity. 
3 I don't think you want to 
4 leave it out there. 
5 A You don't always have that opportunity. 
6 I'm trying to place a 
7 scenario more kind of what you are taught thing, 
8 trying to phrase this scenario, we are just trying 
9 to learn to understand also. 
10 Again, you're doing a stop where you are 
11 in your vehicle and there's a pedestrian, a 
12 pedestrian stop. Would you or would you teach 
13 someone to use their vehicle as a device to impede 
14 someone's course of walk or the direction they are 
15 headed, would you take your vehicle and block it in 
16 their path to address that? 
17 A At certain times you would. 
18 Do you think that could be 
19 seen as aggressive? 
A By the suspect? 
Yes. 
20 
21 
22 A Of course, yeah, people see a lot of 
23 things that we do as aggressive just the way we are 
24 trained. Yeah, you could use your vehicle to block 
25 the path of someone.

1 Thank you. 
2 You would need a reason to 
3 block that path so at that point if you've asked 
4 somebody to do something and they haven't done that, 
5 then you would need to use aggression, wouldn't you, 
6 if you are trying to get them to do what you told 
7 them to do they haven't done it. 
8 A They're not in compliance. 
9 It is not really aggressive, 
10 it is taking the necessary steps to do what you 
11 asked them to do.

Seven years. 
Can you describe for the either grand

18 different from maybe a nurse or a physician? 
19 A So we are considered midlevel providers. 
20 So we have master's level degree training. We 
21 practice medicine under the supervision of a 
22 physician. So in our particular practice we would 
23 practice in the same manner that a physician would. 
24 Our charts are reviewed at the end of the day by the 
25 physician.

Would there be times when you might

16 call in a physician to assess a patient? 
17 A Yes.

19 or things that don't appear to be emergent in

1 A No. In the State of Missouri midlevels do 
2 the have the option to obtain a controlled substance 
3 license as well as DEA number. Most of the 
4 midlevels in our facility do not because it is 
5 unnecessary. We don't prescribe a lot of narcotics 
6 and the little times we do, a physician is always 
7 on-site to cosign our prescription.

Q 
Yes. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) If you were to 
17 prescribe, for example, a nonnarcotic medication or 
18 something that's not a controlled substance like 
19 Naprosyn, is it Naprosyn or Naproxen? 
20 A Naprosyn is a brand name and Naproxen is 
21 the generic.

So if I get that, it has to be prescribed? 
Correct. 
But being nonnarcotic, you can write the 
12 prescription for me? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And then if you were to have a DEA number 
15 and have obtained the ability to prescribe 
16 controlled substances, and that's an option for a 
17 midlevel care physician's assistant, correct? 
18 
19

1 ask you this then. Can you describe for the grand 
2 jurors what your training and background is in order 
3 to be a physician's assistant? 
4 A So I have my undergraduate degree, my 
5 bachelor of science in athletic training. And then 
6 I went on to graduate school where I got my master's 
7 of science in physician assistant studies. So in 
8 total with the 2 degrees it was about seven years of 
9 training. 
10 Q And then when you, do you have to pass any 
11 board examinations in order to be a physician 
12 assistant? 
13 A Yes. We have a national certified board 
14 that we have to certify initially and then every six 
15 years after that. 
16 Q And so a physician's assistant would not 
17 be considered, obviously, you are not a medical 
18 doctor, correct? 
19 A Correct. 
20 Q But a physician's assistant has more 
21 education and training than, for example, a 
22 registered nurse or a practical nurse? 
23 A Correct. 
24 Q Okay. And so when you are working, and

A 
Q 
Is that affiliated with any hospital? 
Christian Northeast. 
Is it a part of Christian Northeast? 
Yes. 
So if somebody has an emergent situation, 
8 they are going to go to Christian Northeast, would 
9 they come into your department? 
10 A They may. It just depends on their 
11 location. The two emergency rooms are about 7 miles 
12 apart. It depends on where they're located. 
13 Q On August 9th, where was your department 
14 located?

Q 
At Northwest Health Care. 
Okay. And is your department attached to 
17 a hospital?

A 
Q 
No. 
So if a patient walked in and there was 
20 some acute injury that needed more, needed something

And so is it required that after you see a

2 point he needs to sign off on your charts on your 
3 evaluation? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q And now in this case, you know that you're 
6 here because you were the attending, the nurse's, 
7 I'm sorry, physician's assistant who evaluated 
8 Darren Wilson on August 9th?

1 four hours like everybody has to before a doctor can 
2 see you? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q Sorry, I couldn't resist that jab. We've 
5 all been there. So a nurse will do an initial 
6 assessment to do how quickly this patient needs to 
7 be seen? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Right. 
Does that nurse take some basic 
10 information from the patient? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after that nurse, for example, if 
13 that nurse determines that this is not a patient 
14 that needs to be seen like, you know, ASAP or stat, 
15 or whatever your language is, then who would the 
16 next person be that that patient will see? 
17 A The patient would then likely see one of 
18 our techs who would bring the patient back to a room 
19 whenever it became available. 
20 They would take vital signs for the 
21 patient and then the person after that would 
22 actually be the nurse that would be caring for the 
23 patient while they were in the exam room.

3 back to the examine room, whether it be before they 
4 are seen by the nurse or after they're seen by me.

1 looking at this, this is an admission form? 
2 A Correct, this is something that 
3 registration would fill out. 
4 Q So this has to do with insurance and just 
5 basic pedigree information, address and so forth? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q So then the next page is an abstract 
8 summary. Now you and I talked about this and what 
9 is, what we call coders. There are people in the 
10 hospital that have to at some point put codes into 
11 these records so that the insurance gets billed for 
12 the right procedure for what was done, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q So these codes on here for the diagnosis, 
15 reason for and then there's primary diagnosis and 
16 then secondary diagnosis, it is difficult to see 
17 because they are in those black bars. Those are all 
18 things that a coder selects based upon what they 
19 read in the records was the diagnosis, correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And they have to select from a finite 
22 number of options to put a code in, correct? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q All right. So this is mainly for 
25 insurance reasons?

7 Q So is this the information that the triage 
8 nurse would have taken or the triage person as you 
9 said? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q Okay. And so down in the paragraph it 
12 says triage, it says chief complaint quote, and then 
13 in quotes it says, he needs x-rays he was hit in the 
14 face a couple of times. 
15 You're not the person who entered 
16 that into that paragraph, correct? 
17 A No, that was our triage nurse who sits out 
18 front in our waiting room. 
19 Q Do you know if the triage nurse got that 
20 information from the patient or could it have been 
21 from somebody with the patient? 
22 A I believe it was somebody with the 
23 patient, specifically his supervisor.

25 police officer's supervisor?

2 Q And then also down it says here that on 
3 the next line, the patient presented with St. Louis 
4 County Police to the emergency room for evaluation. 
5 So that means he was with police 
6 officers, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And then it says from home? 
9 A Right. So, yeah, usually the nurse, the 
10 triage nurse will ask, you know, did they come from, 
11 say if they were in a car accident, did they come 
12 straight from the car accident or did they go home 
13 first and then come from home. 
14 At some point he must have said that 
15 he came from home. Now whether or not he did or 
16 not, that's not something I discussed with him. 
17 Q Okay. So that's a note that's put in by 
18 the triage nurse? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And whether or not Darren Wilson said that 
21 or one of the people with him told her that, or 
22 whether or not that's even accurate, we don't know? 
23 A Correct.

1 warm and dry. 
2 So what is the triage nurse assessing 
3 when she's looking at someone's skin? 
4 A Just that he's not, that he's not pale or 
5 sweating excessively or blue or red or having any 
6 obvious issues with circulation or difficulty 
7 breathing, which may change their skin color. 
8 Q This is part of a neurologic examine. Not 
9 like you are noticing that he has redness to his 
10 forehead? 
11 A Correct. Just very initial exam. Is the 
12 patient upright, is he aware what's going on, is he 
13 able to speak. 
14 Q And, again, downward in the medical 
15 screening continued, the note is that the skin is 
16 pink, warm and dry. Is that just in general the 
17 skin on his body appears to be normal? 
A Just in general, yes. 
Q And then patient denies physical or 
18 
19 
20 emotional abuse. Is the patient asked if he was 
21 abused? 
22 A This is a question that every patient gets 
23 asked when they come into our department and it is 
24 referring to domestic abuse at home.

1 involving this patient? 
A No. 2 
3 Q So every patient, and I think you said 
4 even if they came in for a sore throat or cold is 
5 asked that question? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And then on the next page, also down where 
8 it says abuse screening, it says patient states that 
9 he or she is not a victim of violence. Is that 
10 domestic violence specifically? 
A Yes, domestic. 11 
12 Q He's not asked if somebody hurt you, he's 
13 asked if anybody had any domestic assault or 
14 domestic violence?

3 times graded his pain consistently on those four 
4 occasions a six out of ten? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q And then where it says description, it 
7 says aching. Is that something the patient provided 
8 or would the nurse put that in there? 
9 A The nurse would have given him some 
10 options for description, such as sharp, or stabbing 
11 or aching or throbbing. And then the patient would 
12 pick the one that most fits it. 
13 Q So Darren Wilson on that day said my pain 
14 is aching and it is six out of ten? 
A Correct. 15 
16 Q Okay. And then on the next page under

History of present illness. 
Patient presents with CO bilateral jaw 
Complaint of bilateral jaw pain. 
Okay. So now when you are taking a 
8 history of present illness, what is the purpose to 
9 do that? 
10 A This is basically just what the patient 
11 tells us directly. It is not what I see or what I 
12 find on examine, it is just the incident that 
13 occurred, the information that was provided directly 
14 from the patient, and then what their specific 
15 complaint is as far as the injury. 
16 Q All right. So the patient may say, I fell 
17 down the stairs and hit my head on the concrete 
18 floor?

25 down the stairs or you just trying to find out how

1 the incident occurred? 
2 A We might ask what, you know, as far as 
3 falling down the stairs, what made them fall and 
4 they can say oh, I tripped, I slipped, I passed out 
5 and then I fell down the stairs. 
6 Q Okay. And in this case, someone who says 
7 I have bilateral joint pain after being punched in 
8 the face while attempting to detain a suspect, he 
9 was also scratched in the neck. Again, that's stuff 
10 that Darren Wilson told you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Did you then inquire about what were you 
13 going to try to arrest the suspect for, what 
14 happened immediately prior to being punched in the 
15 face? 
16 A No, no, that's not stuff we would go into. 
17 Q Okay. And let me ask you to clarify. You 
18 know that this examine you did was in relation to 
19 Officer Wilson and his involvement that culminated 
20 in the shooting of Mike Brown, right? 
21 A I do now, we were unaware of the event at 
22 the time. 
23 Q Okay. So when you were treating Darren 
24 Wilson, you didn't know anything about Mike Brown 
25 having been shot?

A Correct. 1 
2 Q Would you have treated him any differently 
3 or is there something that now you look back I wish 
4 I would have done had I known? 
5 A No, basically because his complaint was 
6 jaw pain, our focus is, you know, how did the jaw 
7 pain occur. He got punched. What, who punched him, 
8 you know, and then what his complaint is as far as 
9 pain or any complications from that. 
10 But from a medical standpoint it is 
11 not going to change how we treat him or what we do 
12 based on what led up to that event. 
13 Q Okay. And ultimately, you know, after you 
14 having reviewed this record, you diagnosed him with 
15 contusion of the mandibular joint area?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
And so your mandible is your jaw, correct? 
Correct. 
So what is a contusion? 
Contusion is basically a bruise, 
21 inflammation, irritation to the soft tissue. 
22 Q And we talked about that a little bit ago 
23 about bruising and we all have had bruises, we've 
24 had kids that had bruises, do people bruise 
25 differently?
