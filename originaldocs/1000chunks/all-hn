25 when you get down to discussing it, I can print that

1 out or something, you understand the difference, the 
2 distinction, okay? 
3 GRAND JUROR: Tell us those three aga1n, 
4 one 1s committed the offense? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Probable cause to believe 
6 that he committed the offense, which means that he 
7 met all the elements of that offense. You remember 
8 that from your grand Jury days. And you must find 
9 probable cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not 
10 act in lawful self-defense and you must find 
11 probable cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not 
12 use lawful force in making an arrest. And only if 
13 you find those things, which is kind of like finding 
14 a negative, you cannot return an indictment on 
15 anything or true bill unless you find both of those 
16 things. Because both are complete defenses to any 
17 offense and they both have been raised in his, 1n 
18 the evidence. So any other questions about the law? 
19 Okay. And then just one last thing is 
20 that Sheila and I talked about making, we can't make 
21 a closing argument to you and we're not going to, 
22 but I wanted to say something and I asked Sheila if 
23 she would, if we could prepare a statement together 
24 to say and so I just wanted to first thank you. We 
25 both wanted to thank you and how difficult this has 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 140 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 been and the sacrifice that we know you all have 
2 family and jobs and we understand the burden it has 
3 been for you to be here for now 24 days, 25 days 
4 that you've actually been here. 
5 We also want you to understand that your 
6 decision, whatever it is, should be based on the 
7 evidence that you heard in here and the law that 
8 we've explained to you, not based upon what the 
9 media says, not based upon public opinion, not based 
10 upon your fears, you have to base it on the evidence 
11 and the law. 
12 And whatever that decision is, it will be 
13 the correct decision and we will stand by that 
14 100 percent, whatever your decision 1s. 
15 And then finally I wanted to say, and 
16 Sheila agrees, but we wanted to point out that if at 
17 times it seemed like in our questions we were 
18 somehow expressing our op1n1ons either about what we 
19 think the evidence 1s, or about the credibility of a 
20 witness. We want you to understand as attorneys it 
21 is our job to challenge witnesses' statements and 
22 that sometimes, you know, you don't get to the truth 
23 unless you challenge a witness statement. 
24 We have not had any particular rhyme or 
25 reason what witnesses we have taken, we have kind of 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 141 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 traded off just because we are sharing the workload, 
2 but if at any time you felt that we were trying to 
3 express our opinion to you, we certainly were not. 
4 Sheila said, as attorneys either of us can 
5 argue either point effectively and well because 
6 that's what we do, but in challenging witnesses, and 
7 I know that many of you have asked challenging 
8 questions of the witnesses as well, it is up to you 
9 to determine the facts and it 1s up to you to 
10 determine the credibility of the witnesses that 
11 testify and don't read into anything about what you 
12 think our op1n1ons are because really our opinions 
13 don't matter, it is up to you and what you guys 
14 think. 
15 So with that being said, thank you, thank 
16 you very much. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you very much. And I 
18 just want to add, you know attorneys, they cannot 
19 stop talking. I have to have the last word. That I 
20 totally agree with that and we were trying to g1ve 
21 you a balanced presentation of the evidence. So you 
22 might see us go back and forth because we are trying 
23 to keep it balanced for you, and get to the truth 
24 and hopefully that was accomplished. 
25 And I think you are going to make the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 142

1 right decision, I think you are very bright, I have 
2 said that since I first met you many, many months, 
3 ago it seems now. Do you work, if you need 
4 anything, we will be out here. Thank you. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, do you want to go on 
6 record and say what time it is and that we are then 
7 leaving the room. 
8 I know I got the last word in, didn't I. 
9 (Grand jury starts deliberations at 3:04 
10 p.m.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: It is approximately 5:55 
12 p.m. and we are going to recess for the evening and 
13 reconvene Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. We are 
14 waiting on the autopsy report of and we 
15 are hoping it will be here before noon Monday. So 
16 with that, we are in recess for today.
