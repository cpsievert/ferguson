10 instances where he has asked for backup?

Is that my understanding? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
14 You said the length of 
15 time it took for him was out of character? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Would there be a reason, 
18 Do you know of a reason for an officer 
19 to ask for backup that quickly? 
20 A Maybe because he felt that there was 
21 something about the way they looked, or the way they 
22 were acting or just that there was something 
23 suspicious about them. 
24 It could have been that 
25 they fit the description of the people at the

5 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask, do they 
6 generally, you mention a pedestrian check, do they 
7 generally get out of the car for a pedestrian check? 
8 A Most of the time, yeah, because they get 
9 out of the car and ask them for identification and I 
10 run them through the computer to insure they're not 
11 wanted. 
12 Q Knowing whether they are in the car or 
13 they are on their portable is generally they're not 
14 in their car on their mobile doing checks with 
15 pedestrians that are standing at the car?

14 cars.

17 a question about that because when he gets to 
18 Glenark, you ever notice that you guys, he never 
19 says I'm 23 or I"m out when he gets to Glenark? He 
20 just kind of says en route, we hear nothing from

2 A That is correct. 
3 If another officer is 
4 responding to that call because the main officer 
5 that's assigned there is doing something else, okay,

8 just take over for the officers that are there, you 
9 understand what? 
10 A Generally they do not. Generally the 
11 officer that has the report finishes the report, but 
12 I do understand what you are saying. 
13 Okay. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So if Officer Wilson is 
15 leaving a call and now he's going back in service
