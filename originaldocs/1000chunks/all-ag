Is that unusual that a deceased person

7 Q And in this case, you mentioned that there 
8 were a number of times where everybody had to kind 
9 of stop what they were doing because the scene was 
10 becoming dangerous? 
11 A Yes, ma'am. Not only do you have to take 
12 into the fact what we were dealing with at the scene 
13 security and personal safety, but St. Louis County, 
14 who was requested to the scene to investigate, we 
15 were not notified until almost an hour afterwards. 
16 If you look at the time of four hours as a whole, we 
17 only got there a little after 1:00 to start our 
18 investigation.

20 imagine it is fairly clear to everyone, this is the 
21 driver's side of this vehicle, correct?

5 , this may be 
6 answered later, I don't know. I just want to know 
7 why is the door closed, do we have any idea why the 
8 door of the SUV was closed or was it reentered? 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: That will probably be 
10 addressed by other people. This detective wasn't 
11 present beforehand and as he had said, his statement 
12 is this is how it was when he got there. So there 
13 will be other witnesses who are going to be called 
14 to testify being first on the scene, what they saw, 
15 whether they photographed anything, but that's the 
16 way he observed it. 
17 Any other questions about Image Number 2? 
18 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Image Number 3, again, 
19 it has got your three on there. Describe what that 
20 image shows? 
21 A This is kind of, I moved slightly east 
22 from the first viewpoint, and typically what I would 
23 do when I'm photographing an overall scene 
24 photograph, I would stand in one spot and just pan 
25 my camera taking this angle, I twist, this angle,

1 piece of crime scene tape was the barrier to the 
2 crime scene. After several people had torn down the 
3 crime scene tape, run onto the scene, the gunshots 
4 being fired, the crowd would run from this building 
5 in particular from this side of the crime scene, 
6 around this building, through the parking lot to 
7 this side of the crime scene, depending on what was 
8 happening. 
9 We had an opening where the crowd had 
10 run to the eastern end of the crime scene. So 
11 several people moved or put up a new set of crime 
12 scene tape farther back into the parking lot to try 
13 to keep people farther away from the crime scene. 
14 Q Okay. So that was done not because you 
15 determined that somehow this area was now a part of 
16 the crime scene, it was done to keep the crowd from 
17 encroaching upon the crime scene? 
A Yes, ma'am. 18

Q So there's no particular processing of 
this scene, you didn't suddenly say I'm going to go

A No, ma'am. The only thing I think that we 
did in that area was film a witness' perspective 
24 with our video cameras and that is even farther back 
25 from where that crime scene tape is set.

4 five. Can you describe for them what you're seeing, 
5 what this image depicts? 
6 A From this angle, I think you are going to 
7 start to see that I am in the middle of what I would 
8 deem the crime scene looking east on the south side, 
9 I'm sorry, looking west from the south side of the 
10 road, and I will start kind of a pan from my left to 
11 my right.

13 police car, the cone that had been set up, my crime

15 scene van was just inside the initial crime scene 
16 tape. You can see a crowd of people gathering there 
17 on top of this hill and, of course, you can see the 
18 amount of vehicle traffic that is now blocking 
19 Canfield.

(By Ms. Alizadeh) Image Number 8. Can you

13 A Same scene or same location, I've now 
14 turned further to the east. This is, I believe this 
15 is Caddiefield, at the intersection of Canfield and 
16 Caddiefield. A Ferguson police car, an SUV was not 
17 described to me, was not there at the scene, it was 
18 put in place to block the body. 
19 Where the white sheet is laying 
20 between this police car and the orange body screens 
21 is Michael Brown's body. 
22 I'm not sure what department vehicle 
23 that is, again, it is a police SUV used to block 
24 this street and to assist with security at the crime 
25 scene.

8 evidence that they had located. Under the sheet is 
9 where Michael Brown's body is located. The sheet 
10 was also placed there prior to my arrival. 
11 The orange body screens are things 
12 that I added to the scene when I arrived to assist

2 left out of frame and this is Darren Wilson's police 
3 car. 
4 I have a 
5 question, are you by yourself as you are walking 
6 around doing these photographs or anybody with you? 
7 A During the video process of it, since it 
8 is a continuous video, at this particular scene I 
9 typically would have one person, another crime scene 
10 detective that is assisting me walk with me, 
11 basically with a hand on my shoulder making sure I 
12 don't trip over something in a hallway or a street, 
13 because I'm looking directly at that view finder so 
14 I can get the perspective I want to. 
15 This particular case there was, I was 
16 running the video and I had three other crime scene, 
17 two other detectives and my detective sergeant. One 
18 was guiding me so I didn't trip or step on anything, 
19 the other two to get the perspective for the video. 
20 I had to get very close to the crowd. So the two 
21 people that were assisting him were making sure the 
22 crowd wasn't going to grab, push, throw, do 
23 something to us.

1 show the area which we were looking at. 
2 Number 25. I didn't initial it. As 
3 the perspective goes from the diagram, I'm now 
4 standing on the northwest corner of the crime scene 
5 looking east, Caddiefield is on your right, Copper 
6 Creek Court is here on your left, and then the two 
7 vehicles that were blocking Michael Brown's body. 
8 Number 26. Same perspective just, 
9 turning to my right bracketing the photo. 
10 Number 27. Turning farther to my 
11 right, you can no longer see the two vehicles that 
12 were blocking the body and this is the center of 
13 Canfield. 
14 Number 28. I'm on the north side of 
15 the road facing almost directly south in the middle 
16 of the crime scene. You can see on the right-hand 
17 side of this photograph, the back end of Darren 
18 Wilson's police car that has the crime scene tape 
19 applied directly to it. The crime scene tape that 
20 you see on the ground again from one of the earlier 
21 photos, that was one of the crime scene tape 
22 officially put after the crowd moved. They were 
23 able to take that down and move that crime scene 
24 perimeter back.

1 further, the previous picture you could see the tail 
2 end of the car. Here again is the police car in its 
3 entirety and the tape had been torn down. 
4 Number 30. I've now moved farther to 
5 the west. Still on the north side of the street, 
6 this is the front end of Darren Wilson's police car. 
7 Q Now, let me stop you here. As a part of 
8 the scene like this type of scene, if you had noted 
9 or scene, for example, tire marks, whether they are 
10 skid marks or marks in the grass indicating 
11 possibly, you know, the travel of the vehicle, the 
12 speed it was traveling and so forth, and you're not 
13 an accident reconstruction person, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
If you had seen tire tracks, like skid 
16 marks around this vehicle, would you have documented 
17 those? 
18 A Yes, that would have been something that I 
19 would have recognized as probably important to the 
20 scene. No tire tracks of any sort, any skid marks 
21 or I didn't notice any and none were brought to my 
22 attention and I didn't document anything. 
23 Q And in preparation for your testimony 
24 today, did you and I look in these photographs and 
25 did you look to see if you could see in those

4 marks? 
5 A 
We did, yes. 
Did you see any type of tire marks or skid 
No, it was images that we looked at that 
6 had closer views of the tires on his police car that 
7 were actually focused on pieces of evidence, and we 
8 could not see any type of skid or tread mark 
9 anywhere. 
10 Q And those pictures are included in your 
11 batch of pictures? 
12 
13 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Was it brought to your 
14 attention, this is Sheila Whirley, was it brought to 
15 your attention that you should look for skid marks.

Number 31. Same perspective where I had 
21 moved, I could see in front of Darren Wilson's 
22 police car. Now looking back farther to the east, 
23 kind of bracketing photos from my right to my left 
24 this time.

1 from the northwest corner looking almost directly 
2 east. 
3 Number 33. Same perspective again, 
4 18 to 35 millimeter lenses. I just zoomed in that 
5 perspective to give you an idea what we were looking 
6 at farther down the street. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So you didn't actually 
8 walk closer to that scene? 
9 A No, ma'am. Just zoomed in from the 
10 previous perspective. 
11 Number 34, the first group of 
12 pictures were what we refer to as my overall photos 
13 of everything. Now is when I would typically start 
14 taking my individual photos of items of evidence. 
15 Q 
16 this, 34? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Okay. So can you describe what number is 
This is number 34, yes. 
What is this picture and why you took it? 
Okay. As a procedural thing, if I'm going 
20 to do my evidence in order, you can see now you will 
21 see the yellow evidence tents are placed down 
22 throughout the scene. In particular number one. In 
23 a perfect world, you would take a photograph of 
24 evidence number one, you move to number two, number 
25 three just to keep everything in order and that's

1 the order that we find things. There is not 
2 necessarily a rule or law that says the item that 
3 you see first has to be number one and everything 
4 has to go in order. 
5 It could very well, for instance, in 
6 this scene, if I marked number one and number three, 
7 or that's number two there, I could mark 1 through 
8 30 and then when we're getting ready to go find a 
9 shell casing on the other side of number one and 
10 have that be evidence item number 31. So it is not 
11 necessarily in the physical space things are 
12 numbered, they are numbered how we find them. 
13 Q So during the first series of photographs 
14 that we've seen and that was kind of your 
15 walk-through of the scene? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Did you take a break and then place 
18 placards in areas or were those placards visible in 
19 your earlier photographs? 
20 A No, they are not visible in the overall 
21 photographs. The overall photographs I take right 
22 after the video is done to show an overall view in 
23 pictures, not just video, of what the scene looks 
24 like when I arrived.

1 walk-through photographs. 
A Yes, ma'am. 2 
3 Q Is that when you then go through the scene 
4 and put placards down? 
5 A At that point I would walk through and 
6 placard items that I know our evidence. Things that 
7 are pointed out to me that were noted by the traffic 
8 cones first responding officers put down that they 
9 saw, and I would put my placards there on those 
10 pieces of items. 
11 During that time you may notice 
12 another shell casing or something else and, of 
13 course, we would placard that. Once those things 
14 are placard, we start taking our overall photos and 
15 close-up of each placard. 
16 Q These items that have a placard, and I 
17 think maybe you can see that that is number one 
18 there, does that correspond with your diagram where 
19 you have a number one with a circle on it? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
At this point after having documented 
22 these placards and you said you took measurements at 
23 a later time, those items that are numbered are 
24 depicted on the diagram? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct, on the diagram. All the little

1 bubbles you see, and that's not the best copy of it, 
2 but all the small circles that you see have a number 
3 inside of them denoting that item of evidence and 
4 its location at the scene. 
5 Q And then the legend that's attached to 
6 that diagram would tell you what number one is? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q Okay. And so number one here by the tire, 
9 of the front left tire of Darren Wilson's vehicle, 
10 what is that? 
11 A I don't have my list. I'm not sure, is it 
12 a bracelet?
