11 There is just enough of a 
12 gap that you could see the heavier set one's fist 
13 going up and down into the officer's face. 
14 MS. Okay. 
15 Or into the officer's body, 
16 put it that way because I didn't know where the 
17 officer was getting hit until after the officer got 
18 out. 
19 MS. All right. And so while this 
20 is going on, what's your reaction? 
21 At this time I was really

14 of his face and the gun was in his right hand, and 
15 he was wobbling from foot to foot and he looked 
16 confused, you know. He was kind of stumbling, or 
17 whatever, like he wasn't with it, does that make 
18 sense?

3 SUV. I did not see him go there, when I turned back 
4 to him he was already there.

16 mean, the shots kind of went boom, boom, four almost 
17 right in a row it seemed like, but then there was 
18 just enough of a pause and it was just, he wouldn't

10 MS. Okay. When did you tell him 
11 what happened? 
12 Almost immediately after 
13 because I gave him step by step instructions on how 
14 to get there and everything that happened. 
15 
16 
MS. What do you mean? 
I told him everything. And 
17 the first thing he said was, you know, better not 
18 tell nobody. 
19 MS. Why not? 
20 Because he doesn't want 
21 anybody to cause any problems for the 
22 MS. Why did you think your 
23 would have problems? 
24 By this time, I mean, this 
25 was because that happened Saturday, this would have

1 been Sunday, and by this time you already had death 
2 threats on whoever did it, I guess, is what he says. 
3 I don't know, we don't have cable. 
4 MS. You don't have cable, but do 
5 you have the internet? 
6 Yes. 
7 MS. Do you look at the news at all? 
8 I did for about the first 
9 week and then it drove me nuts and that's all there 
10 is. 
11 MS. Did you consider reporting what 
12 you saw to either St. Louis County or the FBI, it 
13 took you a while to come forward? 
14 It's been a long time. I 
15 didn't consider it, not really at first. 
16 MS. Why? 
17 Because I didn't want 
18 anything to do with it. In my opinion, and this is 
19 just my opinion, I felt like the officer does his 
20 job and it just kept going on, and on and on and on, 
21 and it was like. 
22 MS. Yeah, well, I guess this is my 
23 question. You said you were (inaudible) you know 
24 where the attention was? 
25 That is where I learned the

1 name and which one was which. 
2 MS. So not only was there a lot of 
3 attention nationally and all of that, there was 
4 actually riots going on and not far away from where 
5 you live, right? 
6 Yeah, I -- I knew, I heard 
7 about them. 
8 MS. My next question is right when 
9 you came in earlier, you know, from your dad to come 
10 in and do the right thing and that's why 
11 There is a difference. 
12 MS. All right. So explain it to 
13 us. 
14 You do what's right and 
15 that's what ultimately made me come in. But at the 
16 time I just, I mean, at the time I just didn't want 
17 to be in the middle of it. I still don't want to be 
18 in the middle of it. 
19 MS. I don't think nobody ever does 
20 no matter what the investigation, right, whether it 
21 gets media attention or not. But so -- so giving 
22 what you're saying where your dad, you know, tells 
23 you and all of that and doing the right thing, but 
24 you're saying it never even dawned on you to come in 
25 and report it?

1 I didn't say it didn't dawn 
2 on me, I mean, yeah, because it's, you don't get 
3 into the middle of an officer and his job. Do you 
4 know what I mean? Does that make sense? 
5 MS. I understand what you are 
6 saying, but yet 
7 That's what finally broke me 
8 was the fact that it just kept going and going and 
9 going. Every time you logged onto Facebook or any 
10 of the news websites, that's all there was. Nothing 
11 existed but Ferguson. 
12 MS. Okay. What prompted you to 
13 call St. Louis, that's what you did, right, you 
14 called St. Louis County too, right? 
15 Correct. 
16 MS. So what prompted you to call 
17 them? 
18 I actually called a few 
19 times before that and then I guess I made a comment 
20 that went too far. 
21 
22 
MS. What sort of comment? 
I have no idea. I called 
23 Clayton and made the comments, you know, about the 
24 situation.

1 comments? You don't have to tell me like word for 
2 word. 
3 Just that the officer had 
4 done his job and that, you know, he had been hit. I 
5 don't know word for word, because this is back in 
6 August. 
7 MS. So you called Clayton, you 
8 called Clayton where? 
9 From my cell phone. 
10 MS. Okay. Did you call the police 
11 department? 
12 Clayton nonemergency police 
13 department. 
14 MS. Okay. You did this how soon 
15 after the shooting? 
16 Probably within the first 
17 day or two, well, Tuesday, so one, two, I believe 
18 the first three or four days. 
19 MS. This is why I'm confused. 
20 Because first you are saying you didn't really 
21 consider reporting it, but yet you were calling 
22 information out and then commenting. So tell me 
23 what's going on 
24 But when I commented, I did 
25 not give them my name. I did not want anything to

1 do with it, it is a different type of violence, it 
2 is a different type of people. 
3 MS. What do you mean? 
4 The situation is scarry. 
5 MS. We are not judging you at all, 
6 we just need to know. 
7 It is not the environment 
8 that I grew up in. 
9 MS. What do you mean by that? 
10 It is just not the 
11 environment I grew up in. I grew up, you know, from 
12 
13 
the day I got 
there by 
at five. I grew up right 
and that's where 
14 I spent my whole childhood, 
15 It was just different, you know. 
16 I remember the day I got stopped for 
17 jaywalking when I was 13 and the officer threatened 
18 to turn me over my knee and take a belt to my rear 
19 end, and that was just the way times were back then. 
20 And we didn't dare tell them no, it was yes, sir, or 
21 we caught it, you know, we got it. If we got in 
22 trouble outside the house, we got in trouble inside 
23 the house for disrespecting our elders or something 
24 else. 
25 So to me up there it is just not --

1 MS. You don't think there is any 
2 repercussions for their actions, for anyone's 
3 actions. 
4 What do you mean? 
5 MS. Well, you said an officer 
6 stopped you for jaywalking and if you did something 
7 wrong, you respected it. But if you got in trouble 
8 there, you are getting in trouble at home. 
Right. 9 
10 MS. And you're saying that's 
11 different because people in North County don't have 
12 responsibilities for their actions? 
13 It is not so much North 
14 County as it is the times. 
15 MS. For anyone? 
16 The situation that I had 
17 witnessed is not the same as what it was, is not the 
18 environment that I live in. 
19 
20 
21 
MS. So you didn't want to tell us 
I didn't want anything to do 
22 with it, I still don't. I know it doesn't make any 
23 sense. I want to tell you because it is the right 
24 thing to do. I don't because I don't want to get in 
25 the middle of it.

1 MS. And you're not alone, that's a 
2 common feeling, like I said, for anybody that ever 
3 witness's something. You have to spend the time 
4 talking to police officers as well as prosecutors. 
5 You guys are nice, but you 
6 make me nervous. 
7 MS. I'm glad we are nice. Why do 
8 we make your nervous? 
9 Police make me nervous, and 
10 you are higher than the police, that makes me a 
11 little extra nervous. 
12 MS. We are trying to find out what 
13 your motivation might be. As prosecutors, 
14 especially, we have to try to figure out what kind 
15 of case we have, if we can put a case together. 
16 When we speak to witnesses, everybody has a reason 
17 why they say something whether they're telling the 
18 truth or they have other motivation behind it. 
19 So when we have somebody who is telling us 
20 what you are, takes you five weeks to come forward, 
21 we just want to understand what was going through 
22 yon in those five weeks. That means you ultimately 
23 say I am going to tell you who I am. 
24 Honestly, this may sound 
25 corny, but I did a lot of praying.

Page 142 
Okay. Tell us about that. 
2 That's different from what you are saying now to us, 
3 I didn't think about it, if you were praying about 
4 it, you were thinking about it. 
5 I did do a lot of praying, 
6 especially at night. And I had been staying up till 
7 3, 4, or 5 in the morning. And then I wouldn't be 
8 able to get up in the morning. 
9 MS. What would you dream about, 
10 what was your issue? 
11 Just going over what I had 
12 seen step by step every night and just asking, you 
13 know, I did go in and tell them this or I could go 
14 in and tell them that, and not really have to get 
15 involved. 
16 And then the next day I would pray and I 
17 would go like, I can't do that. Cause if I go in 
18 there and tell them what I seen, you're going to 
19 want to know everything. 
20 MS. So what were you concerned 
21 about telling us? 
22 Just, you know, I don't want 
23 to tell you any of it. 
24 MS. 
25

I mean, it was just praying

1 do I tell them that I seen it, or did a friend see 
2 it, or I don't know, I kept going back and forth. 
3 But when I pray, I'm not one of these, my ex-husband 
4 is Catholic. I'm not one of those, you know, the 
5 rosary and the cross and the holy water. You know, 
6 I lay in bed at night and stare at the ceiling and 
7 just talk. 
8 MS. Okay. What ultimately made you 
9 decide it was actually time to come forward? 
10 Just seeing my dad. Not 
11 seeing him physically, I mean, he's deceased. 
12 
13 
MS. Okay. 
Just remembering that he, 
14 you know, you do what, you do respect. That's it, 
15 end of the line. You can screw up in life, we're 
16 human, but you are to respect the law, you respect 
17 your elders, you were always to speak the truth and 
18 if you know something, then you are to come forward.

you talked to after this?
