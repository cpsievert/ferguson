3 Palms are up. 
4 All right. 
5 Nothing, I got nothing, I'm 
6 giving up. 
7 Okay. You say that they are 
8 about close to his shoulder and Detective 
9 says they are at about somewhat of an angle. And 
10 you say, what would you say, a 35 or 45 degree angle 
11 from the body. 
12 And you go on to say on page 18, he's 
13 standing there and he's looking, he's looking down 
14 at his body. And he looks up at the officer and you 
15 say, he looks up at the officer and by this time he 
16 was standing facing him after he turned around in 
17 this position. 
18 On page 19 you say, Detective asked 
19 you, Michael Brown is standing facing the officer at 
20 this point with his hands at his rib cage. So now 
21 his arms are further down, his hands are at his rib 
22 cage?

3 The first volley of shots? 
4 After the first volley of 
5 shots, his arms came down because he was staggering. 
6 Like he was coming, as he got hit like, oh, shoot, 
7 he was staggering around, all right. 
8 They had to come down a little bit, they 
9 were coming down. Like I said, when they weren't at 
10 his body, I didn't say they were next to his body. 
11 He asked me a question, I demonstrated and he said 
12 something that his narration is not what I showed, 
13 okay. 
14 The narration is not? 
15 Whatever he wrote, I don't 
16 know, he just stated, yes, but his depiction of what 
17 I said of what I showed him is incorrect. 
18 Let me just finish running 
19 through it, okay, and we can talk about it. 
20 Okay. 
21 Bottom of page 19, Detective 
22 says, Michael Brown is standing, facing the 
23 officer at this point with his hands at his rib 
24 cage. And you say, yeah.

1 up, and so they're at his rib cage, palms up. 
2 And then you say well, they weren't up 
3 against his rib cage, it was out because he was 
4 looking down, slightly away from his body. 
5 Uh-huh. 
6 And Detective says 
7 that he was looking down at his body at some point. 
8 And you say, right, right, uh-huh. 
9 And then you go on to say on page 20. 
10 Detective says, is anybody saying anything at 
11 this point? 
12 And you say the officer as he raised his 
13 head, he told him to stop. As Michael Brown raised 
14 his head, the officer told hold to stop; is that 
15 right? 
16 Right. 
17 And he says, as Michael 
18 Brown raises his head? And you said, as he raises 
19 his head, he says stop right there. He asked you, 
20 the officer says this? And your response was, yeah, 
21 he did say stop. And when he left from that fixed 
22 spot, then he was walking toward him. 
23 And he asked you, towards the officer? 
24 And you say, towards the officer. When he, as soon

3 you think he took before the officer fired? He 
4 said, big boy, he didn't take that many steps, I 
5 really couldn't count, yeah. 
6 And so that's the first volley that he has 
7 his hands down near his ribs at the time of the 
8 first volley? 
9 Right. 
10 Okay. I just wanted to make 
11 sure of that. That's why I wanted to ask you about 
12 this, sir. You know, there were three or four times 
13 where Detective , or you went back to when 
14 Michael Brown turned around and where his hands 
15 were. And on August 12th, I mean, there wasn't even 
16 any mention with him having his hands up with his 
17 palms facing the officer or all the way up. 
18 I didn't say, when he turned, 
19 his hands was up, he was looking down to see where 
20 he was hit. 
21 Uh-huh. 
22 His back was turned like 
23 this. As he was turning around, still looking, when 
24 he faced the officer, there they were.

3 On the 12th you only 
4 describe him as having his palms up toward the sky, 
5 right? 
6 No, I did not say that they 
7 were pointing up. I said, his hands were up like

11 no, no, I never said pointed up.

9 But consistently as it is 
10 described on August 12th, you have your palms up, 
11 right? And not facing towards the officer, but 
12 palms up, correct? 
13 Right. When he turned to 
14 face the officer, his hands were in this position. 
15 Okay. With his palms facing 
16 out, sir, or were the palms facing up? 
17 This is what I consider up. 
18 So you consider this up?

2 facing him, hands u like this is my hands palms 
3 facing the officer they weren't like this pointed 
4 towards the sky. They were pointed toward him. 
5 That's what I wanted to ask 
6 you is because on August 12th, I mean, you never 
7 said anything at any time about his palms actually 
8 facing the officer. 
9 I said his hands were up. I 
10 never said his palms were facing the sky. I said 
11 his hands were up, about shoulder length, arms out 
12 away from the body, that's what I said. I'm going 
13 to stick with that because that's what I saw. 
14 Before the first volley 
15 though, his hands were coming down towards his rib 
16 cage? 
17 Yeah, he was looking for 
18 them, he's still looking like. He's searching to 
19 see where he was shot. His arms were like this. 
20 All right. Now you have 
21 your palms sort of facing --

1 When he turned around and 
2 faced the officer, I'm going to say it again, this 
3 is what I saw. His hands was up shoulder length, 
4 palms facing the officer, not up toward the sky. 
5 That is my definition of palm, hands up, okay. 
6 Now, when the people down the street 
7 demonstrate they say hands up, they are like this.

13 No.

15 you were then demonstrating that after he turned

18 this is clear for the tape. If you don't agree with 
19 what I say, correct me, and I know that you will.

7 He had already stopped. He 
8 was looking, he was turning around, still looking. 
9 The officer said stop, he was turning. Okay. He's 
10 doing this, my back is to the officer. He is 
11 looking at his body like this. And just as he 
12 started turning, the officer said stop and he was 
13 still looking. 
14 And then he looked up, and when he was 
15 caught looking at the officer, his arm proceeded to 
16 go out like this. Palms away from, facing the 
17 officer, arms away from the body, palms facing in I 
18 give up stance, I give up. 
19 The officer again says stop. He wasn't 
20 moving, he took a step up. He stepped out on the 
21 street, his hands were still in the exact same 
22 position, palms facing up, arms away from the body 
23 and he shot him.

10 you said on August 12th is, he then takes a step or

12 Uh-huh. 
13 The officer was saying stop 
14 again.

16 And at the time of that 
17 first volley, his hands had come back down towards 
18 his rib cage where again he is looking to see if he 
19 had been shot. 
20 I have to say he already had 
21 them down. As he turned, he started to face the

12 left from that big spot that he was walking towards 
13 him.
