10 to hearing noises in the neighborhood, gunshots and 
11 to see that it was a police officer shooting at an 
12 individual running eastbound on my street was kind 
13 of like far fetch for me to believe.

15 eastbound and the officer was chasing him shooting 
16 after him? 
17 A It wasn't so much him chasing him, it was 
18 just gunshots going on. I seen Mike Brown running 
19 eastbound on my street.

1 was viewing the same thing I was viewing. And they

3 seen. It wasn't justifiable in my eyes and I didn't

Not at all, not at all. 
What in your mind is going on? 
I was discombobulated, I didn't know what 
13 was going on because I seen this individual, like I 
14 said, running eastbound on my street like what's 
15 going on. 
16 I didn't see, I didn't deem it to be 
17 a hostile situation to where the officer needed to 
18 of have had his gun raised at the level in which he 
19 had it at, you know what I'm saying? Facing Mike 
20 Brown. So I know that this sign is a sign of 
21 surrender. (indicating) 
22 Q And you clearly saw his hands raised above 
23 his head? 
24 A
