2 together, but we never have, but she --
3 Does she know at all about 
4 this, about the shooting? 
5 I didn't tell anybody except 
6 for my ex-husband. 
7 Why did you tell him? 
8 I had already told my 
9 ex-husband and he told me not to tell anybody and 
10 then I never told anybody after that. I mean, I 
11 live right next door to several county officers and 
12 I never told them either so. 
13 And , she went to high 
14 school with you? 
15 Correct. Not the earlier 
16 grades, it is whenever, I think they call them 
17 whenever they bring, you have no idea. 
18 So it would have 
19 been like 83, '84 when they started

1 correct? 
2 Correct. 
3 Was she the same year as you 
4 in school? 
5 Yes, but I had been held 
6 back a year, so technically she would have been a 
7 year younger. The way my birthday fell, I should 
8 have graduated when I was 17, but because I was held 
9 back in the first grade, I became 18. 
10 Okay. You mention you have 
11 her number at home? 
12 Correct. 
13 You have her email address 
14 also? 
15 At home, yes. 
16 You said you sent her an

18 Yes. 
19 Did you say anything in the

21 I emailed her the day I got

1 So can you describe again how 
2 you left the complex after the shooting? 
3 Yeah. When I left, I went 
4 first, second entrance, I went from here and went 
5 over this way. I don't know, I'd have to look at a 
6 map because I don't remember, you know, zigzag 
7 because I popped out in the third parking lot is how 
8 I popped out. 
9 You said something about a 
10 circle that you went around? 
11 Right, well, I went to the 
12 right and then I know I went to the left, and then I 
13 went down a bunch of different streets and I ended 
14 up on the street that went like this. 
15 Okay, a circle. 
16 But you can drive around it 
17 and if I remember correctly, it was a parking lot, 
18 like you can park, but you drive around it. And 
19 then there's some buildings right here and I turned 
20 that way and then I made a left and that street 
21 dropped me off on the side of QT. 
22 Here is the problem that we 
23 have. 
24 That's what I remember.

1 the apartment complex from the direction that QT WAS 
2 in, right? 
3 Right. 
4 And you pulled out of the 
5 lot and then you saw all of this? 
6 Well, I couldn't, I'm sorry, 
7 what? 
8 And you saw all of this that 
9 we've talked about, right. You go back to your car 
10 and then when you went to leave there, did you turn 
11 the opposite way of the way you came in or did you 
12 go back the way you came in? 
13 I couldn't go the way I came 
14 in. 
15 Why is that? 
16 It was blocked. 
17 From the police incident, 
18 the shooting incident? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
Right. Here is the building 
and the entrance and another, you know, you had the 
parking lot here and here, or whatever, and building 
right here. And the officer's car was here and the 
heavier set Brown was like here, there was no 
24 getting in and out of this parking lot.

1 the parking lot was past where the body was and 
2 where the police car was, so you had to go the 
3 opposite direction of the way you came in? 
4 Right, I had to go out, I 
5 popped out over here in this third parking lot. 
6 Uh-huh. 
7 Or whatever .. 
Okay. 8 
9 Well, you couldn't go in or 
10 out. You couldn't go back the way that you came 
11 into the apartment complex; is that right? 
12 I couldn't go back to the 
13 street QT was on, no. 
14 Okay, that's what I'm asking. 
15 So you couldn't go back the way that you came. So 
16 you went the opposite direction 
17 I went into the--
18 You went further into the 
19 complex? 
20 Correct. 
21 And then back there you were 
22 able to find a way out onto the street where QT is. 
23 Right, correct. 
24 And that was around a circle 
25 drive?

1 I remember the circle drive. 
2 I don't know all the different streets I took. 
3 Because I zigzagged through there for about 15 or 20 
4 minutes going up and down streets. I remember a 
5 couple that dead end into parking lots and you go 
6 down it and just dead end into a building, and then 
7 I would turn around and go back. 
8 You never came back there, I'm 
9 sorry. 
10 MS. I'm sorry, you said dead end 
11 into a building, what kind of building? 
12 Apartment building. If you 
13 go down and you make 
14 MS. How many story apartment? 
15 I don't even know. I just 
16 turned around. 
17 MS. It was at least two or three 
18 stories? 
19 I just turned around. I 
20 went down to that stop and I made a left and then I 
21 know I made the first left and that's where I 
22 couldn't go. Because I had to turn around and I 
23 went back and I went, I don't know where I went. 
24 MS. Was it all Canfield

1 At that point, yeah, they 
2 all look the same to me. I don't know, I just 
3 wanted out of there. But I didn't go back to the 
4 street that QT is on the same way I went. I ended 
5 up way over here. 
6 MS. I just want to explain to you 
7 a little bit, you understand that part of what we do 
8 here is we have to evaluate, you know, basically 
9 every statement a witness gives us, correct? 
10 
11 MS. 
Correct. 
So part of us doing that is 
12 just why we are going through that with you is just 
13 saying, okay, you were here and turned around and we 
14 know you were here. 
15 Because sometimes people will say how does 
16 she know what happened she actually was never there, 
17 she doesn't live in the area. What we are trying to 
18 establish right now is that you, in fact, were 
19 there, okay?

3 it wasn't the same way I came in. 
4 Our job as prosecutors, you

1 able to get out that way without going back the way 
2 you came? 
3 Correct. 
4 There is no way out that 
5 way, that's the thing. We've got investigators who 
6 have been up there plenty and know all of those 
7 streets and --
8 Yeah, there is because when 
9 you go around that thing, there is buildings and 
10 buildings and you go right through that parking lot. 
11 Uh-huh. 
12 And it pops out on a street 
13 that goes along the QT. 
14 MS. Right now, here is kind of a 
15 map of the area. I think that's the circle you are 
16 talking about, here is Canfield Drive, here is the 
17 way-- you can't get, there is a blockade here and 
18 there is a blockade there. The only way to get out 
19 once you go down this street is to go all the way 
20 down here. 
21 And it has been that way a long time, long 
22 before August 9th and it is that way today. You 
23 cannot get out through that circle.

4 Why do you hesitate about what 
she'd answer, what would you expect to say? 5 
6 Were you expecting? I don't 
7 know if she'll remember if she was actually, because 
8 it was nothing, we had her address, I told her I was 
9 going to try to stop by. You know, did she really 
10 expect me at a given time on that day? I don't 
11 know. But she will be able to tell you that she

8 My memory was affected by 
9 where I was standing because I remember standing in 
10 front of a building, with the parking lot and a 
11 parking lot and a fire hydrant across the street. 
12 But I kept, I remember being on the officer's 
13 driver's side. But I could not remember, you know, 
14 which parking lot or which way I went to get back to 
15 QT.

19 MS. 
Do you take medication? 
Not any more. I used to 
Do you take any sort of 
20 medication now that would affect your ability to 
21 remember things or --
22 No, no, I'm not on any 
23 medication, no. 
24 MS. Okay. One of the questions I 
25 have was the guy that you spoke to that you were

1 going to ask directions for, what did you say he was 
2 wearing? 
3 Heavy set, green shirt with 
4 braids. 
5 MS. Okay. So you know before 
6 had mentioned there were things we were having 
7 trouble kind of putting the pieces together and in 
8 your previous statement when you spoke to the guy 
9 you described this guy as wearing a, the same color 
10 wife beater shirt. 
11 That's what Dorian Johnson 
12 had on. 
13 MS. Okay. You also said that the 
14 guy that you were talking to was wearing that wife 
15 beater shirt. 
16 Okay. I don't, I know he 
17 had a green shirt and he was heavy set. 
18 MS. Okay. 
19 I might have talked to 
20 somebody else. 
21 The searches online that you 
22 may have seen, does this look familiar to you at 
23 all? Would you have seen that if you were 
24 searching, does that look familiar to you? 
25 Yes.

1 Okay. 
2 Because I was trying to 
3 figure out if that was the gold thing that I had 
4 seen. 
5 Okay. 
6 That's what I asked you before, 
7 right, that's what I was wondering if you used-- if 
8 you looked or used the article. 
9 I'm sorry. 
10 MS. Did you look online to remember 
11 things? 
12 Yes, yes, ma'am because I 
13 remember the gold thing and the officer's car. I 
14 remember it coming off, a gold thing coming off 
15 Dorian's right wrist and, yeah, I remember looking 
16 at this. 
17 Okay. So what did you search 
18 to get to that article? 
19 I have no idea, Mike Brown, 
20 Mike Brown shooting or Mike Brown shooting in 
21 Ferguson. 
22 I think I searched the name Darren Wilson 
23 a couple of times because I was trying really hard 
24 to figure out how

10 been through your account, obviously, especially the

12 here is the thing, I know there's so much been going 
13 in the community around here and people that just 
14 want to help in either way. And so I just need to 
15 ask, what you told us sounds a lot like what we have 
16 read in the newspaper. 
17 I haven't read any of that, 
18 I swear to God on a stack of Bibles, I looked at 
19 pictures to try to figure out which way I left the 
20 neighborhood and where I was parked. 
21 We know that you looked at that 
22 article that we just showed you because we just 
23 showed --
24 I looked at the picture, I 
25 swear, I swear I did not read any articles.

1 We know that you read articles, 
2 and that's fine. 
3 Well, no, like this, I know, 
4 yes, I looked at that, I looked at that multiple 
5 times because I was trying to figure out if that's 
6 the gold thing that I seen. 
7 What we are trying to 
8 determine here, and you're not in any kind of 
9 trouble. 
10 I swear I have not --
11 That's fine. You are not in 
12 any kind of trouble. What we need to be able to do 
13 out of fairness to you and out of all of the 
14 witnesses to this, okay, is just to be able to tell 
15 you is what you are telling us doesn't add up in 
16 with some ways, okay. 
17 Okay. 
18 And that's our concern. 
19 Listen, I know this has been all over the media, 
20 it's been all over the internet. And you talked 
21 before about how you did go back, and you know, it 
22 is human nature to want to go back and look at 
23 what's going on about this thing, okay. 
24 Right. 
25 Our concern is that maybe

1 you were very much sort of emersed in going through 
2 this on the internet, or whatever. And you're hear 
3 and you think you are trying to help, but maybe that 
4 you didn't see everything that you said that you 
5 saw, okay. 
6 And it is important for us to be able to 
7 determine who is telling us exactly what they say 
8 and who might have just seen some things and sort of 
9 put those together. 
10 I'm not 100 percent sure 
11 where I was parked. 
12 That's fine, we're not 
13 concerned about where you were parked. 
14 Refresh my memory on where I 
15 was parked and the MapQuest that you showed me, when 
16 you do get down and get close, I used that to help 
17 me figure out how I got out of there. 
18 Right, that's our concern is 
19 because on a map it looks like you could get out the 
20 way that you've described. 
21 I don't know how I got out. 
22 Yeah, I understand that. 
23 Those are details, okay. The point is are you 
24 100 percent sure that you were up there that day. 
25 That's our big question, okay. If you're not sure

1 about that, we just need to know that, all right? 
2 I was there that day, I just 
3 don't remember how I got in and how I got out. I 
4 don't remember, you know, I didn't hear words that 
5 were said or anything like that. I remember, can I 
6 look at this? 
7 MS. Yeah, go ahead. 
8 I remember looking at this 
9 because I was trying to figure out if that was the 
10 gold thing, what it was. And then I remember 
11 watching that a half dozen times. 
12 Did you comment on this 
13 article, did you send any comments? 
14 When this first happened, I 
15 made comments for the first few weeks. Some were 
16 really obnoxious, some were pretty vulgar and then I 
17 realized that that is not the Christian thing to do. 
18 You talking about actually 
19 typing comments? 
20 On Facebook. 
21 On Facebook, okay. 
22 What sort of comments did you 
23 make?

1 few times. I was not, I was having a hard time 
2 dealing with what I did see and trying to remember 
3 things that I knew I seen, but I couldn't remember. 
4 That's what we're worried 
5 about. It is understandable you said you have 
6 memory problems, if you are trying to fill in the 
7 gaps by using the internet and reading things, is 
8 that possible. 
9 That is possible. I know 
10 what I seen though, I know that I seen the 
11 altercation in the car and I know I seen the shot 
12 that killed him. 
13 But a lot of what you told 
14 us today you've actually had to fill in the blanks 
15 because your memory problems by looking at the 
16 internet. 
17 As far as where I park and I 
18 how I got in and out, yes. And where I was 
19 standing, I remember being in front of that building 
20 and the only thing I remember is there was a fire 
21 hydrant right across the street, that I do remember. 
22 MS. Did you notice any other cars 
23 in the area, any other people standing around? 
24 When I left over here, when 
25 I was over here, there was a really nice yellow car,

1 really nice. 
2 MS. It the parking lot or in the 
3 street? 
4 Half and half. It was like

MS. 
MS. 
Out of the third parking lot? 
Correct. 
I'm talking about in the 
10 area, a lots of people were in that area and you 
11 said you saw lots of people around, but other than 
12 that guy you were standing right next to as you are 
13 watching this scene unfold, did you see cars on 
14 either side of the street because it is noon, 
15 there's going to be cars there that want to come 
16 through. 
17 There was that and then over 
18 here there was a white car, I think it was a 
19 two-door and then there was that really nice yellow 
20 car. I remember thinking it was really sweet. 
21 MS. Right behind the white car, 
22 two-door car. 
23 No, I remember the yellow 
24 car being in the third parking lot. Like it just 
25 had pulled in.

1 MS. So the white two-door car, 
2 was that really close to where? 
3 There was another car there 
4 too because that entrance was blocked, I could not 
5 go out right away. 
6 MS. The third entrance? 
7 Correct. The white car with 
8 the two door --
9 this is something 
10 else I want to ask you about. These pictures here, 
11 neither of those are your car, right?

15 would that be your car?

17 car is that? 
18 What kind of car is yours?.
