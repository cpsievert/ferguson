3 talk about. Just seen somebody get shot, okay. I 
4 mean, it is tragic, but I didn't know him so I 
5 didn't have sympathy for what was going on. I felt

A No. 11 
12 Q Are you saying you didn't see it or you 
13 saying it didn't happen? 
14 A I'm saying if it did happen, it had to be 
15 after we pulled completely away from Canfield while 
16 we were there it did not happen. 
17 Q Okay. This is one of those things that 
18 always want to make sure to clarify when you say no, 
19 you didn't see it on anything. My question is, is 
20 that because it didn't happen or are you saying I 
21 just didn't see it or it could have happened, I just 
22 didn't see it. 
23 Was there ever a time in the van when 
24 you looked away or put your head down or ducked?

11 his arms and you said you couldn't see his hand, but 
12 did you see his body moving in any way or was he 
13 standing still? 
14 A He was just standing there. I don't think 
15 he was really moving like, nothing like that in 
16 front of the cruiser and then you see him take off 
17 running after the first two shots that's all I seen. 
18 Q All right. So now you're saying that you 
19 didn't want your mom to give the police your name, 
20 is that because you didn't want to be involved or is 
21 there another reason?
