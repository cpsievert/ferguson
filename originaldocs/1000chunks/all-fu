17 tested for except for the cannabinoids, correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
All right. So explain, Dr. , when you 
20 tested the blood and you were looking for positive 
21 or negative affects, explain the testing procedure 
22 or process that you used to get a negative or a 
23 positive reading? 
24 A See, we use a scatter approach. And that 
25 is we use what's called an immunoassay. An

1 immunoassay is an allergic reaction in a test tube 
2 to a class of compounds such as amphetamines, 
3 opiates, phencyclidine and so forth. What happens 
4 is we mix the sample with the antibody and if we get 
5 a reaction, then we know it is present or it is 
6 indicated as present. 
7 That has to go on for further 
8 confirmation, which in our case is always gas 
9 chromatography mass spectrometry. And what that 
10 does is give you molecular structure identification. 
11 The molecules introduced into the instrument, and 
12 chromatography means separation. So gas 
13 chromatography means separation at the gas phase. 
14 So what we'll do is separate out all 
15 of these compounds and then introduce them into the 
16 mass analyzer. The mass analyzer hits the molecule, 
17 sort of like my hand here, with very high energy 
18 causing it to explode and that gives you fingerprint 
19 identification. That's how we identify each of the 
20 drugs. We look to see the ions that are present, 
21 the ratios and so forth, other criteria that gives 
22 us the identification on that. 
23 That is also quantitive, telling us 
24 how much is present. So that's the one part. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
The other part is we run a gas

1 chromatography for the other drugs and this will 
2 pick up everything from strychnine to ectasy, and 
3 pick all of those up on one screen. And 
4 unfortunately, we have even seen strychnine cases. 
5 If I didn't like you, that's what I'd use. That's a 
6 nasty poison. 
7 Q Good to know. 
8 A If I can, what it does it causes 
9 constriction of all the muscles in your body. And 
10 your back can actually constrict to a point where 
11 you break your own back. Yeah, so it is nasty. But 
12 that screen will pick up everything. And again, all 
13 of that would have to go on for further 
14 confirmation. 
15 Q So your initial testing of the blood 
16 sample was the allergic reaction test that gives you 
17 an indication that the drug is present? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Now, did you, now, the gas 
20 chromatography

23 instrument that is used in the lab?

Yes. 
And this is an instrument that is used in

1 every laboratory in the country, is that fair to 
2 say? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Very well accepted as what it does and 
5 what it can do? 
6 A Absolutely. 
7 Q And the GCMS instrument that is in your 
8 laboratory, is it, do you check that on a regular 
9 basis to make sure that it is calibrated properly 
10 and giving you proper readings? 
11 A Yes. We run it through a whole series. 
12 We do what's called an auto-tune, which is a 
13 compound is entered into it and we have to see a 
14 particular fingerprint analysis. We then run 
15 standards, controls to make sure that the test is 
16 running properly. So everything is fully 
17 controlled. 
18 Q All right. And how often do you do those 
19 checks to make sure that the instrument is working 
20 properly? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Every time we run the instrument. 
How many samples at a time can this 
23 instrument run? 
24 A Probably about 50, but out of that 
25 10 percent are control samples, so run a control

1 periodically. 
2 Q And so out of the 40 that are not control 
3 samples, are these all 40 samples from the same 
4 subject? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
You might have John Doe's blood, you might 
7 have Michael Brown's blood, you might have Suzie Q's 
8 blood? 
9 A That's correct, there is no identification 
10 as to the person when it is going through the 
11 instrument. All we have is a number that's 
12 associated with a particular person. 
13 Q So how is it that you insure that these 
14 samples don't get mixed up? 
15 A Well, it is all done under chain of 
16 custody and everything is sequenced and when we load 
17 it into the instrument to check it and then the 
18 person who takes the data off checks the same 
19 sequence to make sure it's correct. And we also run 
20 the samples, well, not on marijuana. We only do the 
21 blood and urine ones. The other drugs are run 
22 differently. 
23 Q Okay. And so let's talk about the 
24 positive test that, positive result that you got for 
25 the cannabinoids, what is a cannabinoid?

Page 53 
1 A That's marijuana basically. Cannabinoid 
2 is the class of compounds, it's marijuana. 
3 Q All right. So once you received the 
4 positive for cannabinoids, did you then run the 
5 blood through the GCMS? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And when you ran the blood of Michael 
8 Brown through the GCMS, did you just check for 
9 cannabinoids or do you check for all these other 
10 drugs that you indicate was negative? 
11 A No, we specifically look for the 
12 cannabinoids. Delta-9, 11-Hydroxy and the carboxy. 
13 The reason for that is it is what's called a dwell 
14 time. It is how long the instrument gets to look 
15 for a particular compound. 
16 Because we are dealing with 
17 nanograms, which are basically a billionth of a 
18 gram. It is like you have a dollar, that's as close 
19 as you are to be being a billionaire, that's what we 
20 are looking for. 
21 So the instrument really has to focus 
22 in. We can do screens, but that's under a different 
23 criteria. For this we would just use, focus the 
24 instrument in on the cannabinoids. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
All right. And so when you ran the blood

1 sample of Michael Brown through the GCMS, did you 
2 get any quantitative information about, you had 
3 talked about Delta-9, hydroxy and the carboxy 
4 levels, did you get quantitive information about 
5 those? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And so let's talk about what is the 
8 difference between the Delta-9, hydroxy and carboxy. 
9 And for everybody's clarification, the Delta-9, is 
10 Delta-9-THC on your report, correct, and the hydroxy 
11 is 11-Hydroxy-THC. And then the carboxy, which is 
12 what we are calling it, is actually 
13 11-NOR-Delta-9-COOH, correct? 
14 A Yes. 
15 
16 
Q And so is that COOH the carboxy? 
A Yes. 
17 Q Okay. So it doesn't say carboxy, that is 
18 what we are referring to, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
When we talk about carboxy. So can you 
21 explain to the grand jurors, what are these 
22 compounds and how are they different? 
23 A Okay. The first compound, the Delta-9, is 
24 the reason you smoke marijuana. That produces the 
25 desired affects, the euphoria.

1 When it is in your body your body 
2 looks at it as a foreign substance. So it starts to 
3 metabolize or alter it chemically. One of the 
4 things it forms is the 11-Hydroxy-THC. 
5 This is also a psychoactive compound, 
6 but rarely do we find it because it is so short 
7 lived in the human body. And then it goes on 
8 further to be metabolized into the carboxy. We call 
9 it carboxy because the full name for it is 
10 11-NOR-Delta-9-Tetrahydro-Cannabinoid-Carboxylic 
11 acid.

13 carboxy.

15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Which I can't say so we will call it 
That's why we call it carboxy. 
Okay. 
And that's the final metabolite. That's 
17 the compound you hear, well, if you smoke a joint, 
18 you can test positive for a month, which isn't true, 
19 but that's what you hear. 
20 Q So does, so you explained that the 
21 Delta-9-THC has a psychoanalytic effect? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Psychoactive. 
Psychoactive. So that's what makes people 
24 feel differently when they smoke marijuana?

1 Q And then the Hydroxy-THe, does that have a 
2 psychoactive effect on the human body? 
3 A Yes, it does. But as I said, we rarely 
4 find it. Only in a very, very acute use with death 
5 following. 
6 Q And then on the 11-Hydroxy molecule. 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q Is there a psychoactive effect on the body 
9 for that? 
10 A No, you could eat a pound of it, it 
11 wouldn't do anything. 
12 Q Okay. So why is it that these, why is it 
13 that it is important to test for all three of these 
14 compounds when you are testing the cannabinoids? 
15 A Well, for example, suppose you only had 
16 the Delta-9 and nothing else, that would raise 
17 severe questions about the sample. You want to see 
18 the parent drug, the 11-Hydroxy right off, you know 
19 it is not going to be there, and you want to see the 
20 Carboxy-THe. That tells you the drug was consumed 
21 by the individual and it was being metabolized. 
22 So you have a good handle on its use 
23 and one verifies the other. Much the same as we do 
24 in a tube biologicals like blood and urine. The 
25 reason for that is it avoids any question was it

1 contaminated or mixed up. 
2 If we find it in the blood, we want 
3 to find it in the urine because one validates the 
4 other. 
5 Q Okay. And so in this testing, going off 
6 what you said there, you ran the sample of urine 
7 that you had received from Michael Brown that was 
8 received from Michael Brown. You ran those same 
9 three for those three compounds. Delta-9, hydroxy 
10 and the carboxy, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So let me ask you because we can see from 
13 your report that you, when you ran this through the 
14 GCMS you got for the Delta-9-THC, you got 12 
15 nanograms per milliliter. Yet when you ran the 
16 urine you got negative for the Delta-9-THC? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Isn't that inconsistent, why would that be 
19 different? 
20 A No, well, the Delta-9-THC is subject to 
21 other things particularly in the urine. It can even 
22 bind up to the plastic in the container, the urinary 
23 excretion due to dilution. Any one of a number of 
24 things can cause the urine to be negative for the 
25 Delta-9.

1 If it was negative for the carboxy, 
2 that would be a real concern, but not for the 
3 Delta-9. 
4 Q Is the fact that the blood was 12 
5 nanograms per milliliter and the urine was negative, 
6 does that tell you anything about the recency the 
7 drug may have been ingested? In other words, I 
8 assume the urine is the final process of the body, 
9 processing the substance, correct? 
10 A The urine serves to get rid of chemicals 
11 in your body, okay. That's probably the main group. 
12 What you are looking at, the urine really doesn't 
13 count as far as the interpreting it. The Delta-9 in 
14 the blood tells you because Delta-9 in the blood 
15 only hangs around for a short period of time, like 
16 maybe two hours. It has a relatively short half 
17 life. It is in, produces its affects, the affects 
18 last longer in the presence of the Delta-9, but when 
19 you have it in there it goes to acute use, that's 
20 within a couple of hours. 
21 Q Okay. So, and you also had mentioned that 
22 depending upon the sample that in the urine, the 
23 urine sample could be diluted? In other words, 
24 there could be more water in the urine or other 
25 liquids or chemicals?

Page 59 
1 A Yes, it depends on the location of the 
2 urine, how the kidneys were functioning, what's 
3 going on in the body and there is a lot of variables 
4 there. That's why you can't interpret urine 
5 concentration as far as impairment, you just don't 
6 know. 
7 Q Okay. So then the next chemical or 
8 compound was the hydroxy, which was negative when 
9 you tested it in the blood, but it was greater than 
10 25 nanograms per milliliter when you tested it in 
11 the urine? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Why is that not inconsistent? 
The urine serves to collect and 
15 concentrate waste products. The body looks at 
16 metabolites, and actually the Delta-9 is waste 
17 product it wants to get rid of it. 
18 Q So can you draw any conclusions about the 
19 time or the recency of the ingestion of the THC 
20 based upon the fact that the hydroxy was negative in 
21 the blood and yet greater than 25 nanograms in the 
22 urine? 
23 A Well, that alone would put it within ten 
24 hours because you find it in the urine, but a short 
25 half life, maybe a little less than that. So really

1 it wouldn't narrow it down very much. The Delta-9 
2 in the blood is the key. 
3 Q And then your, the levels that you 
4 detected in the urine for the hydroxy, as well as 
5 the Delta-9-Carboxy, those are quantified as greater 
6 than so many nanograms, is that a cutoff level that 
7 the lab has? 
8 A In our quantitation, we run a series of 
9 standards going up the long. Okay. If it exceeds 
10 our upper limit, we just report it as greater than 
11 because it is an academic number. 
12 Q Okay. So there's no conclusion that you 
13 could draw then that if it is greater than 25 
14 nanograms, we can't say that. Well, then it was, 
15 could have been 100 nanograms, which would be four 
16 times any level? 
17 A You can't say anything based on a urine 
18 concentration for THC. 
19 Q Okay. And so then let's talk about then 
20 the testing, you mention the carboxy level in the 
21 blood that you found. And you also said that you 
22 would be concerned if you did not have carboxy if 
23 you had a positive for the Delta-9-THC, but no 
24 carboxy that would be problematic? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, that would be inconsistent.

1 Q So in this case you detected 45 nanograms 
2 per milliliter of the carboxy in the blood of 
3 Michael Brown, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q And is that, can you draw any conclusions 
6 from that the fact that it was also present in the 
7 urine or the fact that it was 12 nanograms that the 
8 THC, Delta-9THC was 12 nanograms per milliliter and 
9 the carboxy was 45 nanograms per milliliter. Can 
10 you draw any conclusions about the time of the 
11 ingestion of the THC from that? 
12 A Well, not from the urine, no, but as I 
13 said, from the blood THC, yes. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A That is really a hard marker for a couple 
16 of hours. The urine can easily test positive for a 
17 couple of days for the Carboxy-THe. And if you are 
18 smoking like a rastafarian type stogey, it can go 
19 longer. 
20 Q Can you tell anything from your findings 
21 about the, about the, I don't know how to phrase 
22 this, about how often the person may have ingested 
23 THC? In other words, would numbers look different 
24 if you were testing a sample from a chronic 
25 marijuana user, somebody that smoked daily, maybe

1 multiple times a day? 
2 A You can't tell the difference between an 
3 acute dose and a chronic dose in one snapshot. 
4 Q When you say acute dose, in your lingo 
5 acute means? 
6 A Say within a couple of hours versus 
7 somebody who smokes every day for a month or two. 
8 Q Okay. So from your findings you can't 
9 conclude that Michael Brown was a chronic marijuana 
10 user versus perhaps this was just an acute dose. In 
11 other words, something that was taken within a 
12 couple of hours prior to his death? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 Q Okay. Now, the 12 nanograms per 
15 milliliter for the THC, you stated that that is the 
16 compound that makes people feel the affects of 
17 marijuana? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
How would you describe, or what do you 
20 conclude from that finding that there were 12 
21 nanograms per milliliter in his blood? 
22 A The Delta-9 is psychoactive, that means it 
23 has an affect. So when you have a drug that is 
24 psychoactive in your blood stream, it is having an 
25 affect.

1 You can argue, well, more effect, 
2 less effect, you can argue that yes, but it is 
3 definitely having an affect on you. When you start 
4 looking at it in terms of the overall, well, 
5 marijuana generally, you know, you smoke a joint and 
6 you chill out, that's generally what happens. Okay 
7 does that have to happen? No, it doesn't. There is 
8 a lot of other variables that are associated with it 
9 that depends on your basic chemistry, your basic who 
10 you are as it were. 
11 So that it can have somewhat 
12 different affects. Add to that the question of 
13 dose. If you take, take alcohol. You have a glass 
14 of wine with dinner, okay, or whatever with dinner, 
15 that's one way of doing it. 
16 You are getting the drug, it is 
17 psychoactive, it is having an affect on you. Now 
18 instead you have a quart with dinner, a quart of 
19 scotch. Well, that's going to produce a very 
20 different effect. It is a function of the 
21 concentration, how much goes in you. 
22 Same thing is true with marijuana. 
23 You can get desirable affects one level, but if you 
24 get a massive dose, and you have to remember 
25 marijuana is not regulated. So you don't know the

1 purity you are getting. You don't know if you are 
2 getting Illinois ditch-weed or Acapulco Gold, for 
3 lack of a better example, okay. So it could be very 
4 low purity or very high purity. 
5 Again, the same thing can happen. It 
6 is like having a glass of wine with dinner versus a 
7 bottle of scotch. You can get very different 
8 affects depending on how much you use. 
9 Q Is there also a variable that would 
10 perhaps effect how it was felt by the person 
11 depending on their body mass or their weight? So, 
12 in other words, if a smaller, we know this to be 
13 true with alcohol, a smaller person can have a glass 
14 of alcohol and a larger person maybe twice or three 
15 times the size can have the same amount of alcohol 
16 and the smaller person's blood alcohol level will be 
17 higher, you would expect it, would that be correct? 
18 A Yes. See, marijuana is technically 
19 classified as a hallucinogen. Cause what it does is 
20 it alters your perception of your surroundings. How 
21 you see things, okay. What information comes into 
22 your mind. It slows it down and distorts it. That 
23 is why it is classified as hallucinogen. 
24 Technically speaking, I mean, you are 
25 not look at pretty birds and flying snakes and so

1 forth, but you are altering your perception of 
2 senses. That's a function of dose. So the more you 
3 have in you, the more effect you can get out of it. 
4 Some people, for example, with 
5 marijuana, it is bound up to nonspecific fat sites. 
6 So if you smoke a joint the first time, you don't 
7 really get a good buzz out of it. The reason for 
8 that is the drug is binding up to nonspecific fat so 
9 it is not hitting your brain, it is not giving you 
10 the effect. 
11 After a couple of times these 
12 nonspecific sites are filled. So the drug is now 
13 free, it gets to your brain and produces, gets to 
14 the threshold and starts producing the effect. 
15 The more you have, the greater the 
16 effect, and it becomes variable at high end. So if 
17 you have, take a mil of highly concentrated 
18 Delta-9THC, that will give you a completely 
19 different effect in smoking a joint. A lot of the 
20 studies they have even done with injections. They 
21 can't really, with alcohol it is straight line 
22 depressant. That just means the more you drink, the 
23 more it depresses you. I don't mean sad, I mean 
24 your nervous system. It slows it down, stops it 
25 from working, makes you goofy, okay.

3 As you go up from there, if you take a massive dose, 
4 you can get significantly different affects. Those 
5 affects that are not generally associated with 
6 marijuana. 
7 Q So we've discussed a little bit last week, 
8 Sheila and I had a long conversation with you as 
9 well this morning, I spoke with you, we talked about 
10 the affects that you might see or experience, a 
11 person might experience if they were ingesting THC. 
12 And starting with euphoria being the feeling of 
13 happiness or well being, perhaps?

A 
Q 
Yes, you are feeling about. 
That's kind of like the chill, right? 
Yes. 
And then the next one perhaps could be 
Yeah. 
And that's when you don't really feel like 
21 you have the energy to get up and you're just going 
22 to lay around?

You don't do things. It is amotivation. 
After that would be a possible paranoia? 
Yes.

And then would there be hallucination? 
It is possible to go to a full-blown 
3 hallucination, yes. 
4 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Paranoia and psychotic episodes. 
So when we talked about, you had mentioned 
7 when we talk about hallucinations, it doesn't mean 
8 the person sees pink elephants. It means that 
9 they're not perceiving reality the way it is, 
10 correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. And so if you have a massive dose 
13 of THC, could you experience the hallucination 
14 and/or the psychosis if you had a high enough dose 
15 of THC? 
16 A If you got a high enough dose, you could 
17 have a psychotic episode into hallucinations, yes. 
18 Q Now, in this particular case when you 
19 tested the blood and you got 12 nanograms per 
20 milliliter for the Delta-9-THC, do you consider that 
21 a high dose? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Okay 
What conclusions did you make from that? 
Well, you have to put things in 
25 perspective. This was a very large individual, I

Page 68 
1 think he was about 300 pounds. So for concentration 
2 of 12 nanograms in a large person, that shows it was 
3 a large dose. 
4 In a small person, say like 
5 100 pounds to get to 12 nanograms wouldn't take a 
6 lot. A single joint could easily do that. But when 
7 you talk about a larger body mass, just like 
8 drinking alcohol, larger persons can drink more 
9 alcohol because they have the receptacle to hold it. 
10 Q Now, let's compare, because I think most 
11 of us probably have had the experience of consuming 
12 alcohol and over time feeling the affects of 
13 alcohol. And, you know, so, for example, one of the 
14 things that I think we all can probably relate to is 
15 that, for example, if I were to consume a certain 
16 amount of alcohol and my mother who doesn't drink 
17 might consume the same amount of alcohol, we have 
18 the same body mass, she may experience different 
19 affects than I might because I have experienced 
20 drinking alcohol. 
21 Now, some people call that tolerance, 
22 is there any similar effect from people that are 
23 used to using marijuana, could they have the same 
24 levels in their system but experience different 
25 feelings?

1 A Well, of course different people with the 
2 same concentration can experience different 
3 feelings. But see, with marijuana, like your 
4 example was the correct straight line depressant. 
5 With marijuana it's the reverse. So the person who 
6 is naive will get much less affects than a person 
7 who has been using it and that's due to the non 
8 specificity of binding sites. 
9 Q So based upon your finding that there were 
10 12 nanograms of THC, 12 nanograms per milliliter of 
11 Delta-9-THC in Michael Brown's blood, first off, can 
12 you make any conclusions from your findings within a 
13 reasonable degree of toxicology certainty or as to 
14 the recency in which he may have ingested the THC? 
15 A Yes, it is within a couple of hours, maybe 
16 two, three hours on the outside. 
17 Q Can you make any conclusions or do you 
18 have an opinion as to the dose that Michael Brown 
19 may have ingested based upon your tests and your 
20 test results? 
21 
22 
A Given his large body mass, yes. It would 
have been a very significant dose. It wouldn't be 
23 just toking on like a simple joint. 
24 Q Now, based upon your testing and your 
25 conclusions, can you make any conclusions about the

Page 70 
1 level of impairment that Michael Brown may have 
2 experienced if, before he passed? 
3 A I can't tell you how he was impaired. It 
4 is like predicting what somebody would do. I can't 
5 tell you that. I can tell you that the drug is 
6 present at a significant concentration that 
7 represents a large dose into Mr. Brown. 
8 How he would have behaved and what he 
9 would have done I cannot predict. I know the drug 
10 was having an affect and was impairing his nervous 
11 system. 
12 Q You would consider he was impaired in some 
13 way? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q But you cannot draw any conclusions that 
16 he was suffering or that he was experiencing 
17 hallucinations or having a psychotic break? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Urn, we discussed when we came out to talk 
20 to you last week, we also discussed with you, we 
21 asked you if you were familiar with the process 
22 called waxing? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q And you indicated that you were familiar 
25 with what that is?

Page 71 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q Can you describe for the grand jurors what 
3 you understand waxing to be and what happens? 
4 A Waxing is a process of concentrating the 
5 Delta-9 present in marijuana. It uses gases like 
6 butane and basically it extracts the Delta-9 out of 
7 the marijuana and it is in a highly concentrated 
8 form. So you get a lot more bang for the buck out 
9 of it. 
10 Q So you can ingest a smaller piece or 
11 smaller physical quantity and get a more 
12 concentrated level of THC? 
13 A A much greater effect, yes. 
14 Q Okay. And is there any difference if you 
15 ingest a much higher concentration of THC, is there 
16 a difference in how quickly you would feel those 
17 affects or how long it would last? 
18 A Well, it would depend at that point if you 
19 were inhaling it, putting it under your tongue, 
20 smoking it, however you were doing it. But 
21 generally speaking, it is less than ten minutes. 
22 Q And less than ten minutes for you to feel 
23 the affects or it would last less than ten minutes? 
24 A No, for you to feel the affects. The 
25 affects would come within ten minutes.

THC, do you have any opinion as to how

Probably four to five hours. 
Now, this morning we talked about, and we 
7 did also briefly last week talk about levels of THC 
8 that would indicate or that legally would indicate 
9 someone is presumed impaired. 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q Now, states such as Colorado and 
12 California, are you familiar, are you aware that 
13 those states have legalized marijuana either 
14 medically or in the case of California 
15 recreationally or Colorado, correct? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And we discussed the fact that those 
18 states have made determinations as to the level that 
19 they would if they detect in the person's blood that 
20 would indicate impairment much in the same way that 
21 alcohol level of .08 is presumptively in most 
22 states, in the State of Missouri you are presumed 
23 impaired. 
24 Are you aware of the level that 
25 Colorado and California have set for them to presume

Q 
A 
Q

What is that? 
5 nanograms per mil. 
So in this case, Michael Brown's level was 
6 over twice that; is that correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q But again, you're not, and the same thing 
9 with actually the consumption of alcohol, it impairs 
10 people, but their affects might be different 
11 depending on some of the factors that we've talked 
12 about? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Urn --
15 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any further 
16 questions right now. Sheila, do you have any 
17 questions for Dr. ? 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Regarding the waxing, if 
19 Michael Brown ingested through the waxing method 
20 that you discussed, would the butane appear in his 
21 body? 
22 A No. Butane is so volatile, if I squirted 
23 it here on the desk, talked to you and go back, it's 
24 gone. So it is extremely volatile. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. WHIRLEY: And in this case, was he

1 actually checked to see if butane was in his brain? 
2 A Yes, that's part of our routine. We would 
3 check for volatiles such as butane, other inhalants. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Obviously, it didn't 
5 appear it is so volatile or whatever. There is no 
6 way to know whether or not he participated in waxing 
7 or not, there is no evidence? 
8 A Not based on our testing, that is correct. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I'm not sure of 
10 everything Kathi asked. I will open it for the 
11 jurors. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to real quickly 
13 be clear, you cannot say, you're not saying, I'm 
14 assuming you're not saying that Michael Brown was 
15 hallucinating or suffering a psychotic break, there 
16 is no way to know that; is that correct? 
17 A I can't say that based on our testing, 
18 that is correct. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: But based upon the levels 
20 that you tested or that you got in your testing, you 
21 consider that this dose was within two to three 
22 hours and it was a large dose of THC?

1 question about a person's hydration level, how that 
2 affects the test. Either prior to or even in this 
3 incident the individual on the street in August for 
4 four plus hours, do you know how that may effect the 
5 result in any way, if it would? 
6 A Okay. What you are looking at there is an 
7 alteration between the water and the fat in your 
8 body and you are depleting the water, so the fat 
9 becomes a hire percentage. Not a lot of difference 
10 because we lose too much water, you have electrolyte 
11 imbalance, you have a heart attack and die. So 
12 there is a difference on that. 
13 On a drug like marijuana where it is 
14 highly lepid soluble, fat soluble, it would just 
15 have more, it would soak up more of it. That's all 
16 it would do. So it really wouldn't alter much of 
17 anything. 
18 
19 
20 
A Yes. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Dr. , with 
21 reference to the psychotic affects of certain types 
22 of drugs, specifically THC. Can you explain to me, 
23 trying to think how to phrase this. For someone who 
24 is at a certain level, you mention that if they 
25 smoked for a month at a time or two weeks at a time,

1 they can build up a certain level in their body. 
2 Can a massive dose at any particular point produce 
3 an entirely different affect than what a person is 
4 used to, you know what I'm saying? 
5 A Yes. 
6 It is kind of hard to 
7 explain. If somebody who smokes is used to a 
8 certain type of reaction out of a level of THC, all 
9 of the sudden you see a spike in the quantity of it, 
10 what potentially could happen. Is it something that 
11 could be totally different? 
12 A Yes. See, what you are looking at is like 
13 a steady state so that using the drug on a regular 
14 basis. Then you get a massive dose, it jumps up and 
15 you can switch over into complete toxicity. Most of 
16 the drugs behave that way that you are stable and 
17 then it jumps up. 
18 Some drugs, like a couple of the 
19 amphetamines. You can take the same dose today, 
20 tomorrow, then you take it the next day and it's 
21 lethal. Those are the real dangerous drugs. 
22 Marijuana is not like that. So your point is well 
23 taken. You are stable and you have a massive dose 
24 you are going to get a big difference in the affects 
25 and could be completely different.
