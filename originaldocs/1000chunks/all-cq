Q 
Yes. 
She's not; is that correct? 
Yes, that's correct. 
Okay. And so when you first, something 
10 drew your attention, there were three things that 
11 all happened kind of at the same time. The tires 
12 squealing and your phone ringing? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yeah. 
And gunshots, which originally you said 
15 three shots is what you heard, is that how you 
16 remember it today? 
17 A I remember hearing a couple of shots, two 
18 or three, yes. 
19 Q Okay. A couple of shots, does that mean 
20 two or does it mean two or three? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
It could have been two or three. 
Okay. And so when you looked out, is this 
23 the window you first looked out? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that's your bedroom?

21 will be in there forever and I'm sorry we have to 
22 ask you this many detailed questions. It is 
23 probably something you don't want to have to think

7 Canfield in an unmarked police vehicle. Were you in 
8 his car or in a police car when you made this 
9 statement? 
A I was in a car. 10 
11 Q Okay. So now you've given some 
12 information about your phone number and so forth. 
13 And then you start talking to him around page three 
14 about the fact that your boss was going to pick you 
15 up. She was going to pick you up and she was headed 
16 towards me, do you see that? 
A Yes. 17 
18 Q And then you said here on page three, at 
19 the moment I heard a car tire skirrr, like skirrr, 
20 like it hurried up and pulled over. At the same 
21 time she called me to come outside cause I was 
22 waiting on her. 
23 So I saw her, so I looked out the 
24 window and I saw the police. And the first thing I

9 Right behind those officers. 
10 So you are talking about where you 
11 see right? She's in the Do you 
12 see where I'm leading you down the page? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And she's sitting in her van, yes. Okay 
15 what happens then. Okay. So she witnesses 
16 everything from behind, but I witness it from the 
17 top. 
18 You are on the third floor, right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I looked outside and saw the police the

1 you where you were looking outside, top floor, 
2 second, I'm sorry, third floor. He's trying to 
3 clarify where you are, okay. 
4 And then it says here, you're looking 
5 out the window, right? No, this one. You are 
6 pointing to him where the windows are, right? 
7 Facing towards the police car. 
8 So you are talking about what you 
9 knew. And then you get back to, cause I heard the 
10 skirrr, and I just assumed it was her and she was 
11 calling me. So I was going to grab my things to 
12 come outside to go to work. 
13 He says, okay. And then you say, so 
14 at the moment where, I mean, before I did, I just 
15 looked outside to make sure she was, it was her 
16 waiting for me and I saw a police officer. 
17 I don't know name running toward this 
18 guy. I didn't see the hassle at first, but I did 
19 see him get out of the car and run in a hurry. 
20 The guy was, oh, I'm sorry. I can't 
21 remember his name, but it was a friend of a friend 
22 of mine and , I think you are talking about, 
23 are you talking about Dorian at that point? 
24 A No, I was talking about, they keep telling 
25 me I knew

1 Q So that is actually not 
2 isn't it? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Okay. So he ran and so at that time I 
5 came from that window and I ran to the patio right 
6 there. I open the blinds and I could see past this 
7 corner, so I could see directly there from the 
8 blinds. 
9 So there I saw the man running, I 
10 kept hearing some gunshots. The lady's window 
11 across the apartment complex from mine, her window 
12 got shot cause steady shots fired. 
13 So you're talking about the first 
14 thing you see is the officer get out of his car and 
15 run. And you also mention that I didn't see the 
16 hassle at first. 
17 A Yeah, when I was mentioning that, they was 
18 saying stuff was going on inside a police car and a 
19 lot of stuff. And I was trying to let him know that 
20 before the tires screech, I didn't see anything that 
21 they were doing before that happened. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
They said there was stuff going on, and 
24 everybody was talking about it and so I did not see 
25 those things that they said.

1 Q Oh, okay. So on page 7, again, we're 
2 talking about how many gunshots do you think you 
3 heard and I think that this is initially, okay. 
4 Well, I've heard three at first. Like as soon as I 
5 heard the skirrr, I heard three gunshots, boom, 
6 boom, boom. And then I came to the window and 
7 before I could exit my house from the balcony to the 
8 actual door, is when I kept hearing more and more 
9 shots. 
10 So I was technically trying to say 
11 behind, stay behind the door, which is why I could 
12 see, urn, him getting shot, but I wasn't present for 
13 the video to be show cause I was all, I was inside, 
14 okay. 
15 And then he asked you some questions 
16 about he wants to understand what you are saying. 
17 So you look out of that far window and there's 
18 s car, right? Right. 
19 And what do you see at that point? 
20 And I saw the man, I'm sorry, by the 
21 man, I mean the police officer getting out of his 
22 car and running full speed. 
23 So again, when he's asking you, you 
24 look out the far window, you see s car, at 
25 what did you see at that point? I saw a man

2 A That's what I saw. 
Grand Jury Volume IX 
October 2, 2014 
Page 44 
3 Q Okay. So if you want to look through 
4 this, I can let you, but I don't recall you ever 
5 telling the police in your interview on the 9th that 
6 you saw anything happen between the officer and 
7 Michael Brown at the car? 
8 A And I didn't make that recollection like 
9 that at first. I have to sit down and think and 
10 process everything that had just happened to me. 
Q And certainly that's understandable 11 
12 because, as I said, you're years old, you've just 
13 witnessed something that hopefully none of us ever 
14 have to see. And I know you were emotional at the 
15 time. 
16 Do you they think it's possible that 
17 that initial recollection was that you didn't see 
18 anything at the car and it was only until after 
19 people were talking to you about it then you started 
20 to think that maybe you saw what happened at the 
21 car? 
22 A No, I know that because I didn't make the 
23 recollection because I didn't know those were the 
24 same people -- person I was seeing. I know that I 
25 hadn't seen Dorian before, I saw him by the 2-door

11 tape around it, that's the officer's car, correct?

14 here and where you live right there, right?

12 a window because you can open it and see out of it, 
13 but yes, it is my sliding glass door.

15 floor is, there's a window and you said that's one 
16 of your bedroom windows, correct?

8 out until after Michael Brown's been shot, correct? 
A Yes. 9

11 to this window, you stay at that window until after 
12 Michael Brown's been shot, correct? 
A Yes. 13 
14 Q And so wouldn't you agree if people were 
15 running in this direction and if things are moving 
16 in this direction, this wall is going to block what 
17 you are seeing, isn't it?

20 have been able to see? 
21 A Yeah, that's true.

No, is it like your family room, kitchen?

And you also said in your statement to the

22 were talking about that and I was just saying the 
23 tire mark screech and this is where I heard the car 
24 at and where I saw the car, and where the bullet hit 
25 the wall and stuff like that.

1 Q And you said in your statement to the FBI 
2 that you had made, you had written down everything 
3 that you had scene shortly afterwards. How long 
4 after it happened did you write everything down? 
5 A Right before or right after I got my 
6 attorney. So that wasn't long at all, that was 
7 within a week or two weeks of it happening, a week 
8 or two weeks, maybe not even that long. 
9 Q And then when they asked you about that 
10 statement, you said that you burned it? 
11 A No, I didn't burn it, I got rid of it, I 
12 threw it away. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
You threw it away? 
Yeah. 
Why did you throw it away? 
Because I become really paranoid. Every 
17 day I came home there was a different reporter on my 
18 door and everybody knew where I lived at. And I 
19 couldn't get one sense of peace at all. 
20 So I was getting calls, my family was 
21 getting calls, every day they would come to my door. 
22 I started to get paranoid they are going to find 
23 this and use this. I got this really bad paranoid 
24 feeling, the whole thing was sick to my stomach. I 
25 got rid of everything that I had wrote down.

1 Q Why didn't you just give it to your 
2 attorney? 
3 A Because she didn't, she had already been 
4 listening to me, she didn't need it. She was there 
5 when I wrote some of it. 
6 Q So she knew that you had made a written 
7 recollection of this?

it? 
Q 
A 
Q

Did she ever read it? 
I'm pretty sure I let her read it, yeah. 
Do you know if she might of made a copy of 
Oh, no, she didn't. As a matter of fact, 
15 I don't know if I was reading it to her, but I 
16 remember her knowing about it, the little phrases, 
17 I'm sorry, like on a little note pad thing. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
That was the first one I had written. I 
20 had written it down multiple times after I started 
21 getting paranoid, I didn't do it at all. 
Q Okay. 22 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any other 
24 questions. Anybody have questions?

1 question is in regards to at the car when you saw 
2 Michael Brown jerk away. 
3 A Yes. 
4 You describe it as arm 
5 movement, you did see the arm? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Do you know if that was 
8 reaction to the gunshot you heard, he was reacting 
9 to a gunshot? 
10 
11 
12 
A 
A 
It may have been. 
The timing wise was right? 
Yes, it was almost simultaneous. 
13 Do you know if it was the 
14 right arm or left arm that you saw pull away? 
15 A Urn, I think, I want to say left arm 
16 because in the front how the police car was shaped, 
17 that picture is gone. How it was slanted, kind of 
18 slanted and I'm looking toward the front. I just 
19 see a jerking motion moving backwards, I want to say 
20 left arm. 
21 After he jerked back, did 
22 he go forward again and reengage, or was this out of 
23 your view? 
24 A I didn't see anything after that. It was 
25 a very quick glimpse.

1 Do you know how long after 
2 that he tried to run or did you see him actually 
3 pull away and run? 
4 A Urn, after I saw the little jerking motion 
5 is when I was reaching for my purse. 
6 Thank you. 
7 A You're welcome. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else? 
9 After 
10 Michael Brown fell, you did continue to observe the 
11 scene, correct, you saw them put up the yellow tape 
12 and all of that? 
13 A Yes, sir. 
14 Did you see anything that 
15 would indicate that anybody moved or interfered with 
16 anything within that taped off area? 
17 A No, no, they wouldn't let anybody near it. 
18 There were already two officers right there and 
19 another one putting up tape. They were securing and 
20 putting the cones down. 
21 if I 
22 can, I'm just referencing back to the testimony or 
23 statement you gave to , Detective 
24 the day when you are sitting in the police 
25 vehicle, do you remember that?

1 A Yeah, yeah, the car, yeah. 
2 I'm referencing page ten 
3 of that transcript. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Did I leave that with you 
5 up there? 
6 A No, you didn't. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: You know what, mine has 
8 markings on it, if you don't mind markings.

A 
Thank you. Is this everything? 
MS. ALIZADEH: You said page ten? 
Yeah, page 10. 
Okay. 
: Go down, I guess fifth 
14 paragraph, I guess. Where it says, I'll just read 
15 what it says here. It says, you're responding to 
16 Detective You said, yes, she said they shot 
17 through the window and, urn, the other guy was 
18 unarmed because he put his hands up so to be 
19 compliant, so this is okay. 
20 So I saw the officer running and by the 
21 time I got to the next window, I saw him get down 
22 like, arms up and then get shot afterwards. 
23 When you say here I got to the next 
24 window, I saw him get down. Okay. Who get down, 
25 who is it that you're referring to, do you recall?

1 A I'm sorry, you said who I was referring 
2 to? 
3 Yeah, uh-huh. 
4 A This sounds odd jumping up, I'm trying to 
5 think about what I was talking about. 
6 Okay. 
7 A I don't know, say get down, I might have 
8 said, for instance, when I saw him fall. 
9 
10 A 
Okay. 
That's probably, that's the most likely 
11 cause how this paragraph is jumbled, I'm pretty sure 
12 I was talking about when I saw him fall when his 
13 arms are like that. (indicating) 
14 So you are referencing 
15 Michael Brown; is that correct? 
16 
17 
18

A 
A 
I was, yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is there someone else? 
I have one other question. 
Sure.
