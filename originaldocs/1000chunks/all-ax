1 A Big Mike and Darren Wilson, the officer, 
2 they are doing their tug of war. He passed me off 
3 the Cigarillos. Now he's back, at no point in time 
4 did I begin to move away, I stood in the same 
5 position, same spot. I'm still in the driver window 
6 of the officer the whole time they are doing their 
7 tug of war, so I can see both of them. I'm going 
8 back and forth looking at both of their faces. 
9 I'm hearing cuss words from both of 
10 them, but I don't really hear the officer saying, 
11 you know, stop or get down on the ground. 
12 I really like, I'm shocked, the shock 
13 level I'm going through right now is continuously 
14 building. So now it is more and more stuff, I'm 
15 trying to comprehend that it is not, it shouldn't be 
16 happening, that I know shouldn't be happening. They 
17 are pulling back and forth. At this time I heard 
18 the officer says, I'll shoot. This is the first he 
19 says, I'll shoot. 
20 At that time I was looking at Big 
21 Mike when he said I'll shoot. In my mind taser, I 
22 see people get tased before and it looks like it 
23 hurts a lot. 
24 Q Let me stop you a minute. So the first 
25 time the officer says, I'll shoot, Big Mike's hands

Yeah. 
He's given you the Cigarillos? 
Yes. 
No shots have been fired yet? 
Not at the moment, no. 
Okay. So do you know where his hands are 
8 when the officer is saying, I'll shoot? 
9 A I can still see both Darren Wilson's hand 
10 and Big Mike's hands. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Tell us about it? 
Big Mike's left hand was still on like 
13 right above the side mirror, right up under that, 
14 right up under the side mirror. His other arm now 
15 because of the tug of war pull, the officer's grip 
16 come up, from up on his neck, to the shirt collar, 
17 to the shoulder, to basically he never let go. Now 
18 he has Big Mike. Big Mike's left arm is on the car 
19 pulling away still, and he's trying to pull away 
20 because now he basically just has his arm. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
So the officer has his right arm? 
Yes, with the officer's left arm, he's out 
23 the window grabbing Big Mike's right arm. 
24 Q Okay. So he has Big Mike's right arm, 
25 does he pull it inside the car?

1 A I really, from the time of everything 
2 happening and once he said, I'll shoot, now my focus 
3 has switched and locked on the officer and say what 
4 he is saying he's going to shoot because in my mind 
5 I assume it is a taser. If it was going to be a 
6 taser, no matter who was in the wrong or who was in 
7 the right, if I would have saw that taser, I would 
8 have immediately told my friend Big Mike, look, just 
9 stop, stop moving, stop pulling away, just stop. 
10 But because I saw the gun and the 
11 barrel, I've been shot before. It is the worse pain 
12 I can ever imagine, it does not feel good, because I 
13 saw the barrel, I went into a deeper shock. 
14 Q You didn't think everybody should just 
15 stop when you saw the gun? 
16 A I was praying, I was, I'm in such shock 
17 right now and firm, because when the officer pulled 
18 up and that's why I was trying to make clear people 
19 were, he's a witness, key witness. I was so 
20 victimized that people don't even understand. 
21 There was a witness standing on their 
22 balcony, a witness drive by in her car, me being 
23 right there in the moment, I felt victimized because 
24 I felt so afraid that I couldn't talk. 
25 I couldn't say what was on my mind

1 because I'm so afraid of, I couldn't calm it down. 
2 I don't have the power to calm down the police 
3 officer and obviously Big Mike is bigger than me. 
4 Q Let's just go back. I understand what you 
5 are saying about seeing the shooting like that, but 
6 when Big Mike's right hand or arm is being pulled 
7 into the car, I don't know if you said that or not, 
8 you said that the officer had his right hand with 
9 his, the officer's left hand had Big Mike's right 
10 arm? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Where is it, did you see it or not, where 
13 his right, where Big Mike's right hand was? 
14 A I didn't see Big Mike's right hand because 
15 the officer had it, but it was up, so it may have 
16 been times when the officer could have pulled his 
17 right, because his left hand never removed off the 
18 officer's car. 
19 So there could have been times when 
20 the officer pulled him, but like I said, because of 
21 the position how Big Mike has on the officer, 
22 officer never got out of the car, he is still 
23 sitting down. He has a better way of pulling with 
24 more force, so he is just pulling. I can see more 
25 of the officer's arm out the window than his arm in

1 the window. 
2 Q From your vantage point, you can tell if 
3 Big Mike's hand ever went inside the officer's car? 
4 A No, because at the point, I'm back and 
5 forth, but when, I'll shoot, my eyes locked on the 
6 officer. 
7 Q So where was, where were the hands, I'm 
8 interested in the hands and the arms? 
9 A At that point when the officer said I'll 
10 shoot, now is like Big Mike, this hand is not on the 
11 car any more. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
That's the left hand? 
The left arm is not on the car any more, 
14 the officer still has the right arm, but he's not 
15 inside the car. And when I look up and see the 
16 officer, the officer has his gun pointed, his left 
17 arm grabbed, he has his gun pointed aimed at Big 
18 Mike. 
19 In my mind it was probably aimed at 
20 both of us, but I assumed he wasn't directly just 
21 trying to go for Big Mike. He had his gun pointed 
22 towards us. I'm still standing in the doorway and 
23 at the time he said I'll shoot. He was going to say 
24 it again, I'll shoot and almost, he didn't get to 
25 finish his sentence, the gun went off.

1 Q At the time that the gun went off, where 
2 were the hands of Big Mike? 
3 A The left arm was down at his side. He was 
4 standing straight up, I was standing right on the 
5 side of him. The right arm was still up in the air 
6 while the officer, but still pulling, but it is not 
7 like he got any, pulling off the car, he is still 
8 pulling the officer. 
9 At this time, like I said, I see more 
10 of the officer's arm outside the car than Big Mike's 
11 arm inside the car, so he has a better position to 
12 pull away from, the officer was sitting down. 
13 Q Just so I understand with the officer's 
14 left hand, he's pulling Big Mike's right arm into 
15 the car and Mike's pulling away and the officer has 
16 his gun in his right hand?

1 shoot, do you know if the gun was inside the car or 
2 outside the car. 
3 A The gun definitely was inside the car when 
4 he fired the shot. How me and Big Mike was 
5 standing, we were standing straight up, so we 
6 definitely was outside the vehicle. The bullet came 
7 outside the car and struck him. He was never inside 
8 the car and got struck, he was outside the car when 
9 the first shot went off. The officer was inside the 
10 car, so the gun was inside the car, but when he shot 
11 the gun, bullet traveled outside his car and struck 
12 Big Mike in the chest, or I seen blood coming from.

15 A It struck him, I definitely know that it 
16 hit him, I saw the blood with the first shot.

19 this is very important, this jury is trying to get 
20 this thing figured out.

22 did not see Big Mike's hands inside the officer's

1 where the officer had a good pull and his arm would 
2 get in there, but majority of the time the officer 
3 really didn't have that much power because of the 
4 position that they both had. I'm not saying that he 
5 was stronger than the officer, but because the 
6 officer was sitting down in his car and Big Mike was 
7 standing up and he had better, more strength in 
8 pulling from the officer. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Right, can you go ahead? 
I never saw at no point in time Big Mike's

12 the gun was already out drawn. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
How about touching the officer? 
Now, touching the officer, now touching 
15 the officer, maybe, because they're pulling each 
16 other, but as far as striking the officer, or 
17 physically striking the officer, no, I didn't see. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
You didn't see him with a fist?

1 A Like I said, I was standing so close and 
2 directly in the doorway with him the whole time 
3 pulling away, he never swung his left arm at all or 
4 never put the left arm inside the window, anything 
5 like that. And because the officer had his right

7 the officer because the officer has his right arm.

MS. WHIRLEY: Go ahead, questions? 
In 
13 here, what we heard earlier, you said that you could 
14 tell, you couldn't really see him, the officer, you 
15 said you couldn't tell what color hair he had, you 
16 couldn't see what kind of build he was, but because 
17 of his arm, you could tell that he was a certain, 
18 you could assume that he was a certain build. If 
19 you couldn't see the officer inside the car, is it 
20 possible that you couldn't have seen Big Mike's arm 
21 go into the car as well. 
22 A I was going to say on that, the way they 
23 ask that question, they was basically asking for a 
24 description on the officer. And I told them that

3 the specific details on the officer so much as 
4 making sure that I'm not in the line of fire.

4 You're not going to have that much 
5 ease with just, hey, get over here in this window. 
6 No, he's big, he's standing up, and the officer's 
7 gun is on his right side, I believe, because that's 
8 where he draw from with his right arm. In order for 
9 Big Mike to have touched the gun, it is almost like 
10 his whole top half of his body had to be inside the 
11 vehicle, and that never happened. 
12 His arm, yes, but like I said, the 
13 officer had it. It wasn't like his arm was in the

20 like it wasn't needed.

Q Hit Big Mike and then what?

3 A When the first shot went off, we were so 
4 close and ringing, I've been shot before so 
5 instantly everything, emotions that I had, like I've 
6 been shot three or four years ago, so everything is 
7 still fresh. With guns, I really dislike them loud 
8 bangs. 
9 At the time and seeing the fire come 
10 out of the gun and shot go off, when I see Big Mike, 
11 I see the blood come down his, where the officer had 
12 his right side. I'm on his right side, I see the 
13 blood come down. 
14 I never looked at myself because I 
15 was so afraid I was like, oh, I saw him. My eyes 
16 got big, he didn't say anything after that. He kind 
17 of looked at my face and saw my eyes and at that 
18 time, that was when the officer let go and we were 
19 both able to run. That's when I turn and run. He

Which way did you run on the map? 
After the first shot took off, we both ran

Okay. 
Now, I was so in shock and so in fear, at

1 that time now I'm just, I'm really afraid, I'm 
2 really afraid. I don't know if the officer's coming 
3 towards Big Mike or just towards both of us. Right 
4 now I'm just so afraid that the time I get past the 
5 first vehicle, I was in front of Big Mike when we 
6 was walking. When I took off running, I was still 
7 in front of him. 
8 When I got to the first vehicle, 
9 which was like a Sunfire or gray Sunfire, so very 
10 small vehicle. The officer was not yet out of his 
11 car, he was still in his car because I was able to 
12 run to the car and like stand, not squatting real 
13 low, but I was standing behind the car, the Sunfire, 
14 but I know he was able to still see the back of my 
15 neck and hair and all of those things. 
16 When Big Mike ran past me, he saw me, 
17 he looked directly at me he said, keep running, Bro. 
18 And at that time is when I kind of hear the door 
19 opening, I figure the officer is getting out of his 
20 car now, but before then, like I said, the officer 
21 was still in his car, I was able to run, squat 
22 behind the first car. 
23 Big Mike ran, he was right behind me. 
24 He looked directly in my eyes and said, keep 
25 running, Bro. That's when I knew that I was still

1 in plain sight. Now, the tension of me, I'm so 
2 afraid that I can't move any more, so I'm just 
3 standing there behind the first car now. 
4 There is people in this car. Now 
5 there is people coming outside the house because 
6 they heard the first shot, there is not that many 
7 people. As Big Mike run past me and sees me, he 
8 keeps going. He makes it past the second car, once 
9 he gets to the second car, I can feel, I'm not 
10 looking around me because I'm so scared. I'm just 
11 standing there and I can feel someone approaching, 
12 so I kind of give a glance over to my right and it 
13 is the officer now, he's walking, he's walking, but 
14 he is kind of fast walking. He's not running or 
15 anything like that, but he has his weapon drawn. 
Q Just like you are doing now? 16 
17 A Yes, in this manner, his weapon is drawn 
18 and he's walking in at fast manner. He's not saying 
19 anything, he's not saying freeze, he's not saying 
20 anything at this time while still just 
concentrating, he is walking. 21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
As I see him, I'm in plain sight, 
Mike was able to see me. He ran past me, keep 
running. I'm so scared, I cannot move my feet. 
And I watch the officer walk past,

1 never even looked at me. He just kept walking past 
2 and I'm watching him and I'm in awe. I'm like okay, 
3 is he looking for us or is he going after him, but 
4 everything is in my head is just racing real fast 
5 because of the gunshot and I'm hyperventilating, my 
6 heart is pounding. 
7 After he walked past me, I kind of 
8 stand up more. I'm trying to ask the people in the 
9 first car, could I please just let me in the 
10 vehicle, I stay in the same complex. You can just 
11 drop me off. They said no, and they pulled off on 
12 the sidewalk. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
Where did they pull to? 
The first car? They didn't drive through 
15 the driveway, they pulled on the sidewalk to drive 
16 past the police officer. Once they pulled off, I 
17 was even more visible now. I'm standing straight, 
18 the officer's back is towards me, Big Mike's back is 
19 towards me and the officer because he is running 
20 away. 
21 I'm watching the officer, he's 
22 walking and Big Mike gets past the third car, the 
23 final car before the second shot was fired. It was 
24 the second shot fired, pow, the officer shot. I 
25 don't know if it hit, I wasn't that close to see

1 that it struck Big Mike, but the manner that he 
2 jerked and just stopped in his track, I sense that 
3 he was hit again. 
4 The first time I definitely knew, I 
5 definitely saw him get shot the first time, he had 
6 been struck one time already. 
7 The second time he shot, I didn't 
8 know if it hit him or not, but he kind of jerked and 
9 that's when he stopped running. He just kind of 
10 stopped and turned around at the officer. And now 
11 he's face-to-face with the officer, but not so 
12 close. 
13 Now, Big Mike is probably, he's not 
14 fully at the driveway, but he gets probably to the 
15 curb of the driveway when the second shot, and now 
16 at the second shot, the officer, I'll just put DW, 
17 he's passing the third vehicle.

Where are you?

You are at the second vehicle? 
Yes, but I'm more over to the side now 
22 because like I said, I was trying to talk to the 
23 people in the front car. I was on the side of their 
24 car when I was trying to talk to them. 
25 After they pulled off, I had to stand

1 up and I was still in shock and now I'm just 
2 watching the officer, you know, pace towards Big 
3 Mike. I see him fire the second shot, I see Big 
4 Mike turn around and face the officer. And now the 
5 officer is past the last car and Big Mike is off the 
6 sidewalk now more in the street. 
7 Q What is Big Mike doing? 
8 A At that time Big Mike's hands was up, but 
9 not so much up in the air because he had been struck 
10 already in this region somewhere on this. It was 
11 like this hands is up and this hand is kind of like 
12 down sort of. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
His hands were nowhere near his waist? 
No, his hands never went down towards his 
15 waistline or anything, like he didn't have a belt on 
16 or anything. 
17 Q Was he sagging, was his pants sagging or 
18 you say he wasn't wearing a belt? 
19 A Yeah, at that time he didn't look like he 
20 was sagging. 
21 Q That's okay if he was, I'm trying to get 
22 the picture. 
23 A At that time I wasn't looking for, I was 
24 looking more at him and the officer because how he 
25 stopped, I felt like he was shot again, so now I'm

1 really fearing like, wow, he's been shot twice. Not 
2 knowing for sure he has been shot twice, definitely 
3 know he has been shot one. 
4 Q Okay. The reason why I am asking you 
5 about the sagging, we probably all know the kind of, 
6 you know, how young folks do it. 
7 A Yeah. 
8 Q A lot of times when they are sagging, 
9 their pants are down so low that you can actually 
10 see the waist area.

1 definitely struck with the first shot. So I could 
2 tell he was injured because this hand was a little 
3 lower than this hand. As I'm looking at him, he 
4 said I'm, he didn't say I'm unarmed per se, he said 
5 I don't have a gun, but he's still mad, he still has 
6 his angry face. I don't have a gun. 
7 And he goes, he never started running 
8 because, you know, he's hit, but sort of, I don't 
9 have a gun. And before he can say the second 
10 sentence or before he can even get it out, that's 
11 when the several more shots came. 
12 Q How close would you say the officer was to 
13 Big Mike when Big Mike is saying to him, I don't 
14 have a gun. Like can you kind of show us?

he's not so close to the third car, but he's like, 
he's not on the sidewalk on the other side, he's 
closer to the other side of the street, the opposite 
side of Big Mike.

20 out before the rest of the shots hit his body. And 
21 I stood and watched face-to-face as every shot was 
22 fired and as his body went down and his body never. 
23 His body kind of just went down and fell, you know, 
24 like a step, you know what I'm saying? Like a step, 
25 his body just kind of collapsed down and he just
