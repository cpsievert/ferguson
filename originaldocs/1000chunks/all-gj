15 his car, and his left side would be toward you then,

1 Q And so at some point is Mike Brown running 
2 east on Canfield, you lose sight of him and then you 
3 don't actually see the shooting? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q Now, and again, on the show which was a 
6 couple of days after this you said that you saw him

Right, I assumed that he did. 
So when you said that on the show, that 
14 was just your assumption? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Why did you assume that, do you still 
17 assume that today? 
18 A Because when Mike Brown is running he's 
19 running down the street and when I seen the body out 
20 there, he was turned the other direction towards the 
21 cop, towards the officer. So I assume that he was 
22 probably running towards him.

1 Q So you are basing that assumption just on 
2 the way the body was positioned in the street? 
3 A Yes, when he was laying down. 
4 Q And is he on his stomach or on his back or 
5 side? 
6 A He was on his stomach, I believe. 
7 Q So could you see how he was laying in the 
8 street from where you were, did you have to come up 
9 and go out onto the street? 
10 A I came up and came out to the sidewalk and 
11 saw the body out there.

13 witnessed, did you witness it from inside your 
14 apartment? 
15 
16

Yes, the incident, yes, I did. 
And do you recall telling on the
