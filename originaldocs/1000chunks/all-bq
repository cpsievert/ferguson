7 Okay. 
8 MS. So what is saying, we 
9 really aren't going to go and tell anybody that you 
10 gave us this information or that we spoke to you 
11 because when we do our investigations, we want to 
12 find out what happened. And the only way to find 
13 out what happened is if people feel that they can 
14 truly just kind of open up and let it out. 
15 Right. 
16 MS. If we end up saying oh, so and 
17 so said this, what do you think about that? 
18 Right. 
19 MS. It kind of doesn't, it, it 
20 doesn't, it muddies the water a little bit.

Yeah, yeah.

4 Okay.

6 kind of lay it out. I know that you are concerned 
7 about, I think you said you saw some websites about 
8 snitches and so forth. 
9 Yeah. 
10 MS. And so is that from concern 
11 from in the community? 
12 Uh, yeah, it could be 
13 anywhere, you know, it could be anywhere. It could 
14 just be anywhere, so I'm not even sure, you know. 
15 MS. We get it. This has caused a

2 when the cameras are rolling and then talking to us. 
3 Because you understand that there's the lives are

2 MS. That Michael Brown went up to

4 Yeah, yeah, cause, like I say, 
5 I look at cops all the time, you know, and I see 
6 other stuff that, you know, it is a lot of people 
7 out there that does stupid stuff to make an officer, 
8 you know, to get down on them or whatever. But that 
9 definitely what I assume. 
10 MS. And -- what you saw, though, 
11 right, you are watching this go on, right? 
12 Yeah. 
13 MS. So what you saw, correct me if 
14 I'm wrong, this kid is doing something really 
15 stupid. 
16 Yeah, I mean, yeah, because 
17 like I said, when I see somebody hit a police 
18 officer, here I'm hearing a tussle like that, it 
19 doesn't look right. So I assume that, you know, 
20 some guy just run up to the car and started punching 
21 on him and the officer gets out of the car and 
22 shoots him dead. 
23 MS. Right, and your immediate

10 this guy in the red car started like saying oh, no, 
11 he started talking about running over and all of 
12 that. 
13 Yeah, but still at the same 
14 time, I only see the moment when he was already at 
15 the vehicle, so I didn't see him run up or anything 
16 like that.

18 ask you some more about that that guy in the car. 
19 Uh-huh.

21 know that could steer us in the direction of finding 
22 him, we would never say told us who

No, that's the only thing.

16 started talking to everybody.

22 Uh, even though I saw him 
23 already at the window, but I just put it to the

3 exactly I saw. He ran up all up in his shit, 
4 whatever, so. 
5 MS. Is that what you saw, that is 
6 what you saw. 
7 Yeah, but still, I mean, when 
8 I saw this kid be different like, as far as like he 
9 could be grabbed to the car. 
10 MS. Did you see him get grabbed? 
11 No, I didn't see him get 
12 grabbed, but if --
13 Have you ever, I'm going to 
14 take his off, have you ever been in a physical fight 
15 before? 
16 Yes. 
17 Fight with somebody. Now 
18 imagine, did you feel like you were at an advantage 
19 or disadvantage? 
20 I mean, you know, I feel if 
21 you are in a fight sometimes, you know, this guy's 
22 getting an advantage. 
23 Let me ask you, if you are 
24 sitting down and someone was standing, who would you 
25 say had the advantage there?

1 Of course, I believe that's a 
2 truck that, of course, anybody standing out of the 
3 vehicle would have an advantage. 
4 Okay. 
5 Because I've seen it before 
6 with my own eyes, that if a guy gets out of the car, 
7 they get to punching on somebody that's in the car, 
8 you know, because they almost can't do nothing with 
9 two hands, you know. 
10 Okay. 
11 Maybe with one, grab one hand 
12 or whatever, but you know, so that there is anybody 
13 outside the car would have the upper hand, you know, 
14 so I do see that. 
15 And did you see that? 
16 Yeah, I mean, I look at it 
17 like I said, anybody outside the vehicle has the 
18 upper hand. 
19 Right. 
20 I assume, you know, he ran up 
21 to the car and punched him up in his face or 
22 whatever, then they takes off running. 
23 So based on what you saw, did 
24 you see, did you feel that Michael Brown had an 
25 advantage or did you think it was the other way

1 around? 
2 A Uh, I mean, the advantage, he definitely 
3 has an upper advantage if he's throwing punches, if 
4 he's throwing punches from outside the vehicle. So, 
5 but like I said, it could be different reasons why, 
6 you know, he was on the side and then pulling, 
7 trying to be pulled in or something like that, but. 
8 We're not asking you to 
9 figure that out either, so don't feel like you have 
10 to. 
11 Okay. 
12 We're just trying to find 
13 different ways to kind of jog your memory. 
14 Yeah, but anybody standing 
15 outside the vehicle they would have the upper 
16 advantage on throwing punches. 
17 MS. Could I ask you some more about 
18 that guy in the burgundy car? 
19 Yes. 
20 
21

10 the, I saw the autopsy. And I remember telling the

12 Mike Brown was hit six times, you know. 
13 I was saying like, he only shot six times 
14 through that whole time? So, you know, I was 
15 breaking that down so, but if I even said that to 
16 him, it is probably, you know, because I already 
17 heard somebody said that's the reason why they ran

Okay. So you brought up 
is reading what I refer to the 
is reading a transcript of it. The 
4 reason we were asking about it is it was clearly 
5 something different that you said from what you're 
6 saying today. It doesn't mean you are getting in 
7 trouble for that, we are just trying to figure out 
8 why you said one thing on one day and why you are 
9 saying a different thing today, and that is why we 
10 brought it up. 
11 
12 little part.

MS. 
MR. 
Okay. That is just that 
Right. 
And you said other things 
15 before, you mentioned different 
16 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was 
17 adding--
18 MR. You have talked about, yeah, 
19 right, I'm just talking about, you know, when you go 
20 back through those statements, there is that one 
21 instance we talked about, you know, where you talk 
22 about the police officer being in the car when you 
23 heard the first shots fired. 
24 Other times you talked about that he was 
25 out of the car when the first shots were fired.

1 What we are trying to figure out is just 
2 how you best recall it or whether or not you are 
3 sure about whether he was or, you know, at the time 
4 that the shots occurred, that's all we are trying to 
5 do. 
6 Okay, not a problem. 
7 MR. Well, I mean, let me just 
8 touch on that one more time. Can you tell us what 
9 you recall about at that point as you are looking at 
10 the window? 
11 As I'm looking out the window, 
12 I see Mike Brown at the driver's side window of the 
13 police vehicle. I see a tussle, I see his arms 
14 moving, I see the officers arms moving, so I heard a 
15 hard tussling. 
16 Then all of the sudden they just takes 
17 off, they just takes off running. I see his friend, 
18 like I said, he runs to the first car that he sees, 
19 runs behind the trunk of the car because the officer 
20 immediately gets out of his vehicle and started 
21 shooting. So I see him looking at the officers as 
22 he was taking large steps going for Mike Brown. 
23 About the time that I notice that the 
24 officer went past his friend, that's when I came 
25 outside. By the time I gets outside, I see Mike

1 Brown now facing the officer. He's bent down, got 
2 his arm under his stomach and, urn, like he was going 
3 down, not even to surrender, to say give up, just 
4 going down to bleed a little, but the officer just 
5 lets out four or five more shots at him and then he 
6 hits the ground.

MR. 
MR. 
All right. 
Just like (inaudible) 
You said several times too 
10 that those first shots that officer fired, closer to 
11 the car, that you heard those. Are you sure that 
12 you actually saw him fire those shots or did you 
13 hear those shots, or because you said several times, 
14 I notice in your prior statements that you refer to 
15 hearing them. 
16 Yeah, I saw him. I saw him 
17 shooting at Mike Brown the moment he gets out of the 
18 vehicle. 
19 MR. Okay. The moment he's 
20 getting out of the vehicle? 
21 Yeah, the moment --
22 MR. Is he fully out of the car? 
23 Yeah, he is fully out of his 
24 car standing with his gun out, starts shooting, but 
25 he is still in his vehicle range and his cruiser

24 to talk anyone, you can do that too, but I do think

6 seem hesitant, that's why I keep asking you.

9 know, come down to the FBI or whatever, I've been, 
10 you know, I can't wait to get down there, you know, 
11 I need to tell you how I feel. You know, what's

1 Okay. 
2 I've been eating like 
3 horrible, like once a day, like mostly like at 
4 nighttime. You know, so the whole day I eat little 
5 snacks, I'm not getting full like, you know, 
6 everybody supposed to eat good full like two or 
7 three times a day at least, but I'm not eating much, 
8 not getting as good of sleep. 
9 What's on your mind? 
10 I mean, I don't know just, urn, 
11 maybe just what if what I already did with the 
12 reporters and, you know, I be thinking like somebody 
13 is looking for me, maybe. You know, I just have 
14 weird feelings. 
15 What type of person, what do 
16 you think that you did wrong? 
17 I mean, just the point, urn, I 
18 did quite a few interviews and I don't think, I only 
19 know there's a few witnesses. I think I just 
20 notice --
21 There is only a few witnesses 
22 that went to the media, there is a big difference 
23 between only a few witnesses. 
24 Okay. I don't think they 
25 didn't do as many as I did.

2 But like I said, I don't know 
3 if I'm just worried, by me doing that I just 
4 immediately felt so worried since then and not 
5 having a lawyer and seeing that on the internet. 
6 MS. Are you worried about being 
7 called a snitch? 
8 No, I'm not worried about 
9 that. I'm hoping, I don't want nothing happening to 
10 me, you know. Maybe if my information is really 
11 good enough or whatever, and you know, I don't want 
12 nobody coming looking for me because I have good 
13 information, whatever the case.

I have a weird feeling.

5 and this is what I saw, you know.

Yeah. 8
