5 on the gun when you examine the gun, correct? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And when you fire that weapon, does the 
8 hammer come back and go forward striking the firing 
9 pin? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
So if there would be something that would 
12 prevent that hammer from moving backwards and 
13 forward, would that cause the gun to not fire even 
14 though you pulled the trigger, it could? 
15 A Absolutely it could. And that, in fact, 
16 would be a scenario where the action of the firearm 
17 is impeded. Yes, interference with that hammer and 
18 motion of that hammer would prevent the firing pin 
19 being struck and firing that cartridge. 
20 Q And then what about, you know, you've 
21 described, or I did and you also explain to where 
22 the hammer strikes the firing pin, which is 
23 basically on the bottom of the bullet, correct? 
24 A It's inline with the primer of the loaded 
25 live cartridge, yes.

1 Q If there is something that is in between 
2 the hammer and that firing pin, whether it be, you 
3 know, but something that would be between that 
4 action, could that possibly explain why you pulled 
5 the trigger and nothing happened? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q In other words, if a part of your hand 
8 would be in between that firing pin and the hammer, 
9 that could prevent the weapon from firing? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, absolutely. 
And if that were to have happened, again, 
12 pure speculation, but if that were to have happened, 
13 and the weapon would not fire, if that obstruction 
14 was removed between the hammer and the firing pin, 
15 would the weapon then be able to cycle normally 
16 after that? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Misfire. 
Or would you have to then go ahead and 
19 eject that round? 
20 A This firearm you could pull the trigger a 
21 second time. If the action is not impeded, it would 
22 be expected to fire then. It is not true of all 
23 firearms, but this firearm yes. 
24 Q Okay. And if that were to have happened 
25 with this firearm, would there be anyway to tell

1 that simply from your examination of the weapon? 
2 A In the scenario you've described, no. 
3 Because there are no marks on that live cartridge 
4 for me to observe. In other words, a different 
5 scenario, for example, I gave a bad ammunition was 
6 my first example. If you tried to fire it once and 
7 pulled the trigger again and that firing pin struck 
8 that primer a second time and then fired, I would 
9 note two firing pin impressions and know that there 
10 was more than one attempt to fire it. 
11 But in your scenario, no. There 
12 would be no marks made, I would have no indications 
13 on what evidence was submitted to me? 
14 Q Now, in this case, let me ask you, you 
15 described how the gun was fired from the weapon and 
16 you mention that there are marks left on the empty 
17 cartridge that is ejected from the ejection port, 
18 correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And there is also markings that are made 
21 on the bullet itself as it is forced through the 
22 barrel of the gun, correct? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And can you see those markings using a 
25 microscope?

A Yes. 1 
2 Q Are those markings made by the individual 
3 weapon that fires that cartridge? 
4 A The answer is yes and no. And if you'll 
5 allow me, let me explain. 
6 Q Okay, go ahead. 
7 A There are what's called class 
8 characteristics. The number of the lands and groves 
9 and the direction of their twist inside the barrel, 
10 as well as the dimension of those lands and groves, 
11 that is determined by the manufacturing. They make 
12 many, many firearms with those specifications. 
13 So you might have one right after 
14 another coming off an assembly line that putting six 
15 left .40 caliber barrels out to be put into these 
16 pistols. And they're going to have those same class 
17 characteristics, they are intended by the 
18 manufacturer. 
19 However, as the tool wears during the 
20 making of that part, and as the gun is used after it 
21 is manufactured and sold, by firing, cleaning, 
22 abusing, misuse, etc., there are microscopic 
23 qualities in that are called individual 
24 characteristics. They're specific. Every one of 
25 us, if we were all given the same firearm in this

1 room would treat it the same way and have exactly 
2 the same microscopic qualities or individual 
3 characteristics in our barrels after a hundred or a 
4 thousand rounds as an example. 
5 Are they unique to the weapon? Yes. 
6 There are some characteristics that I look for under 
7 the microscope to be able to tell one bullet from 
8 another, from the source of another or to determine 
9 whether or not they came from the same source fire. 
10 Q So in this case, were you able to examine 
11 the shell casings that you had been submitted and 
12 you had a total of 12; is that correct? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes, that's correct. 
Were those shell casings the same make and 
15 manufacture as the live round that was submitted to 
16 you? 
17 A Yes, they're Federal and .40 S & W 
18 caliber. 
19 Q Were you able to compare the bullets which 
20 are submitted to you, which are five in number,

On the 11th I had five submitted to me. 
2 And they indeed were observed to be jacketed hollow 
3 point design bullet and .40 caliber, and it had six 
4 land and grove impressions with a left twist. 
5 Q And when we're talking about the five 
6 bullets, these are spent bullets, correct? 
7 A Right. These are fired. They would not 
8 have the lands and groves of the barrel incrust upon 
9 them until they're fired through the barrel, yes. 
10 Q Were you able to determine whether or not 
11 the five bullets that were submitted to you and the 
12 12 casings that were submitted to you, were you able 
13 to draw any conclusions after comparing those items 
14 with the firearm that had been submitted to you? 
15 A I was. In test firing the submitted 
16 firearm, I retained fired cartridge cases and fired 
17 bullets. That's what I microscopically compared to 
18 submitted evidence. I was able to determine that 
19 all 12 of the submitted fired cartridge cases have a 
20 sufficient quantity and quality of those matching 
21 individual characteristics for me to conclude that 
22 they were fired in this firearm. 
23 Q So just so we're clear, the 12 cartridge 
24 cases, they're like we call casings, or what I call 
25 casings?

Yes. 
The hollow kind of left over that gets 
3 thrown out of the ejection port, correct? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And then were you able to, I see here on 
6 page two of your report, you number the bullets as 
7 QB 1 through 5, and then you also reference where, 
8 where they were discovered. Is this information 
9 that you received on the evidence packaging that 
10 each bullet was packaged in? 
11 A It may or may not be on the package 
12 itself, but I get that directly from the evidence 
13 receipt that accompanies that evidence and 
14 packaging, yes. 
15 Q So for QB 1, which is a copper jacketed 
16 hollow point bullet, .40 caliber, you have here from 
17 FPDVEH.108. What does that mean? 
18 A Uh, that is in quotations, because I took 
19 it directly from the evidence receipt. And my 
20 understanding is that stands for Ferguson Police 
21 Department Vehicle Number 108. 
22 Q Okay. And you have here a measure of 158 
23 grams and CSU Number 7. What does that mean? 
24 A The 158 is in grains, we measure in 
25 grains. And the CSU stands for Crime Scene Unit and

1 that Number 7 next to that is their item number. So 
2 seizing detectives item number was given my 
3 laboratory specimen number QB 1. It stands for 
4 questionable, by the way. QB stands for 
5 questionable cartridge case. 
6 Q And so the QB 2, 3 and 4, you indicate 
7 have been from the evidence receipt. It says from 
8 Brown's right side of back, right side of chest and 
9 right side of head. Those are all spent bullets 
10 that were seized by someone else and packaged and 
11 according to evidence receipt, were recovered from 
12 the body of Michael Brown, would that be what you're 
13 indicating? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
It is. 
And then regarding QB 5, it says from 
16 roadway and your information was then that this 
17 bullet was received from a roadway or on the street? 
18 A Yes, I had no further description of a 
19 specific location. Just what I noted there in the 
20 roadway. 
21 Q And so after examining QB 1 through 5, 
22 were you able to make any, draw any conclusion about 
23 whether those bullets were fired from the weapon 
24 that had been submitted to you, the Sig Sauer? 
25 A Yes, I was.

2 
Q 
A 
And what were your conclusions? 
The first one listed specimen QB 1, 
3 apparently from Ferguson police vehicle was 
Page 102 
4 inconclusive. It had enough damage to its surfaces 
5 that I did not have enough of those microscopic 
6 characteristics to match to my test shots to 
7 determine that it came from the same source. 
8 I did not have enough differences 
9 either to think or believe that it came from a 
10 different source firearm. So it is inconclusive for 
11 number one. However QB 2, 3, 4 and 5 had a 
12 sufficient quantity and quality of those matching 
13 individual characteristics in the rifling striations 
14 that we've talked about for me to conclude that they 
15 were indeed fired from this firearm. 
16 Q Now, at a later date you were submitted 
17 another evidence item and asked to compare it to 
18 your QB, what's the gun called? 
19 A QF 1 or the test shots are TB 1A and B, TC 
20 1A and B, compared with my test shots. 
21 Q Okay. Did you make a report after you 
22 examined this additional evidence item?

3 Q 
Page 103 
(Grand Jury Exhibit Number 34 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And Grand Jury Exhibit 
4 Number 34, I made copies of this report for the 
5 grand jurors. 
6 So what was the additional item that 
7 was submitted to you? 
8 A It was a copper jacketed hollow point 
9 bullet fragment. In other words, it was not the 
10 complete whole bullet, it was only part of that 
11 bullet. I note that it was one side of a bullet, 
12 all the way from base to nose. It was part, once 
13 part of a .40 caliber bullet. It had six lands and 
14 groves with a left twist represented and it was from 
15 2909 Canfield, seized on September 3rd of this year. 
16 Q All right. And you examined this QB 6, 
17 your QB 6 and were you able to compare it to the 
18 test shots that you fired from the Sig Sauer weapon 
19 that was submitted to you back on the 11th of 
20 August?

1 conclude that this bullet was also fired from this 
2 firearm. 
3 Q And the items that you tested and examined 
4 in this case, did you repackage them and were those 
5 submitted to property control for safekeeping and 
6 storage? 
7 A That is the intended destination and, yes, 
8 I finished my examination, resealed the packages and 
9 put them in our vault on a shelf that is intended 
10 for the evidence to be forwarded to property 
11 control. 
12 Q And just one more thing because I haven't 
13 seen the firearm that we're talking about in this 
14 case, but I recall from other cases I've had that 
15 sometimes the firearm has orange tape on the end of 
16 the barrel, is that still done when you are finished 
17 examining a weapon? 
18 A It is. It's an extra measure. We talked 
19 about the zip tie earlier, I provide the officers, 
20 my department with bright orange zip ties and that 
21 is so it is readily visible to anyone that if the 
22 firearm is handled openly, especially in court at a 
23 later time, that that's highly visible and they know 
24 that it's safe. 
25 I add in my lab when my examination

1 is done, I added, my other examiners we add that 
2 bright orange tape to the barrel as well. It is 
3 nothing more than a visual indicator for you that 
4 what is being handled is safe and can't be fired in 
5 the state it's in.

Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody have any 
MS. WHIRLEY: I have just a couple. You 
13 want to go first? 
14 No. 
15 Q (By Ms. Whirley) That bullet, the copper

19 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: That's the next question. 
I understand it is another apartment in 
20 the area, but where inside that building I don't 
21 have specific knowledge. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) On first page of Exhibit 
23 Number 33, Grand Jury 33, poor condition of residue, 
24 what does that mean? 
25 A When I look in the barrel, I simply note

Page 106 
1 is it clean and free of any debris, is there 
2 residues. I'm not even certain what those residues 
3 might be. Sometimes it is dust from people carrying 
4 it, it gets clothing dust in it, sometimes it is 
5 from firing it. There is residues left behind. 
6 When you fire a cartridge, 100 percent of the gun 
7 powder isn't consumed, there is some partial burned 
8 and some unburn powders, sometimes they're left in 
9 the barrel, sometimes they just fly out of the gun 
10 and left in the nearby area. 
11 Residue is simply that there was some 
12 debris in that barrel, but the barrel itself was not 
13 obstructed. It wasn't heavily fouled with multiple 
14 firings and build up of residues, it was simply a 
15 small amount of residue. 
16 Q Okay. And the grain, like it's 158.0 
17 grain, 177.0 grain, what does that grain mean, what 
18 are we talking about? 
19 A That's a measurement much like grams and 
20 ounces and so forth. 
21 Q Of what, though, what are we measuring? 
22 A That is the weight of the bullet. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So specimen QB 1, I described as a bullet 
25 itself. The full weight of that bullet that was

Page 107 
1 submitted to me was 158 grains. 
2 Q And they're different weights because of 
3 what they went through once they were fired? 
4 A Yes, and they're manufactured in different 
5 weights by manufacturers. Their starting weight 
6 might be, for example, 154 grains, but they might 
7 add weight because they retain wall material if they 
8 were dug out of the wall or something of that 
9 nature. 
10 Or if it is a fragment, you might 
11 only have part of the full weight of the bullet. 
12 Sometimes that weight helps us determine a caliber, 
13 it didn't really come into play in this scenario. 
14 Q The internal safety, what is that on this 
15 weapon, you said it has an internal safety? 
16 A Basically what I mean is the parts in the 
17 firearm are designed so it cannot be fired unless 
18 you pull the trigger. If you drop it, it's not 
19 going to fire. If you hit on the hammer, you know, 
20 with something, it's not going to fire. It's 
21 designed not to go off unless you pull the trigger 
22 of that firearm. 
23 Q So this weapon was fired 12 times; is that 
24 correct, based on your examination? 
25 A For there to be 12 fired cartridge cases

Q 
12 individual times? 
At least, yes. 
Is that the difference between a 
7 semiautomatic and an automatic? 
8 A Yes, an automatic you could hold the 
9 trigger back and it will continue firing until you 
10 release the trigger. So a fully automatic firearm 
11 might fire every cartridge available to it with one 
12 pull of the trigger, but this is not that kind 
13 weapon.

1 mean, this is your report, is that some 
2 determination you made? 
3 A No, actually, that is some of the, as I 
4 mentioned earlier, some of the case information that 
5 is provided to us on the evidence receipt that is 
6 submitted with the evidence. That case information 
7 is entered into our laboratory system, so different 
8 areas of the lab know what evidence they have to 
9 examine and so forth. And it is auto populated into 
10 our reports. 
11 So it was submitted, again, on the 
12 evidence receipts that the offense is an assault on 
13 a law enforcement officer. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. You had nothing to 
15 do with that being determined? 
16 A That's correct. Now, we will often get

18 different offenses listed. We, there's no real 
19 rhyme or reason to figuring out which one is

11 We 
12 heard previously about this stovepiping, and how it 
13 didn't appear that there was any. Would that have 
14 to be taken off, would it have to be repaired for 
15 that gun to fire again if that was there? 
16 A Good question. No, there is no physical 
17 repair needed for that. Basically the fired 
18 cartridge case becomes an obstruction to the action 
19 of that firearm. And a practiced user of that 
20 firearm can clear that because it's not permanently 
21 trapped. It is just kind of pinched in place. So 
22 if you pull the slide back and release that 
23 pressure, it can fall out or be caused to fall out. 
24 And then there is no impairment to the action. So 
25 if you let the slide go, the firearm would then

2 Is that the only type of 
3 reason that that firearm wouldn't go, or whatever, 
4 that you would be able to see? Like you always talk 
5 about if something obstructing like a hand or piece 
6 of whatever, the stovepiping is the only thing that 
7 you would be able to examine, it is not necessary 
8 for you to be able to tell exactly what happened and 
9 say it would be able to be fired, am I explaining 
10 myself correctly? 
11 A I think I understand your question. Is 
12 there any circumstances where a firearm wouldn't 
13 function that I could tell, is that basically what 
14 you're asking? 
15 That's right, that you 
16 couldn't tell, you couldn't say no, that firearm 
17 didn't get stuck. 
18 A No. 
19 There is no possible way 
20 that it would happen that way? 
21 A I could not, you posed a good question. I 
22 can't think of a scenario where I could prove that 
23 something did not happen in the firing of the 
24 firearm.

3 
A Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: If the, in the firing of 
4 the weapon the cartridge has stovepiped and you said 
5 it kind of gets caught in that ejection port and the 
6 ejection port has a door to it, correct? 
7 A There's an opening in the slide called the 
8 ejection port, but not a door per se that closes on 
9 that. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. But the cartridge 
11 gets caught in between something, correct? 
12 A Basically the barrel itself where it's 
13 supposed to feed into, it can get caught against 
14 that and then when the slide closes on that, that 
15 ejection port is what might hold that fired 
16 cartridge case against the barrel to where it is 
17 kind of standing up out of there. 
18 Q If that were to have occurred, could you 
19 look at that cartridge casing and see marks on it 
20 that might indicate that it had been stuck in the 
21 gun that way? 
22 A And that's where I was thinking the answer 
23 might take me, but is it possible? Yes. However, 
24 because those marks are unpredictable, there may be 
25 marks on a cartridge case that I can't determine

1 their origin. 
2 So while it very well may have 
3 happened and there may be marks from being a 
4 stovepipe, it's also quite possible that it is not 
5 something that I could conclusively say were from a 
6 stovepipe simply because ammunition in a pocket with 
7 keys is going to get marked. Ammunition thrown in a 
8 drawer is going to roll around. I mean, they get 
9 marked in so many ways, same as anybody's jewelry or 
10 anything else that we have with a metal surface, it 
11 is going to have scratches and so forth to it. 
12 And it's not in a uniform or

14 not from that type of event.

1 This is kind of a two-part 
2 question. Tell me where on the gun did you see the 
3 blood and you cleaned it off yourself that you've 
4 testified; is that correct? 
5 A Yes. 
6 Could you tell me where 
7 you saw the blood on the gun and also in the area 
8 where the hammer is on the gun? 
9 A Uh-huh. 
10 Was there any blood or 
11 human tissue that you found in that area as well? 
12 A I don't take note of where I see the blood 
13 or any tissue because it will have been in 
14 photographs before it gets to me. It also goes for 
15 other examinations and sampling before it gets to 
16 me. So by the time I'm receiving it, all of that 
17 other testing and documentation has been completed 
18 and I don't have it as a concern in my part of the 
19 laboratory. I hope that you will find that answer 
20 from other witnesses, but I don't have those. 
21 Thank you. 
22 A You're welcome. Yes, sir.

24 back to the stovepiping, I guess.

1 If that was to happen, 
2 would that be, would it come out as a bullet or does 
3 it come out as a spent casing? 
4 A Good question. It could happen both ways. 
5 If the cartridge is fired and extracted out of the 
6 barrel and then it attempts to eject it out of the 
7 firearm, but it gets caught and trapped before it's 
8 able to clear that ejection port, you would have a 
9 fired cartridge case and it looks like a chimney or 
10 a stovepipe if you will, but if for some reason, and 
11 sometimes it is just random and there is no even 
12 reproducing it. 
13 If the action fires that cartridge 
14 and successfully ejects that fired cartridge case, 
15 but it fails to properly feed the live cartridge 
16 from the magazine, in other words, it is designed to 
17 come up out of the magazine, go up the feed ramp and 
18 into the chamber, but if it bounces up off of that, 
19 the action can close and trap a live cartridge there 
20 as well. 
21 Now, in either scenario, if you have 
22 something trapped, as I mentioned with 
23 , working the action is all you need to clear that 
24 and assuming you have more ammunition, feed the next 
25 cartridge and then continue to fire, but what you

1 would have left behind on the ground next to you is 
2 different, you would have either the fired cartridge 
3 case that was cleared or the live cartridge that was 
4 cleared. Does that answer your question? 
5 Could you demonstrate how 
6 you clear a round with that particular firearm? 
7 A Okay. If you grip that firearm, it has a 
8 grip and trigger guard, so if your finger is in that 
9 trigger guard, it is held pretty much like this. 
10 Above that, on the back of the gun is 
11 where the hammer would be, okay, visible, external 
12 hammer, all right. So when you pull the trigger, 
13 there is single action and double action, only a 
14 double action trigger pull, it is a long, heavy 
15 trigger pull that also cocks that hammer and then 
16 releases it to strike the firing pin, okay. 
17 If you fire like that, this pistol is 
18 designed for that slide then to come rearward. As 
19 it's coming rearward, the extractor or the hook 
20 pulling it rearward towards the ejector, which then 
21 hits and ejects it out the open ejection port of the 
22 firearm. Whereas that slide comes back, it is 
23 cocking the hammer as well, okay. Because this has 
24 a single action mode as well. 
25 So that hammer will be locked back

1 when that slide feeds the next cartridge and goes 
2 forward. So now you have a loaded cartridge in the 
3 chamber already cocked so your trigger pull is 
4 designed to be much, much less because you don't 
5 have to pull the full weight of it and cock it, you 
6 are only pulling enough to release. Okay. 
7 To answer your question specifically, 
8 if it were jammed, you would simply maintain your 
9 grip on that firearm, most commonly with your other 
10 hand, but if it is incapacitate there are other 
11 means to do it, but grabbing that slide, taking the 
12 pressure off of that jammed live or spent cartridge 
13 case and getting it out of the gun and then letting 
14 it go, it should feed the next cartridge and being 
15 cocked and ready to fire, okay. 
16 Can you 
17 talk about when a spent cartridge is ejected, what 
18 direction does it eject from the gun up, down, side 
19 ways, forward, back, whatever, and then about how 
20 far do you expect it to travel before it hits the 
21 ground? 
22 
23 
A I'm asked that question, I'm sorry. 
Is it pretty consistent 
24 the cartridges hit about the same area? The first 
25 question was direction after the ejection.

1 A I might actually summarize the answer for 
2 the entire question you've asked, because I'm asked 
3 question a lot. It differs for every firearm, but 
4 since we are talking about a particular make and 
5 model here and a specific firearm, I will tell you 
6 that it's unpredictable even within a single firearm 
7 because you have different elements in play. 
8 For example, if the firearm were even 
9 intended to send them in the exact same direction to 
10 the exact same distance every time, a simple turning 
11 of the firearm at any angle is going to change where 
12 those cartridge cases land and how far they go, but 
13 they're not designed to do that. They're really 
14 only designed to clear that weapon. 
15 So sometimes they'll go good 
16 distances, sometimes they'll go short distances, 
17 like they're just dribbling out of the gun, 
18 sometimes they'll fly over the back of your head, 
19 sometimes they'll go to your right, straight up, 
20 forward, and things of that nature. 
21 It is such an unreliable factor for 
22 determining where someone is positioned, for 
23 example, that we don't give any credence to ejection 
24 patterning, if you will. There is just too many 
25 variables that come into play, especially if you

1 start dealing with a scene that intentionally or 
2 even unintentionally has been tampered with is to 
3 strong of term. It could be kicked, it could be 
4 stepped on, it could be carried by a car tire, it 
5 could bounce off of things and so forth. Final 
6 positioning of cartridge cases is something that we 
7 don't even consider. 
8 Cartridge cases 
9 are very light, obviously, they bounce around. When 
10 they're ejected, they don't just roll, they often 
11 come out spinning, flying all of over the place, 
12 correct? 
13 A Absolutely. 
14 On a weapon like that with 
15 a slide that comes back and what I would say is 
16 pretty aggressive if you've ever seen it, it comes 
17 back pretty quick, pretty hard. 
18 A Oh, yeah. 
19 Do you have any guess at 
20 what kind of pressure you apply to a slide like 
21 that, could you hold a slide like that back if 
22 somebody tried to hold the slide, is that possible, 
23 or would you expect a lot of damage to your hands, 
24 the gun? 
25 A Surprisingly, it doesn't take as much as

1 one would think. And the reason I say that is I'm 
2 not going to put my hand in the way. It comes back 
3 with a good deal of force. In fact, there are 
4 officers, you know, when we're issued these guns and 
5 first training on them that if they hold their thumb 
6 in the wrong place, you are going to hurt yourself. 
7 Now that said, I have spoken to 
8 others who have been brave enough, if that's the 
9 right word, to use their thumb to try and hold that 
10 slide in place and they have been successful in 
11 firing that weapon and preventing it from cycling. 
12 So I don't have any idea, I can't 
13 describe what amount of energies and forces it would 
14 take to do that, but I know that it can be done. 
15 And that's a little 
16 surprise because when you see it, it looks like it 
17 comes back with an enormous amount of force. 
18 A Yeah. In fact, what I can tell you is if 
19 I don't have a good way to describe this, but I'd 
20 rather have my thumb on it and against it and trying 
21 to hold it forward then behind it and away from it 
22 and not expecting it because it is going to hurt a 
23 lot more getting hit like that, than it is going to 
24 take to overcome the pressure that it's creating. 
25 I guess even thinking while I'm

1 speaking, the energy that takes that bullet out of 
2 the gun, is also equal but opposite rearward and 
3 that's the recoil. 
4 So if you think about it, if the gun 
5 were to fire without any support from a human being 
6 at all, they would go an equal distance apart, but 
7 we're overcoming that in holding that gun. 
8 So I'm thinking maybe it wouldn't 
9 take so much to prevent that slide from cycling. 
10 Suffice it to say, I know it's possible, I know it 
11 can be done and there is a wide range of ways to do 
12 that. 
13 Do you have any idea what 
14 the opening, once cycle through one series, the 
15 hammer is now cocked, do you have any idea what the 
16 opening is between the back of that slide and the 
17 start of that hammer, is there enough to get a 
18 finger between, a thumb between there? 
19 A Absolutely, it is a visible amount of 
20 distance. In fact, in the training of officers, 
21 when I first started a number of years ago, my first 
22 duty firearm was a revolver and it had an exposed 
23 hammer as well. And part of the training was if we 
24 were faced with a revolver or we're to lose our own

1 hand into that space so then that gun can't be 
2 fired. 
3 So not only are you grabbing the gun, 
4 but you are preventing it from being fired back at 
5 you. So absolutely is there room to obstruct that
