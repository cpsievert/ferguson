22 So you were there from 
23 February to August, would you say you heard it more

17 picking up shell casings.

8 straight into the living room, then my living room 
9 is pretty spacious and then there's a slight hallway 
10 and then my bedroom goes in, so it was right next to

3 statement is contained on a disc that I have marked 
4 as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 36.

8 seconds in length. I have transcripts that I can 
9 pass. 
10 I want to mention during the break 
11 before we began recording again, the grand jurors 
12 had asked if we could try to get a floor plan of the 
13 apartments, and we'll look into that if that can be 
14 done. Also I intend, I'm going to try to get some 
15 testimony from a witness who, as you heard the last 
16 witness, he said that they were interviewed at their 
17 home by federal agents. So it's possible that I 
18 could get one of them who has been inside the 
19 apartment to maybe describe, if we don't have a 
20 floor plan available. 
21 And then also there was a question 
22 about topography, if there was any maybe 
23 topographical maps available. I don't know the 
24 answer to that, but we can see if we can find some. 
25 I also advised the grand jurors that

1 we have had some additional investigation done where 
2 we had officers go out to the scene as recent as 
3 last week and take photographs with a lens that 
4 would be as close to what the human eye sees as we 
5 can get. 
6 In other words, it is not a zoom lens 
7 or anything like that and taking photographs from 
8 different vantage points because I gathered from 
9 some questions that had been asked previously that 
10 this might be a question that you have about, you 
11 know, can somebody be in a certain place and see 
12 what they are describing that they saw. 
13 So I would probably call 
14 to introduce those photos. And as I mentioned 
15 before, if we may have a gap today with witnesses 
16 who might not appear. And so is 
17 standing by ready as one of my fill-in witnesses. 
18 So that might be something that we can get to this 
19 afternoon. 
20 Also, yesterday, we had 
21 talk about taking photographs of Darren Wilson's
