8 how close, could you see how close in contact they

10 Urn, there was definitely close 
11 enough. Urn, there was definitely close enough so, I 
12 just figured that Mike Brown, he could, I don't 
13 think that he was to like real up on the passenger 
14 door, it was just a little bit of space and I could 
15 just see something going on roughly through the 
16 window.

4 Yeah, urn, the one I have when

7 MS. So in that video, the very 
8 first thing that you say, you are kind of, you 
9 remember you are talking while you are videoing? 
10 Uh-huh. 
11 MS. Okay. So one of the very first 
12 things that you say, that you said that the guy, the 
13 black guy just ran, ran up to the car and was 
14 punching on it. 
15 Yeah. 
16 MS. You said, the dude ran on the 
17 side, urn, you talking about the other one ran to the 
18 Monte Carlo, then he went back to the first guy. 
19 You said, the dude was all up in his car, you said 
20 up in his shit punching on him. 
21 Yeah, that's what I assume 
22 because, urn, younger people like that, I think that, 
23 you know, that don't want to go to jail, you know, 
24 just being young. So, you know, I assume a person 
25 like that will be punching an officer to get away or

8 MS. General nervousness is normal, 
9 especially like in (inaudible) . If there is 
10 anything in particular that makes you nervous at 
11 all, we want to know that. So is there anything in 
12 particular or just a general feeling from Goggling 
13 yourself? 
14 A Urn, that, urn, one moment, urn, at the time 
15 when the audio came out about the shooting, let me 
16 see, like a week and a half earlier before that I 
17 stopped doing interviews, I didn't receive no calls, 
18 I was fine. I could go home and enjoy. 
19 So when that came out, I started 
20 getting calls again, they was at my house while I 
21 was at work trying to come up to my job. 
22 MR. And who were they that you 
23 are referring to? 
24 The reporters, news reporter. 
25 MR. Uh-huh.

1 And urn, let's see, maybe the 
2 same day I knew it was on the tube that when it 
3 aired on the news and stuff like that, it was on a 
4 Tuesday or a Wednesday. I had to go pick up my 
5 fiancee about 9:30 that night to leave out of my 
6 house to go pick her up. I know that day I received 
7 a call from a reporter at six something. And 
8 another call at seven or eight something and then I 
9 got a text like just before 9:00. 
10 I had to put up my little son's car seat 
11 in the car. So I went outside to go and do that and 
12 as soon as, right when I gets to my car, a lady just 
13 runs up, it is dark now. And at this time I notice 
14 there is not a lot people out, I know that for sure, 
15 but she just runs up, just runs up, hey, 
16 can you do another interview, you know, but 
17 she was nice. She just ran up, you know, like it 
18 was, I was already scared at that point. 
19 But I just, I looks at a lot of movies and 
20 stuff and it just gets me thinking like, like if 
21 anybody was trying to at that time, you know, that 
22 was a good opportunity at that time. 
23 
24 
You know, I think of stuff like that. 
MS. Are you worried about your 
25 physical safety, is that what you are trying to say?

9 to you though, we aren't going to talk. We aren't 
10 going to say we spoke with , I'm sorry,

12 actually go to the news. So we have a whole list of 
13 people that no one knows about because we don't tell

15 speak with someone today, that it stays with us.

18 Okay. 
19 MS. What you hear on the news from 
20 a federal agent or the FBI, it didn't come from us.

22 find out because it may just be rumors. We are not 
23 going to go to the news ever, all right?

5 dreads take off through there? 
6 Uh, yeah, urn, like I said, I'm 
7 on different sides though. Mike Brown is on the 
8 driver's side of the car, so he takes off behind the 
9 vehicle directly in the middle of the road. 
10 MS. Okay. 
11 And his friend, there was a 
12 parked vehicle, and maybe a little bit behind the 
13 police cruiser. 
14 When you point to it, will 
15 that help you a little bit? 
16 The vehicle was leaving right 
17 there. 
18 Okay. 
19 It was actually two buildings. 
20 Okay. 
21 Two buildings. I would say 
22 his friend was in the front and he runs, like I 
23 said, to the very first one to the trunk of it 
24 because the officer gets out of the car and started 
25 shooting and his shooting stance and taking large

1 steps. I don't remember seeing him running. 
2 I'm sorry I cut you off. So 
3 you see this guy with the dreads, where does he 
4 actually go. 
5 He runs, yeah, he runs behind 
6 the trunk of the white car, the first one. 
7 MS. And when he's at the car, what 
8 does he do? 
9 He looked at the officer to 
10 make sure the officer's not coming to him. Because 
11 like each shot that went off, he was like, you know, 
12 ducking each time. 
13 You saw him ducking. So 
14 you're saying that what (inaudible), so can I say 
15 you are assuming what he's doing?

1 ducked down looking at the officer is like each shot 
2 that went off, he was like bam and going around the 
3 building to the passenger side. And then I notice 
4 that the door was opened, I don't know how wide the 
5 door was open, but each shot that went off, he was 
6 kind of like bam, going over to the side watching 
7 him but then I said that I noticed he went past him. 
8 MS. Let me ask you. When you were 
9 watching the guy with the dreads behind the vehicle 
10 (inaudible) as he is going to the passenger side, 
11 did you then leave from your view as he's going to 
12 passenger side? 
13 No, no, no, I could see him 
14 clear, he didn't hop in until, like he didn't hop 
15 into the vehicle until, uh, I think that he noticed 
16 that his friend now did hit the ground. 
17 MS. Did you actually see him hop in 
18 the vehicle. 
19 No, I really didn't because, 
20 urn, I more, when he past, I more started focusing on 
21 the guy that he was shooting at now. 
22

2 they're at different areas of the street, right? 
3 Yes. 
4 MS. Okay. Your intention is 
5 initially on who? 
6 It is on both of them, it's --
7 it's on both of them. 
8 
9 
MS. Okay. 
So, urn, like I said, when -- I 
10 didn't want to leave out that window, I just seen an 
11 officer shooting, and that gets me like, hum. I'm 
12 just thinking that he was going for his friend also. 
13 
14 
MS. And you're assuming that? 
Yeah, I was assuming that, but 
15 I kept my eyes on both of them. I see one running 
16 straight down the middle, this one is going for the 
17 very first car that he sees. 
18 MS. So you see Michael run down the 
19 street and you see the guy with the dreads run down 
20 to the car? 
21 Yeah, the guy with the dreads, 
22 he was the main focus as I'm still noticing that the 
23 officer is shooting straight, but I'm looking at him 
24 is because I'm thinking that the officer, like, uh, 
25 (inaudible) there is a pause, cause there is like a

1 pause by the time he went past this time. So there 
2 is a pause right there during his shooting when, 
3 like I said, I was thinking that he was going to go 
4 to his friend and shoot him. That's why I was main 
5 focusing on him at that point. 
6 MS. So at that point when Mike 
7 Brown starts running, your main focus is on the guy 
8 with the dreads? 
9 Yeah. 
10 MS. And when you see the officer 
11 get out of the car, you're assuming that he's going 
12 after the guy with the dreads? 
13 No, no, no, no, I knew he was 
14 going for Mike Brown, but I kept my eyes on all of 
15 them. 
16 MS. Okay. 
17 Mainly that I see the guy with 
18 the dreads looking at the officer and the officer, 
19 he -- he goes past him. I'm-- I'm sure that the 
20 officer see him where he ran to. 
21 MS. You are sure of that why? 
22 Because when he gets out of 
23 the car, the guy with the dreads, he was already in
