10 internet in order to fill in the blanks; is that 
11 right? 
12 Yes, sir, because like here 
13 I was trying to figure out if that was the gold 
14 thing I seen. This one I remember looking at

16 because I knew it was the hand that had nothing on 
17 it. 
18 Okay. But some of the 
19 details in your account you have had to go back on
