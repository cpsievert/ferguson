12 Q Okay. And now you said today that when 
13 Michael Brown turned around and he put his hand up 
14 and you demonstrate that, that he looked like he was 
15 scared; is that right?

17 Q When you saw that, were you over in this 
18 area when he turned around?

19 The most move he made was running about here. He 
2 0 didn't get much farther than this area. (indicating)

A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. 
They kind of built the memorial on top of 
15 the blood stain that was there. So that's where he 
16 was. 
17 Q So you never saw him from the farthest 
18 point that he was east, you never saw him move 
19 toward the officer? 
20 A I didn't see him move toward the officer. 
21 He could have, but I didn't see him do it.

15 A When I first saw her she was standing 
16 right here in front of her apartment complex. After 
17 I had went in the house and came back out, she was

2 the officer took her phone, did you ever see her on 
3 the news? 
4 A No, I was expecting to see that video, but 
5 I didn't. 
6 Q Okay. Now you describe when you said 
7 Michael Brown turned around and you said it looked 
8 like he was scared and today you used the word 
9 cowering. In previous statements you said it was 
10 like he was crouched over. 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
On your recording from previous statements 
13 we can't see what that means because it's an audio 
14 recording. But you demonstrated today, and XXXXXX 
15 was in between you and I so I didn't have a good 
16 look at it. Can you describe or demonstrate what 
17 you meant when he was crouched over or cowering. 
18 
19 
20 
A 
like this. 
Q 
Okay. It was like his hands were about 
(indicating) 
Can you stand up? He was standing up at 
21 this point, right? 
22 A Yes. His shoulders were like almost 
23 touching his hands, urn. No, that's kind of like the 
24 stance for self-defense to me. So that's how I said 
25 crouched over.

2 FBI agents and the assistant U.S. attorney, remember 
3 the guy with black hair that you talked to, the 
4 attorney? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And you said to him that Michael 
7 Brown was kind of crouching over and it sounded to 
8 me like maybe you were trying to demonstrate it and 
9 you said, so kind of bent over? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q When you demonstrated it to them, was your 
12 body bent over in any way?

And then you see him run. Does the 
3 officer fire at Michael Brown while he's running 
4 away? 
5 A That I don't remember. I wasn't paying 
6 attention at that point. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A It is from the time that the officer got 
9 out of the car from the gun, or whatever it was on 
10 the ground being picked up or whatever, that part 
11 I'm not sure. 
12 Q Okay. And just to be clear, you said from 
13 the gun being picked up off the ground, but you 
14 don't know for sure what was on the ground; is that 
15 right? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q It was black? 
18 A Yes, it was black. It made like kind of a 
19 plastic metal clink when it hit the ground. That's

3 Q You didn't see who picked it up, you just 
4 know that later it was gone? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Did you see, as the boys were first 
7 walking toward the car, after the officer backed up 
8 and the boys approached the car, did you see 
9 anything in Michael Brown's hands? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Did you ever see Michael Brown hand 
12 anything to the little guy? 
13 A No, I wasn't paying attention. 
14 Q Okay. So just cause you were kind of 
15 talking softly, you said, no, you weren't paying 
16 that close of attention? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Okay. And so after the first gunshot and 
19 Michael Brown backs away, kind of checks himself out 
20 looks like and then he starts to run away, you say 
21 he gets a few steps before he turns around, did you 
22 hear any shots before he turns around?

said he took a few steps, half steps 
just like a little shuffle. 
And then did it appear to you that 
5 he had been shot at that point, could you see? 
6 A I couldn't tell, that was too far for 
7 that. 
8 Q Okay. And then you heard several shots in 
9 a row after that? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after those several shots in a

14 but it wasn't.

1 trying to get some idea on this distance here. If 
2 we can probably put it in terms of car lengths, like 
3 a four-door vehicle, can you picture that in your 
4 mind? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
Okay. Now, when you 
7 started off, when you saw the officer's car, can you 
8 give me an idea how many cars, 4-door cars can fit 
9 between where the police officer's car is and where 
10 you are when you first see him? 
11 A Okay. It will be about probably four or 
12 five car lengths. 
13 
14 lengths, okay. 
15 
16 
A Yes. 
Okay. Four to five car 
Okay. And then when you 
17 got to, were you still at that point when you heard 
18 the first shot go off? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. When I heard the first shot, 
20 I was still by the tree. 
21 Okay. Then when you're at 
22 the bank of the mailboxes, okay, are you still, 
23 okay, where are they then? 
24 A They're still in the same place about 
25 right here. They're still in the same area.

2 Okay. And so from there 
3 to where they are, about how many car lengths would 
4 that be you think? 
5 A From where I was to the police car? From 
6 where I was here to the police car? 
7 Yeah. 
8 A I was closer, I was probably about two or 
9 three car lengths. 
10 Two to three car lengths. 
11 And then at that point you're there about two or 
12 three car lengths, at that point that's when you see 
13 Michael Brown, you see the other bank of shots or 
14 the other shots go off? 
A Yes. 15 
16 Okay. I think that's all 
17 I have. 
18 Okay. On 
19 August the 16th, your interview when you told the 
20 authorities that you were walking home from the 
21 library, you first said that you saw the police 
22 officer back-back, you know, not hard but --

3 You said that, okay, what I need to understand, 
4 cause you are on the same side as them, right? 
5 A I'm on the opposite side of the street. 
6 At the time when you saw 
7 the police? 
8 A Yes, during everything I was on the 
9 opposite side of the street from the police car. 
10 Opposite side would be 
11 A This side of the street. The car was on 
12 this side of the street, parked about right here at 
13 first. (indicating) 
14 Okay. Let me rephrase the 
15 question, you are so right. You are facing the same 
16 side as you are facing to the back of everything 
17 that's going on. 
18 A Yeah, well, I'm facing towards the front 
19 of the police car, but I'm facing the back of the 
20 police officer, but while he was getting shot, I was 
21 still facing toward Michael Brown. 
22 Right. My point is, when 
23 you saw the action going on at the car and the 
24 vehicle, I call it MB and PO, police officer. Did 
25 it look to you when he came back at that quick stop,

1 even though they may have almost gotten hit, you 
2 know, and they jump back, how soon would you say 
3 that the action between MB and the PO took place? 
4 A How soon did he walk up to the car window? 
5 Cause when you say walk up 
6 to the car, I'm thinking somebody almost got hit, 
7 it's like it's right here, I mean, it is like 
8 instant, it is right directly in front of me? 
9 A Yes. 
10 It would be like boom, 
11 boom, you know. 
12 A Uh-huh. 
13 Just a jerk more than not 
14 jump far back. 
15 A Right. 
16 But when you say walk up 
17 to the police car, did he have to like walk some 
18 feet? 
19 A No, just walk from the back of the car to 
20 the driver's window. It wasn't like a walk, it was 
21 just like, you know, probably like three steps. He 
22 was already there by the car. He just walked from 
23 the bumper to the driver's window. 
24 How soon did the 
25 conversation that you did not hear take place?

A How soon after he backed up the car? 
Yeah. 
1 
2 
3 A Urn, like less than five seconds. It was 
4 like instant after that happened, he just charged 
5 right up to the window, he just went right over. 
6 So, and you said that you 
7 saw his body waist up in the car? 
8 A About his arms, shoulders right here like, 
9 you know, somebody reaching, he's reaching in there. 
10 Like they're in there fighting, he's reaching for 
11 something but he's doing something in the car. 
12 His head and chest was 
13 inside the vehicle too? 
14 A His head was in the vehicle at one point 
15 reaching in. 
16 On August the 16th you 
17 never mention that his body was inside the vehicle, 
18 but on September 25th you mention that his body was 
19 inside. You just said that it was his arm, it 
20 looked like they were fighting. 
21 So I'm just confused because like that's a 
22 big gap, that's almost like a month after you had 
23 your first interview. Did you like hear anything on 
24 television or hear anyone in the neighborhood 
25 talking about, you know, what they actually saw?

2 be off, but it was like a grapple, you know, head 
3 bobbing and shoulders moving, arms moving. 
4 Okay. Thank you. 
5 Continuing on 
6 that same thought. You know the car backs up, 
7 nearly hits Michael Brown and Dorian. You said

9 seconds or so, to the driver's side of the car.

15 When you 
16 moved from the tree to the mailbox, were you walking

5 are watching the ground as much as maybe you are

9 reaching in. His whole top half in the window and 
10 popping back out? 
11 A (Nods head.) 
12 And then the one from the 
13 25th, basically to me it looks like you are saying 
14 the same thing. I want to make sure that I'm 
15 reading this correctly. 
16 A Okay. 
17 When he saw him go into 
18 the window, it seemed like he just ran. And then 
19 one of the lady officers, she says, was he in the 
20 window or parts of his body inside the window. And 
21 you said yeah, like his head and shoulders were. 
22 And you said yes, that's what it looked like. 
23 And then later you said you saw Michael 
24 Brown, you said his whole top half in the window and 
25 you said yes, just about.

I want to make sure I'm understanding. 
A Yes. 
3 His head, shoulders and 
4 arms were in the window? 
5 A Yes. 
6 And that's what you said 
7 in both statements. 
8 A Yes. 
9 You said here, did you 
10 see the police officer's face after Michael Brown 
11 left the scene and the officer was getting out? 
12 
13 
A After Mike Brown left the scene? 
After Mike Brown was 
14 running away and the officer got out of the car, did 
15 you see the officer's face? 
16 A No, no. 
17 You didn't see if it was 
18 bruised or anything? 
19 A No, I couldn't tell. I didn't even see 
20 him really get out of the car. When I looked up he 
21 was already out. 
22 Do you know if Michael 
23 Brown reached for his chest or under his waistband?

Michael Brown. 
3 In one of the statements 
4 the first two shots you didn't see? 
5 A A couple of them I wasn't looking, but I 
6 heard them ring back, to back, to back. After it 
7 had to be like, I don't remember exactly, but they 
8 were back to back. After about the third one, I did 
9 look and see. 
10 And you said to officer 
11 or district attorney, whatever her name is, 
12 , in one of your statements that you had looked 
13 away. And she said, if I told you we had evidence 
14 that he moved forward toward the police officer, 
15 what would you say about that. You said that might 
16 have been one of the times I was looking away. 
17 A Yeah. 
18 So I understand, you're 
19 doing very well by the way, there's a lot going on, 
20 you are scared? 
A There was a lot going on. 21 
22 I understand, Hon. I 
23 just want to make sure just because you are saying 
24 you didn't see it, doesn't necessarily mean it 
25 didn't happen.

1 A Right, right, that's the point I tried to 
2 make. 
3 Okay. You said today 
4 that you felt like this was murder. Can I ask you 
5 how you felt, I want you to put yourself in the 
6 officer's position. I want you to tell us what you 
7 think he should have done? 
8 A Okay. I mean, even if I heard that people 
9 said that he reached in the truck, even if he did 
10 attack you, he was unarmed. I feel like at the 
11 point he tried to surrender, he could have put 
12 handcuffs on him. They could have maced him, that's 
13 why they have those nightsticks, that's why you have 
14 all these other options. 
15 This is a boy who has no weapons at 
16 all, you exhaust your other options. Injure him, 
17 but why kill him. 
18 Thank you so much. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question. 
20 I can't remember from your previous statements, but 
21 you've never heard the officer yelling any commands 
22 or anything, did you? 
23 A

1 MS. ALIZADEH: This thought just now 
2 occurred to me because you are a young person. And 
3 I've never asked anybody else, but did you have 
4 headphones or ear buds that day as you were walking 
5 back from the library? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Kids walk around with 
8 headphones on, so you didn't have anything in your 
9 ears? 
10 A No, I just wasn't really, I mean, it was a 
11 lot of noise, a lot of commotion. It's usually a 
12 lot of noise over there. So if they weren't where 
13 they were, I probably wouldn't have heard it. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: You didn't hear any 
15 screaming from anybody? 
16 A No, I wasn't paying attention to it. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
18 A Like I said, it's a possibility they could 
19 have been, but I didn't catch anything or anything I 
20 would remember word for word. 
21 
22 
MS. ALIZADEH: All right, thank you. 
23 I have one more question. You said that you saw 
24 something hit the ground, you thought it was a 
25 weapon?

1 A Yes. 
2 And I understand now we 
3 know that Michael Brown was not armed? 
4 A Yes. 
5 But at the time we didn't 
6 know that, correct? 
7 A Right. At first I thought it was his gun, 
8 like I thought that's what hit the ground. 
9 So it is reasonable to 
10 think the police officer might think he has a gun. 
11 I'm not saying that he deserved what happened to 
12 him, we just didn't know that? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Thank you. 
15 You just 
16 stated to the prosecutor that you never heard the 
17 officer yell out any commands. When Mr. Brown was, 
18 you know, shots were going towards Mr. Brown, the 
19 last what six shots or whatever, did you at any time 
20 hear him cry out anything or cry out even in pain? 
21 
22

24 
A No. 
No. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? Sheila? 
MS. WHIRLEY: No. That will conclude the 
25 testimony of this witness.

11 long. With that said, XXXXXXX, stop the recording. 
12 Who are the other people 
13 listed on here? 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: We didn't do these 
15 transcripts. I'm not sure how, why all of these 
16 folks spoke. This is what I did notice and you will 
17 notice it when you hear the transcript, hear the 
18 recording, there are several people at the house. 
19 I'm glad you asked that question. Actually, there 
20 are several people at the house, and then they kind 
21 of isolate and the bulk of the 
22 testimony is from her, but a few other people are 
23 speaking. 
24 They may be family 
25 members or bystanders?
