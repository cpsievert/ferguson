3 Thursday, November 13th at 9:26 a.m. This is Kathi 
4 Alizadeh of the prosecutor's office, Sheila Whirley 
5 is present, all 12 grand jurors are present, as is 
6 the court reporter. And I apologize, we're kind of 
7 getting a late start. We have our first witness in 
8 the morning here. We've had to meet with him a bit 
9 and he's reviewing some materials right now and then 
10 we had a discussion briefly before going on the 
11 record this morning about scheduling and about what 
12 might be in store for today. And then for the dates 
13 in the future that you have already given us and so 
14 with that being said, we'll just start the day and 
15 Sheila will take the first witness of the day who is 
16 Dr. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: He's looking at some 
18 photographs, so he needs just a few more minutes. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. We'll go ahead

A Good morning.

11 Q And I just want to reiterate on the record 
12 for the grand jurors that we had already talked 
13 about, you know, that you're not supposed to discuss 
14 anything that we talk about here in the grand jury, 
15 correct? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q And that even any fact which the 
18 foreperson mentioned, any fact or thing that may 
19 come to your knowledge that you've discussed here at 
20 all.

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are you a forensic pathologist? 
Yes. 
What exactly --
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, for the record, I 
10 don't think he said his name. We haven't had him 
11 introduced. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: We had talked a little bit 
13 about that, I guess I skipped that step. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Please introduce yourself 
15 and say your name and spell your name? 
16 A 
17 Q And in the future what I'm going to try to 
18 do and that's probably why I skipped asking, I'm 
19 going to refer to you as doctor and not use your 
20 name for many reasons. 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Okay, thank you. 
Getting back to forensic pathology. What 
23 does that mean? 
24 A Pathology is one of the 24 specialties in 
25 medicine, like OBGYN, dermatology, surgery, 
FAX 314-241-6750

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Grand Jury, Volume XXIII November 13, 2014 
Page 8 
1 pathology is a specialty that deals with finding out 
2 what's wrong with the body as opposed to treatment. 
3 So we're the doctors in the hospital 
4 who run the laboratory to see what the blood count 
5 is, what the PSA is, what the liver chemistries are 
6 and tell the treating doctors if there is evidence 
7 of liver disease or kidney disease or prostate 
8 problems, and that's the pathologist's role in the 
9 hospital communicating with doctors who are treating 
10 patients. 
11 Also, the pathologist's role is 
12 looking at biopsies, you know, breast biopsies, skin 
13 biopsies, to tell the treating doctor what kind of 
14 condition, cancer, not cancer, something else. And 
15 then the treating doctor does the treatment. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A So there are a number of divisions in 
18 pathology. The biggest division is hospital 
19 pathology. Where the pathologist looks at the 
20 biopsies, do autopsies, find out what's wrong with 
21 the patient, look at the chemistry of the body. 
22 And there are separate examinations, 
23 board examinations so that in all 24 fields, so that 
24 a patient looking for a doctor can tell whether the 
25 dermatologist has passed his boards or not and all

1 the specialties have to do you have to show the 
2 right training in the medical school, the right 
3 training in the residency program and pass various 
4 exams. And if so, then one is a diplomate or board 
5 certified physician, and that's of importance for 
6 others to know the extent of expertise that person 
7 has before going to the doctor. 
8 Pathology has three big divisions 
9 that I'm involved with. One is anatomical 
10 pathology, which has to do with the anatomy of the 
11 body. That's where autopsies, looking at biopsies 
12 under the microscope and tissues under the 
13 microscope, is evaluated to see what the anatomical 
14 structure of the body is and what's normal or not, 
15 that's anatomical pathology. 
16 Second division will be clinical 
17 pathology, which has to do with the chemistry of the 
18 body to see what's the blood count and the urine 
19 testing, et cetera, which gives us information about 
20 body function or organ functions. 
21 And that's the prime role in 
22 hospitals, anatomical and clinical pathology. 
23 Forensic pathology goes a step further to look into 
24 unnatural deaths, accident, suicide, homicide.

1 about my background. I served as medical examiner 
2 in New York City for 25 years, including the role of 
3 chief medical examiner in New York City. And then I 
4 transferred to the State of New York and I was chief 
5 forensic pathologist for the New York State Police 
6 for some 25 years. 
7 Recently retired, and I'm in private 
8 practice of forensic pathology. 
9 Q How many years total would you have in 
10 experience? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
More than 50 years. 
Okay. Have you any experience, are you a 
13 toxicologist also? 
14 A No, I'm not a toxicologist who specializes 
15 in finding drugs, but all forensic pathologists have 
16 to be experts in interpreting what the toxicologist 
17 finds. So the toxicologist's role is largely 
18 chemistry and finding drugs, finding quantities, how 
19 much of the drug is present, but it is really the 
20 physician, medical doctor who interprets the results 
21 and sees how it affects any illness the person has 
22 or affects what treatment should be given.

24 your training in pathology?

6 Q I didn't ask you to bring your CV with you 
7 today, would you happen to have a CV of your 
8 training experience with you?

10 you this afternoon.

12 that to get that later. 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q So tell us, you already told us how many 
15 autopsies you performed, tell us exactly what is an 
16 autopsy? 
17 A Autopsy is a systematic external and 
18 internal examination of the human body to determine 
19 any abnormalities that might be present and any 
20 information that might be useful in determining 
21 cause of death of how a person died.

23 specimens for toxicology, for DNA, for microscopic

1 death and the circumstances around death. 
2 Q We're here today because of the shooting 
3 of Michael Brown and we've asked you to come before 
4 us because you actually did what sounds like was a 
5 private autopsy on Michael Brown; is that correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q You were aware that he had a first autopsy 
8 that was performed by St. Louis County?

Q

Yes.

12 Do you recall when you would have 
13 done your autopsy, what date that would have been? 
14 A Yes, it was Sunday, I came on Sunday 
15 around August, hold on a second. About August 17th, 
16 I guess, August 17th of this year.

1 Q How did you get invited to do that 
2 autopsy, or how did you examine become involved in 
3 that? 
4 A As I recall, I was called by an attorney 
5 for the family, Mr. was the attorney for the 
6 family, and he called me and asked if I could come 
7 and do a second autopsy. 
8 Q And now that you are in private practice, 
9 how long have you been in private practice? 
10 A Well, part of being a medical examiner, my 
11 50 years starting in New York City was to do private 
12 practice in addition to medical examiner work in 
13 part because traditionally medical examiners always 
14 work for counties and always got paid less than 
15 other doctors, they make up on it, you can do some 
16 private work. So I do private work also, but since 
17 2012, I think, I've been doing more private work 
18 when I retired from the State Police. 
19 Q And does that consist of you doing second 
20 autopsies generally?

1 optionies, doing first autopsies, and testifying 
2 about the findings sometimes. 
3 Q Now, and you mention money, so that kind 
4 of prompts me to ask this question. Were you paid 
5 to do this autopsy concerning Michael Brown? 
6 A No, I am doing this pro bono and about a 
7 third of the work I do is pro bono. 
8 Q How do you make that decision what's going 
9 to be pro bono? 
10 A A lot of that is how much, whether the 
11 family can afford it or not. If an autopsy is 
12 indicated, then I would work it out if they can't 
13 afford to pay anything, do it for pro bono and that 
14 involves a lot of work for families and for 
15 institutions, some institutions. 
16 You have to pay for the 
17 expenses of the travel and the hotel here or the 
18 family pay for that? 
19 A Urn, my expenses coming and going is paid 
20 for by the attorneys. They pay for that, yes.

22 Q 
Thank you. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Where did you perform 
23 your autopsy at?

1 recall, the Lane Funeral Home who had been hired by 
2 the family to do the burial services. 
3 Q Was the body embalmed when you made 
4 contact with the body for the first time? 
5 A Yes, when I saw the body on Sunday, the 
6 17th, the body had already been embalmed. 
7 Q Does that affect your finding in any way? 
8 A It does have an affect. I prefer to do 
9 autopsies without embalming. One, it interferes 
10 with a lot of toxicology if that were needed because 
11 the embalming process changes the chemical makeup of 
12 the body. 
13 But also it changes the way injuries 
14 look, the embalming process is largely formaldehyde, 
15 replacing blood in the body, does change the 
16 appearance of the wounds on the body and so to that 
17 extent. 
18 Q Did you feel that you were able to look at 
19 the body, and I'm sure I'll ask you in a minute, all 
20 the documents and information that you have viewed 
21 or inspected to come up with your findings, did you 
22 feel that you were able to make an accurate finding 
23 though based on even the body being embalmed 
24 already? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I thought I could make an approximate

1 finding. 
2 
3 
4 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
I could tell bullet holes. 
Okay. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 17 
5 A For example, but some bullet holes may be 
6 difficult to tell entrance or exit after the body is 
7 embalmed. And certain injuries are diminished in 
8 appearance because the embalming process takes out 
9 color from the body, it causes the color to be gray 
10 in the body, more so than during life. 
11 Q Tell us what information, documents or 
12 things that you inspected to come up with your 
13 finding, and you did not write a report. You just 
14 recently viewed some things that were necessary; is 
15 that right? 
16 A Yesterday I viewed a lot of materials that 
17 are important in arriving at conclusions. So what 
18 I'm telling you today incorporates much of what I 
19 saw yesterday. 
20 Q Tell us everything you viewed to come to 
21 your conclusions? 
22 A Initially, initially, I do the decedent, 
23 Mr. Brown, who had already been autopsied, that also 
24 changes, the autopsy itself can change appearance of 
25 injuries and wounds, especially things that are

1 removed from the body. Obviously, bullets are 
2 removed. We can't see where the bullets wound up, 
3 but we see the spaces where they were. 
4 The organs are dissected, there are 
5 changes in appearance of wounds just on the basis of 
6 the first autopsy and the embalming adds onto it. 
7 So I asked at the beginning, and 
8 yesterday I was able to see the following of those. 
9 Went to the Medical Examiner's Office, very 
10 courteous and professional. They have photographs 
11 and x-rays, they took a lot of x-rays. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
What do the x-rays help you with? 
The x-rays show what the body looked like 
14 before the autopsy was done. The x-ray was taken 
15 before, about 30 x-rays or so. They show fractures 
16 that were there because sometimes during an autopsy 
17 the person doing the autopsy causes fractures, 
18 necessary to open up the chest cage and things. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And so the x-rays are the best indicator 
21 where the bullets are, can see right where the 
22 bullets were, which bones were intact and which 
23 bones were fractured before the incisions were made. 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I see. 
The autopsy is done with two incisions.

1 One for the chest and abdomen, and one for the head. 
2 And that, so that was helpful. There 
3 were x-rays and photographs. The photographs, 
4 though, at the Medical Examiner's Office were all 
5 after the first autopsy was done. That is after the 
6 autopsy sutures and all and went from the Medical 
7 Examiner's Office to the police department and there 
8 was able to view the autopsies (sic) the police took 
9 and they took many photographs of the body before 
10 the autopsy was done. They were extremely helpful. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
13 helpful. 
14 Q 
15 A 
We have some of those photographs. 
Yes, I went through some that might be 
Okay. 
And that answered a lot of questions I had 
16 as to entrance, exit, closeness of the gun at the 
17 time of discharge. 
18 I also looked at clothing, the 
19 clothing was very important. Clothing is always, 
20 the two most important to the hospital pathologist, 
21 90 percent, 95 percent of pathologists in the 
22 country, hospital pathologists, the most important 
23 part of an autopsy is internal organ, the heart, the 
24 brain, the lungs, kidneys, they're important, that's 
25 where natural diseases occur.

1 To the forensic pathologist the most 
2 important is the skin, that's where we see all 
3 patterns of injury, we see forensic evidence, trace 
4 evidence, blood, hairs, fiber, semen, saliva, that 
5 can be on the outside of the body. 
6 And the skin, the clothing is part of 
7 the skin to us because the clothing and the skin 
8 contain patterns of injury, gunshot powders, cut 
9 wounds, and also trace evidence.

12 photographs that were taken by the police and in the 
13 body in the virgin state for us. Having not been 
14 washed or touched or anything and the clothing. 
15 Q The clothing, the x-rays, the body, you 
16 actually saw the body? 
17 A Yes. 
Q Did you review the reports from, well, 
from Dr. 's report?

1 officially released. I'm always concerned about 
2 leaked information as to how accurate it is. And 
3 yesterday when I went to the Medical Examiner's 
4 Office, I was provided with an official copy with 
5 the gross autopsies, the microscopic studies and 
6 toxicology, which turned out to be pretty similar to 
7 what had come out before, but the family still has a 
8 copy too. If I may interject. 
9 Q Sure.

11 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm sorry, if you may what? 
A Interject about the family. The reason 
12 that I was called by Mr. , you know, a week 
13 later rather than right away, sometimes families are 
14 concerned about a death, they want a second autopsy, 
15 they don't trust the first one necessarily, they 
16 call the next day. The reason that there was a week 
17 delayed as explained to me is that the family had 
18 been waiting for some information about the death, 
19 cause of death, for example. 
20 And also I find, in all our work as 
21 medical examiners when we see next of kin and 
22 whether it's everyday work or situation like this, 
23 one of the questions the family often has is did he 
24 suffer, did my loved one suffer in dying. 
25 One of our job as medical examiners

1 is explain what happened and to try to make it as 
2 less suffering as possible, make them feel a little 
3 bit the art of being a medical examiner. 
4 In this incident they hadn't heard 
5 anything, they read the stuff in the newspaper. The 
6 reason I came down was to do my examination because 
7 they didn't know they were going to get information 
8 as to cause of death. They know he was shot, they 
9 didn't know how much he was shot and where he was 
10 shot. To this day they still haven't received a 
11 report. I got it yesterday, the family hasn't 
12 gotten an official report so that's one of the 
13 reasons why families get a second autopsy. I'm a 
14 great believer in media transparency, that's another 
15 topic. 
16 So when I met with the family that 
17 was the first question was, did he suffer. I 
18 explained when that, one of bullet wounds in the top 
19 of the head went through the brain, that immediately 
20 caused him to lose consciousness. So that made them 
21 feel a little better he wasn't laying around in 
22 pain. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A Then I gave my opinion about at least six, 
25 there was a press conference that occurred the next

1 day, that there were from what I could see at least 
2 six bullets struck the body.

A 
Q 
A 
We're going to get to that. 
So that's 
Okay. 
Even though I hadn't had all the new 
7 information, I'll paraphrase it, that's the kind of 
8 information I could give. 
9 Q Since you have gotten some additional 
10 information as recent as yesterday, that doesn't 
11 change your opinion as to how many shots the body 
12 received though? 
13 A No, I think that in going over everything, 
14 my opinion now is that there were seven bullets that 
15 struck the body. 
16 Q We'll go through that in just a minute. 
17 So you did get a chance to review the medical 
18 examiner's report and also the toxicology report; is 
19 that correct?

Q You determined it was a hand wound? 
A Well, yes, but they told me that. 
Q Someone told you it was a hand wound? You 
4 didn't make that determination? In your opinion was 
5 it a hand wound? 
6 A Yes, yes. Slides, you know, are labeled, 
7 so that, and the only slide because that was the 
8 only slides they took. 
9 Q Okay. 
10 A They didn't do microscopic examine of the 
11 heart, lung, all of that, which is usually done. 
12 The only sections that they make slides out of was 
13 the right-hand wound. 
14 Q We have photos of that?

16 car, the police car.

Yes.

2 helpful in you explaining the injuries to Michael 
3 Brown, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Okay. Let me ask you before I go into the 
6 photos, did anyone assist you with your, with the 
7 autopsy?

10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Who assisted you? 
There was a young man named 
Is he also a medical examiner or a doctor? 
No, no, he was a person that had been 
13 hired before I got there, it was days before I got 
14 there. Who was an assist to the autopsy. Everybody 
15 in an autopsy needs an assistant, often the funeral 
16 director to help move the body and things like that. 
17 And in this instance they had 
18 engaged, I'm not sure what this young man who was to 
19 assist. 
20 Q Because you didn't hire him, he wasn't 
21 someone on your team that you brought in? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Had you met him before? 
Not that I recall. He brought a

1 student, not medical student, at the University of 
2 Kansas and I came to the University of Kansas to do 
3 an autopsy in some controversial matter that he was 
4 a student, had worked summers at the medical 
5 examiner's office there and he was there. I signed 
6 a picture for him and he brought the picture and to 
7 remind me, he was, I think, a college student at 
8 that time.

Q 
A 
11 anything. 
12 Q 
Okay. 
But I had never worked with him or 
I see. So let's go back to the funeral 
13 home that Sunday. Was it early in the morning when 
14 you went to the funeral home that Sunday to do the 
15 autopsy? 
16 A I came in early morning by plane from New 
17 York and I guess it was 11:00, 12:00, 1:00 when I 
18 started the autopsy. I was picked up at the airport 
19 in St. Louis and brought down to the funeral home 
20 and shortly thereafter, began the re-autopsy. 
21 Q Re-autopsy. How long do you think that 
22 re-autopsy took? 
23 A Oh, probably about four hours or so, plus 
24 or minus an hour, take a few hours.

When you first saw the body, what

1 condition was it in? I know it was embalmed, I 
2 mean, was it ready for autopsy or was, go ahead. 
3 A The body had been, the body had been in 
4 the funeral parlor long enough to be embalmed, so it 
5 had been there for a few days. The body was on a 
6 table, one of the embalming tables in the funeral 
7 parlor similar to autopsy tables ready for 
8 re-autopsy. 
9 Q What does that look like when you say 
10 ready for re-autopsy? 
11 A I think it was, I don't recall 
12 specifically, a sheet over the body, a white sheet. 
13 When I removed the sheet, the body was on the metal, 
14 the top of the autopsy table and nude. 
Q Was it sutured or not? 15 
16 A The body was sutured. There are two 
17 incisions that are made in an autopsy, one is what 
18 is called the Y shaped incision. It goes from left 
19 shoulder down to the breast bone and the right
