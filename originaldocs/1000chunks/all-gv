2 Jennings, in our police department, 
3 we have mobile data computer terminals. You can 
4 always look back and look up the policy while you 
5 are on the call or anything of that nature to refer 
6 to. 
7 So you go over that policy and then 
8 for myself, I would go through scenarios like after 
9 we have been on a call. I would play the what if 
10 game and have him articulate to me what he would 
11 have done in this situation. What if this occurred, 
12 how would you handle it and play the what if game. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So there's written 
14 policy and then you kind of do hypotheticals to 
15 verify his knowledge of what he knows what he needs 
16 to do. 
17 What did you or your department do to 
18 assist Officer Wilson with working with the 
19 African-American community? You said that he 
20 actually asked you, told you that he wanted to work 
21 with the community or he didn't know much about 
22 African-Americans and I guess wanted to be a better 
23 officer in the African-American community, what kind 
24 of assistance was he given?

5 I've encountered. What is important to the 
6 community. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: What is important to the 
8 community? 
9 A One of the biggest issues I've seen with 
10 young law enforcement they don't take a vested 
11 interest in the community. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear 
13 the last one? 
14 A They don't take a vested interest in the 
15 community they work in. We go to work every day, 
16 the residences are throughout, not usually in the 
17 community you work in. And you come there for 12 
18 hours a day, you go home. 
19 The residents, that's where they 
20 live, that's their home base and it is really 
21 important you take a vested interest in that. When 
22 you do, your job is a lot easier. I think it is 
23 better with the relations with the residents and on 
24 your calls. You understand things.

15 the question. What kind of things did you do to 
16 help Officer Wilson understand how to work better 
17 with the African-American community? 
18 A I know you don't want to talk about 
19 Normandy, but I was a school resource officer there. 
20 In Jennings a lot of the residents that I had as a 
21 school resource officer in Normandy were now 
22 residents of Jennings. I would go to those 
23 communities on a call.

2 check on her once a week after I had been on a call 
3 there. How you doing. I was able to when she was 
4 not on her medication talk to her and get her back 
5 on medication. That's taking a vested interest in 
6 the community. It is not just going to the call and 
7 answering it and writing the report and leaving. 
8 It is going back on a stolen car, did 
9 you get your car back, you know, did you get it 
10 fixed, things of that nature. That's taking a 
11 vested interest in the community.

MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
As a school resource officer I was able to 
14 show him that he was always teased, everybody knows 
15 you. When I was a school resource officer, I did 
16 the adopt a student. I would take them to the 
17 basketball games. I took them to those things when 
18 they came up. That's taking a vested interest in

2 African-American community? 
3 A Yeah, I've seen him buy meals for the 
4 youth, I've seen him follow-up on calls, go and talk 
5 to the residents, you know. He wasn't encompassed 
6 in that police car, he was out and about in the 
7 community. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Questions? 
9 What type of behavioral 
10 screening is there in the academy or maybe you as a 
11 trainer, are there warning signs, certain 
12 personality types that you would fail them from 
13 becoming an officer just because of behavioral 
14 issues, you understand? 
15 A We have, I know for the City of Jennings 
16 you have to go through a psych evaluation before you 
17 can even be hired on the department, and that's 
18 where that is determined. 
19 As far as myself, of course, if you 
20 have anger issues. The person's mental state is not 
21 stable, they can't control their emotions or things 
22 of that nature. That's the concern. That's where 
23 you address those issues. That's in your

15 personally. Do you look for anything personally on 
16 a personal level with a new officer that you might 
17 feel would be a concern? 
18 A Biggest thing for me I want to see in an 
19 officer the ability to communicate. That's the 
20 biggest part of our job communication. I look for 
21 that. I want to see can they, the problem solving, 
22 how are they, do they look outside the box. Those

16 A Every officer there was laid off. They 
17 disbanded the police department.

1 on the same shift. 
2 Are you familiar with a term 
3 that was used, use of force triangle, or use of 
4 force continuum? 
5 A Yes, sir. 
6 Can you describe what that 
7 means? 
8 A Basically it is teaching the officers a 
9 suspect can, basically what level of force do you 
10 need to use to control the situation. Not using the 
11 least amount, but to get it done effectively and get 
12 compliance. 
13 To simplify it, you have your just 
14 compliance, officer present, they're compliant. 
15 That was in the triangle, you have that in the 
16 center. And you have threatening resistent, which 
17 will be physically attack. Nonthreatening, which 
18 would be noncompliance. I'm not moving, I'm staying 
19 here. Then you have deadly force, but all goes back 
20 to the center of that triangle to where compliance 
21 is. 
22 You teach the officer, the suspect is 
23 who decides what happens. They're the one who makes 
24 the decision. Everything within the force continuum 
25 is reactive on our part. It is a delicate equation,

1 though, you have to decide what force do I need to 
2 use, but I don't want to use excessive force, but I 
3 don't want to use too little force to where someone 
4 gets hurt also. 
5 Sometimes if you use too less of a 
6 force, then you have to use another avenue, say 
7 mace, you use that. You should have used something 
8 more forceful. You have to go to the time that's 
9 two encounters, two uses of force. Basically where 
10 you used your baton from the beginning that would 
11 have gotten the compliance. 
12 This is something that is 
13 taught to the officers in all of their training, 
14 academy type of training? 
15 A That's taught in the academy, there's also 
16 continued training. Any time that you go to the 
17 academy in the State of Missouri you have to do 48 
18 hours of continuing training every three years. Any 
19 time you have any class using your firearm. Any 
20 defensive tactics or anything, that's brought back

1 experience would it be your opinion to say that in a 
2 very tight compressed time situation that that was 
3 something that an officer would instinctively fall 
4 back onto? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
Thank you. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question for you. 
8 In either the police academy training or in what you 
9 might train as being a field training officer, if an 
10 officer is faced, finds himself in a situation and 
11 he makes a decision to use deadly force to react to 
12 something that he sees is a threat to himself or the 
13 community, is there any training in the police 
14 academy or in field training where you, the officer, 
15 is taught or instructed to, for example, if you are 
16 going to use your firearm to like shoot at their 
17 legs or shoot at an area of their body that might 
18 not be a fatal shot? 
19 In other words 
20 A All training you are taught to in your 
21 firearms training to aim towards center mass to stop 
22 the threat. Your goal, again, is compliance, stop 
23 the threat. It is not to aim for the leg in high 
24 stress situation, you're not able to do that 
25 physically.

1 Also, in trying to stop the threat, 
2 the only way that the end of use firearm that you 
3 would stop the threat immediately without their 
4 willingness to comply would be something that 
5 strikes the central nervous system. A shot in the 
6 leg and they are still able to attack you and do 
7 harm to you. You can take a shot to the heart and 
8 still basically fight for up to 30 seconds easily, a 
9 minute. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So it is a part of 
11 training if you are reacting to a threat that you 
12 deem you need to use a firearm to meet that threat, 
13 you aim for the center mass? 
14 A Correct. When I say center mass, whatever 
15 is exposed, whatever you have. It is not always 
16 going to be just the chest, it is going to be 
17 whatever is exposed that you are aiming at. 
18 We heard about two 
19 African-American police officers out of 40 
20 something, can you tell me the number of 
21 African-Americans that apply?

1 the academy, what was the dynamics? 
2 A We had no African-American officers in my 
3 academy class. 
4 You said that you were 
5 trained to hit at center mass, okay. And I've heard 
6 a lot of people in the media talk about why didn't 
7 the police officer just let him run away and put an 
8 all points bulletin on him. Can you tell me about 
9 your training as far as not just your safety, but as 
10 far as the community, would that be against what you 
11 would be taught in the academy, just let a suspect 
12 go and get him later? 
13 A No, ma'am. That's our job as a police 
14 officer to apprehend suspects. Whenever somebody 
15 has a crime committed or anything, they call us, we 
16 are the ones that have to respond while everybody 
17 else is trying to get away from the area. It is our 
18 duty to protect the community. That's what we swear 
19 to when we we're hired. And in doing so, you have 
20 to prevent a suspect from fleeing, then they can do 
21 further harm to the community. 
22 No, you're not taught to shy away 
23 from that. We always respond, that's our job and we

1 protocol, kind of step by step protocol of making an 
2 arrest? 
3 A From what part? 
4 I guess the point at which 
5 an officer determines there is a cause for arrest 
6 and then what kind of protocol is going forth? 
7 A Each agency has their own policy. I can 
8 give you a general rundown. As an officer you 
9 observe or probable cause to believe that a crime 
10 has been committed. And in doing so for speeding, 
11 you write them a ticket. Some agencies have 
12 policies that you have to arrest people for certain 
13 offenses, which even could be something to write a 
14 ticket for driving while suspended. If you observe 
15 the crime, you take your enforcement action. You 
16 write your report to articulate everything about 
17 that incident, the elements of the crime. 
18 So as far as the arrest part, that's 
19 where that comes in when you apprehend the suspect. 
20 From there most agencies you go to 
21 the station, complete the booking process. Usually 
22 in the municipalities the judges have a bond 
23 schedule, who has to post bond. Some are released 
24 on a summons after they are processed and you see if 
25 they have warrants, if they have to go to another

1 agency or anything of that nature. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Officer , let me 
3 ask you a question. When an officer in your 
4 training, an officer, once the officer makes a 
5 determination that he is going to place the suspect 
6 under arrest, is he taught to use whatever means is 
7 necessary to affect that arrest given whatever 
8 circumstances he may be presented with. 
A Yes, ma'am. 9 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So, for example, if you 
11 have a fleeing suspect. 
A Yes, ma'am. 12 
13 Q Is there any training based on either 
14 police academy training or training under a field 
15 officer, field training officer where you would give 
16 that suspect commands to stop and desist, get down, 
17 freeze, you know, phrases like that. And then if 
18 the suspect does not, would that, do you have any 
19 training on do you then pursue that suspect or do 
20 you just let them run away? 
21 A You have to look at the totality of the 
22 circumstances of that particular incident. 
23 You have to weigh the safety of the 
24 community, the safety of the officer. For example, 
25 in a vehicle, if their crime doesn't outweigh them

1 running and taking off in the vehicle and us 
2 pursuing them and we hit an innocent victim and 
3 they're killed, does their crime outweigh that? No, 
4 we don't. If the danger that they could cause the 
5 community is greater, then yes, you will pursue. 
6 Q So someone who is speeding and won't pull 
7 over, you're not going to engage them in a high 
8 speed pursuit? 
A No, ma'am. 9 
10 Q But the suspect that you are attempting to 
11 pull over, if he has a warrant for murder in the 
12 first degree, a violent offense such as an assault 
13 or a sexual crime, you might under the circumstances 
14 make a determination to pursue that suspect? 
A Yes, ma'am. 15 
16 Q So it is all dependent upon the 
17 circumstances, correct? 
A Correct. 18 
19 Q And officers are trained and taught that 
20 they have to very quickly assess the circumstances 
21 and use their best discretion and their decision 
22 making on whether you pursue that suspect, allow 
23 that suspect to get away. And what means you need 
24 to take in order to affect an arrest if you 
25 determine to pursue the suspect?

4 situation, like was he overly, you know, some people 
5 are over thinkers, they want to really sit back and 
6 decide, to have time to examine all possibilities 
7 and some people react too quickly without really 
8 giving thought to what they're doing. Were you ever 
9 concerned that Darren Wilson was either over 
10 thinking and might not react appropriately in time 
11 or that he was too quick to react without thinking 
12 things through? 
13 A I thought his judgment, he always made 
14 sound judgments on his decisions. Of course, we 
15 always go back and look how could we have done it 
16 better the next time. At the time when he is 
17 handling things, he always had good judgment.

22 where someone has jumped off a high concrete wall on 
23 the entrance ramp to a highway, I'm not going to put 
24 myself in danger to do that for a jaywalking.

1 well, I mean, I see people here, people on their 
2 balcony, people here, maybe I shouldn't shoot in 
3 this situation? 
4 A I don't know where we got to the shooting 
5 part on this. You said simply jaywalking. You said 
6 fled on foot. 
7 Fled on foot. 
8 A What actions? 
9 You had a confrontation and 
10 he runs away on foot? 
11 A I can't play the what if thing game, it 
12 has to be the totality of the circumstances. 
13 I'm getting to the part 
14 where you have the suspect and you notice that their 
15 are traffic, cars, you know this is residential area 
16 and there is people on balconies, people could be 
17 walking their dog, and people taking their trash 
18 out. And this person is unarmed, would you decide 
19 maybe this is not the best way to pull my gun out or 
20 somebody else could get hurt? 
21 Does he know the person is 
22 unarmed? 
23 A I can't answer your question not with what 
24 you're saying. 
25 Maybe I can rephrase it a

1 little bit. Did you ever teach officer Darren 
2 Wilson when to or when not to open fire in a 
3 residential, to have a different response? 
4 A When you decide to use deadly force, it is 
5 the threat that you perceive at the time. If it is 
6 in a residential area, at times you will have to 
7 fire in a residential area. 
8 Okay. 
9 A Again, these are vague, you are asking 
10 vague when you have a situation. You are asking me 
11 to make a determination on something that you can't 
12 do, you have the totality of the circumstances. 
13 Okay. 
14 A Just for jaywalking, would I pull a gun? 
15 No. If I stop somebody for jaywalking and it turns 
16 into a physical altercation, it is not a jaywalking 
17 any more. We've gotten beyond that. 
18 The thing also you have to look at 
19 is, what I perceive that I stop somebody for may not 
20 be what that suspect perceives. 
21 I know when an officer stopped 
22 somebody for a simple speeding, little did he know 
23 that guy had just committed an armed robbery at a 
24 7-Eleven. So the officer think's he's just going to 
25 a speeding enforcement, but the suspect in his mind

1 thought he was being stopped for the robbery. So 
2 that decides the suspects, but for a simple 
3 jaywalking, no, you don't pull your weapon. But 
4 when the assault occurred, we are not talking about 
5 jaywalking, jaywalking is irrelevant at that point. 
6 And we both, two people have 
7 used that speeding example. So if you try to pull 
8 somebody over who is speeding and they refuse to 
9 stop, would you take, what would happen, would you 
10 just let them go or would you try another means to 
11 have them pull over? Not necessarily going on a 
12 high speed chase, but would you like try to get in 
13 front of them or call somebody else to try to help 
14 you or would you just let them go? 
15 A You use your radio, you put radio traffic 
16 out there. You never would put your vehicle in 
17 front of another vehicle for speeding. 
18 Okay. 
19 A Your decision to pursue that person for 
20 speeding, a lot of times to continue to drive in 
21 traffic, you back off, get a license plate or 
22 something to go and follow-up on. But you use your 
23 other agencies, if you have a helicopter above, 
24 things of that nature. 
25 When you got to determine

1 whether or not you want to go on a high speed chase, 
2 that doesn't mean you are going to let that person 
3 get away with it? 
4 A I will not go on a high speed chase just 
5 for speeding, I will tell you that. 
6 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I have a question, 
7 Officer We know a little bit about your 
8 walkie-talkie and the mobile radios in cars, and 
9 does your walkie-talkie have an alert button? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ours do with our agency, yes. 
And did your walkie-talkie have an alert 
12 button when you were training Officer Wilson? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And is there any instruction or what do 
15 you train your officers to do as far as when it is 
16 appropriate to use that alert button or not 
17 appropriate, or is it just the officer's discretion 
18 or what? 
A The alert tone on your radio is used for 19 
20 when you need assistance. If you feel that you need 
21 officers to respond, you need aid, that is when you 
22 use your alert tone. 
23 Q If, for example, you have already used 
24 your radio to call for assistance, you already 
25 verbally said I need an assist car, can you send

1 somebody right to my location or whatever, so let me 
2 ask you. Would you say that the alert tone is more 
3 for something that's a lot more serious than, hey, 
4 send another car to assist me on a stop? 
5 A Alert tone is I need help, get here as 
6 fast as you can. That's when you would use the 
7 alert. 
8 Q 
9 situation? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Maybe life or death or very serious 
I'm under attack. 
And maybe the officer can't get to his 
12 radio to call out on his mike? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A With our radios, they don't get out 
16 everywhere, even the alert tone doesn't get out. 
17 The radio gives confirmation that it did get 
18 received actually, but it doesn't get out. There's 
19 some buildings that I was involved in a situation 
20 where I was being assaulted and my radio I couldn't 
21 get out and transmit and my alert tone would not get 
22 out of the building. 
23 Q You head the alert button and dispatch 
24 does not get that alert tone? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. You know, if the radio frequency

Grand Jury Volume XXII November 11, 2014 
Page 49 
1 that's what it is transmitted on as well. 
2 For a scenario, just a 
3 scenario, if you had already called something in on 
4 your radio, and something escalates, you wouldn't 
5 necessarily, or you would maybe necessarily use your 
6 alert button because you already know, either you 
7 knew or that's a backup way to get here more 
8 quickly. 
9 A You asked me to assist, things are under 
10 control. It gets to where it is volatile, I can't 
11 concentrate on transmitting on my radio, I can hit 
12 my button. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: But you have to have a free 
14 hand to hit the button? 
15 A Correct. 
16 You know what Officer 
17 Wilson's range for proficiency was? 
18 
19 
A No, sir. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Officers that are 
20 commissioned police officer have to qualify on a 
21 regular basis. In other words, they have to show 
22 that they're proficient in firearms? 
23 A 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: On a regular basis? 
Correct.

Page 50 
1 MS. ALIZADEH: How often do you have to 
2 qualify? 
3 A We do it there every six months. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So that means going to a 
5 range, you have to hit the target in a certain area 
6 a certain number of times in order to be able to 
7 continue to be an armed officer? 
8 A Correct. It is pass or fail. 
9 When you say feel, that you 
10 have to hit your alert button and you say you feel 
11 that you are under attack, what's your under attack, 
12 what's your definition of it? 
13 A At the time I've used my alert I'm 
14 physically involved in an altercation with a suspect 
15 or if I'm having several approach me, anywhere where 
16 I feel a threat is, it is imminent for somebody to 
17 get there to help me. 
18 Suspect is running way from 
19 you, and then right in front of you would you still 
20 consider that you are under attack.

Somebody running away from me? 
Yes, sir. 
No.

A 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Go ahead. 
It happened a month after this whole 
7 ordeal, it just happened. My situation I was on a 
8 service call --
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, wait a minute. If 
10 this is still under investigation, I'd rather you 
11 not. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: I would agree, it is 
13 something still pending; is that right? 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Let's not talk about it. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: I would agree with that. I 
16 was thinking something earlier. 
17 
18 
19 
A No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
If a suspect is fleeing from 
20 you, what the other juror said, and you didn't 
21 really feel under attack, that would not keep you 
22 from trying to get him still? 
23 A Oh, not at all. I would still go after 
24 him. 
25 You are still going to

1 pursue him? 
2 A Correct. 
3 And that can be in second's 
4 notice? 
5 A It depends on the attack on myself. 
6 That's where you weigh the circumstances. The 
7 attack on myself is him getting away a danger to the 
8 community 
9 When he's running away you 
10 wouldn't necessarily feel like you're under attack, 
11 so the need for an alert button wouldn't be there at 
12 that time, maybe not? 
13 A I won't say that, no, I'm not saying that. 
14 You wouldn't feel under 
15 attack, running away? 
16 A No. 
17 So I can understand it, when 
18 a suspect after they've had an altercation with you, 
19 okay, for example, and they're running away, you 
20 would still consider them to be a threat possibly to 
21 the community because, or yourself, and I'm just 
22 thinking is it because maybe they could get a weapon 
23 somewhere, maybe they could take someone hostage, 
24 you don't know if they're armed or not or whatever, 
25 is that the mindset to this where you would still

1 pursue them, decide it being your job to pursue and 
2 capture a suspect that's done something, you know, 
3 broken the law or whatever? 
4 A If somebody has assaulted me personally as 
5 a police officer, they can assault anyone out there. 
6 I mean, someone who assaults a police officer or 
7 someone in authority, what would prevent them from 
8 assaulting anyone else. 
9 Suspects know we are trained, know we 
10 have weapons of that nature, you know. If they are 
11 willing to attack us knowing that we have that, what 
12 would prevent them from attacking a citizen who 
13 doesn't have that, those tools. 
14 How have you been taught to 
15 utilize your vehicle's lights and siren 
16 appropriately? I guess, what would cause you to use 
17 those? 
18 A In the State of Missouri state law, if 
19 you're going to violate any traffic laws or anything 
20 be consider an emergency room vehicle, your use of 
21 lights and audible signal, doesn't specify siren, 
22 audible signal must be used. In the State of 
23 Missouri at least one flashing red signal. You use 
24 those when you are responding to calls and on the 
25 severity of the call. Crime in progress or

1 something of that nature and if you want to stop a 
2 traffic violater then you use it, things of that 
3 nature. 
4 You wouldn't use it, for 
5 instance, like you were stopping someone on foot? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Like a pedestrian check. 
8 A You might use it if, you know, you are 
9 stopping somebody on the side of the highway, 
10 walking on the side of the highway, I'm going to 
11 turn my warning lights for warning purposes, but no, 
12 it is not required to stop that person. 
13 Thank you. 
14 If you were blocking traffic 
15 kind of, you would turn just your lights on, but not 
16 the sirens to signify that this is a police matter 
17 or something? 
18 A It depends on the roadway. I've pulled 
19 over onto the shoulder many times without turning 
20 any of my emergency equipment on. In residential 
21 areas, you park on the side of street just like cars 
22 do. 
23 You are not parked, you are 
24 catty-corner, you are in the roadway of the driving 
25 of the other drivers.
