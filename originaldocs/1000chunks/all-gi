1 A Especially hot, the gases that come out of 
2 the barrel, you get a muzzle flame and super heated 
3 gases that come out of the barrel and they can burn 
4 you. 
5 Q When you examine the injury visually on 
6 the hand, do you see any evidence of burning? 
7 A So we have to remember when I did my 
8 autopsy, Dr. had already taken this 
9 relevant area out of the body. He submitted it for 
10 histology, so I had nothing to look at really of the 
11 hand that would suggest to me at that moment in time 
12 that there was close range. 
13 Q So your conclusion about the thermal 
14 changes is based strictly on your examination of the 
15 slides that were provided? 
16 A And Dr. photographs. 
17 Q Okay. And so is there a difference, can 
18 you draw, what conclusion do you draw from the fact 
19 that you see thermal changes in the tissue? 
20 A I would just lump it altogether and say 
21 close range discharge of a firearm. It is within a 
22 very close proximity of the muzzle of the weapon, 
23 enough to get thermal effect as well as soot 
24 deposition.

1 closer, or farther away, like you could possibly 
2 wouldn't see? 
3 A I know what you are trying to say. 
4 Q You give a range for the close contact or 
5 the close range? 
6 A That would cause thermal effect? 
7 Q Yes. 
8 A That is difficult, I cannot do that. I 
9 don't know of any ballpark numbers to say, you know, 
10 it has to be 2 inches before you see thermal affect. 
11 I don't know, but I can tell you it has to be close. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And then you 
13 prepared a report regarding your findings in this 
14 case. I'm going to hand you what I've marked as 
15 State's Exhibit: Number 80. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask a question while 
17 you are looking for that. Doctor, can you say that 
18 how the injury occurred to the hand, I mean, you 
19 could say close range, but you can't say whether or 
20 not someone was grabbing the weapon and moving it or 
21 trying to avoid the weapon from shooting them or any 
22 of that? 
23 A Right, there's nothing based on images and 
24 histology for me to be able to say how the hand was 
25 and what he was intending to do, I have no idea.

1 MS. WHIRLEY: You're not calling it a 
2 contact? 
3 A I'm calling it close range. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Close range. Tell us the 
5 difference, I know it sounds self-explanatory. 
6 A It is kind of what we are discussing. In 
7 order for me to call it literally contact gunshot 
8 wound, the muzzle was on the skin. I would prefer 
9 to see a lot of soot deposition inside the wound. I 
10 like to see some searing of the barrel. I would 
11 like to see a muzzle imprint of the barrel on the 
12 skin. That's what I prefer to see in order to say 
13 contact range. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: You don't see any of that, 
15 so you call it close range? 
16 A Close range. It's a little bit more of a 
17 hedgy term. To say I don't know exactly how far it 
18 was, but it wasn't necessarily right up against the 
19 skin. 
20 A contact 
21 would be somebody taking their life? 
22 A If they take the barrel and put it right 
23 to their temple and pull the trigger, yes, I would 
24 call that a contact range gunshot wound.

4 marked for identification.) 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going ahead to mark 
6 my copy, and this is Grand Jury Exhibit 81, is this 
7 a copy of your autopsy report? 
8 A Yes, ma'am. This is copy of our autopsy 
9 report. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. Since this is my 
11 copy and I've marked it with highlights, but I'm 
12 going to make a clean copy for everyone. I thought 
13 I already did this, but just for the sake of making 
14 sure that we're looking at the same thing. The last

Let me ask you, Dr. , we're going to

22 Dr. , you saw his autopsy report, are there 
23 any differences between your findings and

25 A

?

1 difference is that wound that we described on the 
2 left forearm. He called it blunt force, I called it 
3 sharp force. Whether that's significant, but that's 
4 the only difference. 
5 Q In order for you to perform your autopsy, 
6 did you need to see the vehicle, Michael Brown's 
7 vehicle, I mean, Officer Wilson's vehicle? 
8 A No, ma'am. 
9 Q What about medical records from Officer 
10 Wilson? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
Did you need to see the clothing from 
13 Officer Wilson? 
14 A No. 
15 Q And you said you did not have the clothing 
16 for Michael Brown when you did your autopsy, 
17 correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Would it have been helpful for you to have 
20 the clothing? 
21 A It is always helpful to have the clothing 
22 in gunshot wound cases. That way you can see any 
23 soot or anything, any gunpowder particles on the 
24 clothing, but it doesn't mean I can't perform my job 
25 if I don't have them.

1 Q Was there anything that you needed in 
2 order to do your job and come up with your findings 
3 that you didn't have? 
4 A No. 
5 Q Did you, how did you have the gun to 
6 examine? 
7 A Oh, no. 
8 Q Did you need to have the gun in order to 
9 come up with your findings? 
10 A No, ma'am, I have never had a gun to look 
11 at during an autopsy. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Anything else. 
13 Was this 
14 the time that you examined the body eight days 
15 later. Do you normally examine, is there like an 
16 earliness or being eight days late, do you normally 
17 examine later or sooner? 
18 A So my job is kind of unique. People that 
19 die overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq, it takes them 
20 a number of days to get back to Dover. Sometimes 
21 embarrassing, they it could take a week. So I'm 
22 pretty accustom to seeing bodies if they have been 
23 dead for a number of days.

2 or prepare your report? 
3 A No, ma'am. Yesterday was the first day I 
4 was seeing the crime scene photos. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: That was when you and I 
6 were talking about this? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And would you have 
9 needed those to have performed the autopsy and come 
10 up with your findings? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Not in this case, no. 
The ones I showed you, you recall that we 
13 were looking at the position of the deceased body as 
14 it laid on the ground and the position of his right 
15 hand? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q All right. And was I asking you if you 
18 would expect to see dirt in the wound when his hand 
19 would be positioned in that manner? 
20 A All we can see from that is that the 
21 relevant gunshot surface of his hand was not 
22 touching the ground, that's all I can say about 
23 that. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Anything else anyone?

2 MS. ALIZADEH: It is November 6th at 1:37 
3 p.m. Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, all 
4 12 grand jurors are present and , the court 
5 reporter, is present and taking down what's 
6 happening in the grand jury. We have one more 
7 witness for today and his name is 
I'm not sure if it is And I 8 
9 believe it is he will spell it 
10 when he gets here. 
11 And so prior to his testimony, we're going 
12 to play a disc that I've marked.

14 marked for identification.) 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
16 82. Just for explanation purposes. This is a disc 
17 of a POD cast. Do you all know what a POD cast is? 
18 If you were on the internet, you can broadcast 
19 yourself as well as images and voice, okay. 
20 There is a man, I don't know where he 
21 originates from, but his name I'm 
22 not sure how you say it. But he has a POD cast and 
23 so you will see from the video, you can see him and 
24 he's sitting in a desk. It looks like he's sitting 
25 at a console and he's got what looks like a radio

1 microphone, but he talks about all kind of things. 
2 This is a regular thing for him, this is 
3 what he does. And then he also take his calls, 
4 people call in like a radio show, they will talk 
5 about whatever the topic is. 
6 And then those programs get broadcast out 
7 on the internet. Go to whatever his website is to 
8 watch his show and so this is a recording of a part 
9 of his show, where the caller talks about having 
10 witnessed the shooting of Michael Brown. 
11 And so we're going to go ahead and play 
12 the call first. This is again Grand Jury Exhibit 
13 Number 82. Actually on this disc there are two 
14 files. And I'm playing the file that is entitled To 
15 Police Brutality! What Should Citizens Do. 
16 The other file is actually the beginning 
17 of the show before the caller calls in and it is 
18 just the host of the show talking about things, so 
19 it is not something that eyewitness account. 
20 Let me pause it because, , we do not 
21 have a transcript. As best you can if you could 
22 transcribe what we're hearing. I will have you go 
23 ahead and pause the recording right now.

2 not have any sympathy for the situation. You go 
3 look on my channel and see the guy that I have and

10 how they are reporting themselves. 
11 I'm the only one who did it. So it is 
12 funny that the coon doesn't allow people to get on

4 that's the name of street Canfield Road. And

11 I guess he was turned

14 his knees, he just collapsed in the middle of the 
15 road.

17 reports, since you saw it firsthand, this is good, 
18 there are some reports which you are saying openly 
19 and hopefully you can help us out with that. There 
20 are some reports saying that the guy had his hands

12 heard the first shot, the first shot came from the

14 That's what the officer 
15 wrote. I was calling bullshit, the officer was 
16 claiming that the dude was trying to grab his gun
