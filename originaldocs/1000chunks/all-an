1 Q And so when you began working for the 
2 County Medical Examiner's Office, was there any 
3 training that you underwent or any on-the-job 
4 training that you had to go through when you first 
5 began? 
6 A Urn, I mean, the main thing that's 
7 important is that you've done a certified or 
8 approved forensic fellow, which I did do at St. 
9 Louis University through their system at the St. 
10 Louis City Medical Examiner's Office. So that's the 
11 main thing that you do need, plus your medical 
12 degree and eventually being board certified to be 
13 able to practice what I practice at. 
14 Q And so in probably, what I would say in 
15 layman's terms, one of your chief duties and 
16 responsibilities is to perform autopsies, correct? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And just we all think we know what an 
19 autopsy is, but can you explain for the jurors in 
20 general when you have a deceased person how you 
21 begin an autopsy? 
22 A The autopsy itself, it is kind of layman's 
23 terms just for the general examination that occurs 
24 that I have for a case and it entails a lot of 
25 features depending on the circumstances, some things

1 are not done or done, but in a complete sense of an 
2 autopsy, you do an external examination, which is 
3 looking at the external features of the body with 
4 the clothes on and then removed. 
5 Once they are removed, you want to 
6 look at any type of identifying characteristic, any 
7 kind of scar, any type of wounds, any type of 
8 tattoos, anything that you can physically see on the 
9 body that may be an abnormality or be something 
10 different, that's the external portion of the 
11 examination. 
12 That is then ultimately followed with 
13 an internal examination where you are actually 
14 assessing all of the organs, weighing the organs 
15 looking at the organs to see if you see any type of 
16 pathological or disease type changes, any type of 
17 injuries on the inside of the body. 
18 In terms of different ancillary 
19 studies that would be things that are in addition to 
20 external, as well as the internal examination we do 
21 toxicology, that's taking fluids from the body just 
22 in a general sense, blood, urine, fluid from the 
23 (listen) eyes where that fluid is tested to see if 
24 there is any type of drugs, any type of toxins 
25 within the body.

1 The body is x-rayed some time to look 
2 for any type of fracture, in homicide to see if 
3 there is any type of projectiles within the body or 
4 any type of knives or things of that nature. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
And by projectile, you mean like a bullet? 
Correct, like a bullet. Other things that 
7 are done, sometimes I do cultures, that is just 
8 looking for any type of bacteria or viral packaging 
9 that may be in the body, that may be the cause of 
10 death. Medical records, if they are present, I will 
11 review those as well and sometimes I have to use 
12 histology, which is looking at actual tissue that 
13 has been processed to be able to look under a 
14 microscope, where I look under the microscope and 
15 then I can make a diagnosis of different type of 
16 disease changes. 
17 So those are kind of the basic things 
18 that go into an autopsy and as I said, sometimes all 
19 of those things are used, and sometimes bits and 
20 pieces are used, but more the most part complete 
21 external examination, internal examination and the 
22 toxicology, that's pretty much routine on all cases. 
23 Q And now you are not the toxicologist; is 
24 that correct?

1 Q In a situation where there might be

3 is there always a police officer who is present for 
4 the autopsy? 
5 
6 
A

And are those generally, well not

Q 
Yes, they do. 
And are you present when a police officer 
14 is photographing the autopsy?

16

Do you at times direct the officer, you

18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
And then if you are removing anything 
20 foreign from the body, do you then, does the officer 
21 document that object? 
22 
23

Q 
Yes, he does. 
Does typically the officer would then

Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. Now, in this particular case, this 
10 autopsy performed on Michael Brown, what information 
11 did you have from that was something 
12 that you considered prior to beginning the autopsy? 
13 A Urn, when I was contacted by 
14 he called me on my personal cell phone to let me 
15 know what particular cases came in on his shift and 
16 he informed me of the cases that came on his shift, 
17 and one of the cases was Mr. Michael Brown. 
18 The circumstances that I got from him 
19 were very brief and minimal. At that particular 
20 time he informed me that there was a police 
21 shooting. He mentioned to me that there appears to 
22 have been a struggle and that was kind of the extent 
23 of the information that I had at that particular 
24 time. 
25 So from that point, I know that the

1 body is going to have to come in for examination due 
2 to the nature of the particular type of event. 
3 There is certain cases that are under 
4 my jurisdiction as a medical examiner and that 
5 particular case of Mr. Michael Brown fit that 
6 jurisdiction, so I knew that that case was going to 
7 come in for examination. 
8 Q Are you aware that Missouri has a statute 
9 that says that the actual body and its possessions 
10 of a deceased person are the property of the Medical 
11 Examiner's Office? 
A Yes, I am. 12 
13 Q And so in this particular case, well, let 
14 me back up. 
15 You're aware that 
16 ultimately prepared a report, correct? 
A Yes. 17 
18 Q But he didn't have his report prepared 
19 when you first began your examination; is that 
20 correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And did you see any other police 
23 reports or any other reports about this incident 
24 before you began your examination?

1 Q Did you get any other information from 
2 anywhere else, whether it be a police officer or 
3 witnesses or anybody else? 
4 A Before I started my examination, Detective 
5 was present at my autopsy 
6 examination and I did ask him about the 
7 circumstances that he knew at that particular time. 
8 Q What did he tell you about what he knew at 
9 that time? 
10 A Trying to remember exactly, it is a while 
11 back, but it was just basically similar situation of 
12 there were two gentlemen in the street, police 
13 officer responded to that particular area, from that 
14 point in time a struggle ensued and then after that 
15 things were difficult to determine at that point in 
16 time, but ultimately it ended in the result of

21

Yes, I do. 
And is that report reviewed by anyone else

9 And when we talk about these, now we 
10 have already had some testimony from some crime 
11 scene detectives about these photographs, and 
12 including the fact that each photograph has a number 
13 on the back of it. And so when I refer to the 
14 photographs, since I haven't marked these 
15 individually, we will just say this is Image Number 
16 1, okay?

And so forth. 
Okay. 
So let me turn down the lights again.

22 So, Dr. I know you're not 
23 necessarily the author of this and not familiar with 
24 what is depicted in Image Number 1, but the jurors 
25 have heard testimony about this. This is the

1 placard that was prepared by the officer who took 
2 these photographs and that would be his DSN down at 
3 the bottom And my knowledge is that that is 
4 Detective And if necessary he can 
5 testify about taking these photographs if you need 
6 to hear from him about what he's done. 
7 But, of course, it is going to have 
8 to be the doctor who testifies about what we are 
9 seeing in these photographs for the most part. So 
10 Image Number 1 is the placard. 
11 Can you put Image Number 2 up there, 
12 please? I think it goes towards you on the thing, 
13 there you go. Can you describe what you are seeing 
14 in that image? 
15 A On the table is Mr. Michael Brown, the 
16 decedent in question, and this is the way that the 
17 body was presented to me after removal of the body 
18 bag, which is the white bag that you see draped over 
19 the table. And there's the placard identifying the 
20 particular case and that's myself off into the 
21 background in the back. 
22 Q So that placard, and here is a laser 
23 pointer right next to you right there, can you just 
24 point to where the placard is you are talking about? 
25 A This is the placard, identifying placard

1 for this particular case. 
2 Q And that's prepared, that's not the one 
3 that the county detectives prepared, that's 
4 something that the medical examiner does, correct?

7 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
Okay. 
Actually, sorry, this one is St. Louis 
8 County, sorry.

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
So when the body 
11 leaves the scene, is it taken directly to your 
12 offices or where is the examining on the lOth, what 
13 happens between when it is collected and this day? 
14 A The body is picked up from a delivery 
15 service, delivery service is responsible for picking 
16 the body up from the scene. At that point when the 
17 body is picked up from the scene, it is brought 
18 directly to the St. Louis County Medical Examiner 
19 and it is placed in the morgue, in a cooler, until 
20 eventually I'm going to come for the examination. 
21 Let me back up a step. When the body 
22 comes in and it is checked in by the morgue staff or 
23 it is given a number, and just to make sure that it 
24 is logged in appropriately and put into the morgue, 
25 but the body goes into the cooler to wait until the

3 now. 
4 Thank you.

A 
Q 
You are welcome. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So when the body was 
7 removed from the cooler, was it still locked in the 
8 bag? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
We heard talk about the fact that 
11 there is a lock placed on the bag at the scene by 
12 him? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
After the body is received at the Medical 
15 Examiner's Office, does anyone before your autopsy 
16 begins unlock that bag? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
No. 
If that lock had been disturbed or broken 
19 or opened when you began your autopsy, would you 
20 have noted that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so when you open the body bag, this is 
23 the body of Michael Brown as it appeared when you 
24 open the body bag? 
25 A That is correct.

Q We see in the image that we have heard 
testimony from that there is paper

7 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And that was done by at the scene? 
That is correct. 
And would it be protocol for to 
8 have used latex gloves while he is handling any of 
9 the body while he is at the scene? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
So after that has happened and the officer 
12 has photographed what we see in Image Number 2, what 
13 happens next? 
14 A Urn, at this point, in theory and in terms 
15 of normal protocol or in terms of how I approach the 
16 case, at this point I will eventually myself start 
17 looking at the body, start the initial external 
18 examination that I spoke with you all at the 
19 beginning where I am looking at the clothing that 
20 the particular decedent has on. And just stating 
21 how the body appears to me, at least initially, in 
22 terms of clothing and that would be the next step. 
23 Q Okay. And so let's move through the 
24 photographs as we go and Image Number 3? 
25 A Yes, this is Image Number 3.

1 Q So just describe, if you briefly want to 
2 describe what we are seeing here? 
3 A This is just the decedent, Mr. Michael 
4 Brown, from the other side of his body, looking from 
5 the other angle before the angle is just flip 
6 flopped. So it is just the other side, you are 
7 looking at the right side of his body as opposed to 
8 the first image which was the left side of his body. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. Image Number 4? 
Image Number 4 is just kind of an overall 
11 view of Mr. Michael Brown's face as he is as soon as 
12 the bag is removed to expose his face and rest of 
13 his upper body. 
14 Q And this up here, that's the placard that 
15 you were talking about? 
16 A That's the identifying placard that was 
17 prepared by St. Louis County Police Department, this 
18 is Mr. Michael Brown's face. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. And Image Number 5? 
Image Number 5. So this is, we actually 
21 have a ladder in the actual morgue suite where you 
22 are able to get a higher vantage point to be able to 
23 get a larger view of the body. 
24 So the officer in this particular 
25 case has got on top of the ladder, he is doing an

1 overall of Mr. Michael Brown where you can see at 
2 least down to the mid thigh, from the head down to 
3 the mid thigh and seeing the arms and the torso, and 
4 here is the identifying placard again. 
5 Q Let me stop you here. As you say the body 
6 was, you know, the bag was opened and you examined 
7 it, are the clothes disturbed for the purposes of 
8 these photograph? 
9 A No, the clothes were not disturbed. This 
10 is how they are maintained within the bag as soon as 
11 it is opened. 
12 Q So nobody lifted up the shirt, nobody 
13 pulled the pants down, that's how it was when you 
14 first saw it? 
A Correct. 15 
16 Q Okay. At this point, are you the one who 
17 puts the body onto the table? 
18 A Urn, so from here, he was placed on this 
19 table initially within the morgue cooler, it is on 
20 wheels. So when it comes out, he is staying on here 
21 the entire time. So the entire autopsy is going to 
22 start coming from the cooler, to this part where you 
23 are seeing the pictures, to me actually doing my 
24 incisions and remove organs, so he stays on this 
25 table the entire time.

Image Number 6. So this is still a view 
3 from the ladder where the officer is taking 
4 pictures, here is that identifying placard and here 
5 is a shot from the head would be here, the feet are 
6 down here and you can see the hands and you can see 
7 the rest of the lower extremities of Mr. Michael 
8 Brown and what he was wearing. 
9 Q Now, there is a white object that's 
10 affixed to his right ankle, do you know what that 
11 is? 
12 A These are added to the body just as 
13 identifiers to make sure we know whose who when they 
14 are coming in for examination.
