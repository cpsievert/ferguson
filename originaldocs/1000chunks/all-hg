4 A I don't believe so, no. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody want to see 
6 any portion of those again? 
7 I just have a question. If 
8 the video of , the video from her 
9 view was on the ground, I can't remember, did you 
10 take any from her apartment? 
11 A was originally in a car, 
12 she had pulled up to. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Here you go. 
14 She was never in an 
15 apartment? 
16 A No, ma'am. 
17 You were just doing her from 
18 her view. She was there to 
19 A Yes. She originally pulled up in the 
20 parking spot and pulled right here, exit her vehicle 
21 and we had one so that's why you see originally 
22 stationary shot but then the detective begins to 
23 move and he's moving in the general direction he was 
24 moving in.

1 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now during your 
2 investigation, in the early days, now this all 
3 happened on the same day of the shooing; is that 
4 right? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And at this point in your investigation, 
7 the FBI, the federal authorities were not involved 
8 in the investigation; is that right? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
But within a day or two you learned that 
11 the FBI was going to either assist or co-investigate 
12 with the County? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q Was there some confusion between St. Louis 
15 County and the federal authorities what role they 
16 were taking or whether they were assisting you were 
17 you going to share information, and so forth? 
18 A It took a little bit to coordinate the 
19 logistics of how the investigation would be run 
20 parallel to one another, yes. 
21 Q And so the Saturday after the shooting, so 
22 one week from the time of the shooting there was 
23 talk or decision about the detectives going to the 
24 Canfield Apartment Complex and doing a canvas? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
We discussed that, yes.

Q

Page 210 
What's a canvas? 
Essentially going to a given area and 
3 knocking on doors or meeting people walking through 
4 the area and asking them if they had witnessed 
5 anything that had taken place at a given time. 
6 So, for example, in this particular 
7 investigation, it would have been for August 9th, 
8 the previous Saturday. 
9 Q Okay. Now, had the County done some 
10 canvassing on the day of the shooting? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, it had, yes. 
You had not canvassed the entire complex? 
We canvassed a majority of the buildings 
14 that would of had a direct line of sight to where 
15 the incident took place. Either being where the 
16 police vehicle stopped, or where we could say what 
17 would be the furthest point to the east right around 
18 here. Any building with a direct line of sight we 
19 would have made attempts to canvas.

1 work during the shooting, I didn't see anything, you 
2 note that, correct? 
3 A We note that as well, yes. 
4 Q If somebody says, yeah, I heard gunshots 
5 but I didn't see anything, you would note that? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And if there was somebody who says I saw 
8 what happened and I saw parts of it, then you would 
9 interview that person, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when you say you, you had other 
12 detectives doing that on this day; is that correct? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q And in the days to follow, did you learn 
15 that there were other witnesses that maybe weren't 
16 home during the canvas, were you leaving cards at 
17 houses where there was nobody home? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
We were not, no. 
But as the days progressed you learned 
20 that there were people that were there, claimed to 
21 have been there but you didn't talk to that day for 
22 one reason or another, correct? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And, in fact, did you learn early on in 
25 the investigation that there was a person, a young

10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
He did not. 
Had he ever seen him before? 
He had not. 
And during your interview with Darren 
11 Wilson, did you, well, strike that. Did you later 
12 during the early days of your investigation, are 
13 there officers that were monitoring the news, and 
14 websites, Facebook pages and so forth just trying to 
15 see if there were other witnesses to this? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And did you learn the identity of the 
18 young man that was with Michael Brown? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
We did. 
And when did you learn who it was? 
Late evening hours of August 9th, we saw 
22 a, when I say we, a detective that I worked with, 
23 saw a video of Dorian Johnson being interviewed by 
24 one of the local media outlets.

3 A Correct. 
4 Q Did you then make attempts to try to 
5 contact Dorian Johnson? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q This was when the last Dorian Johnson? 
8 A I'd have to check my notes for sure, but I 
9 would say it was roughly, I don't know, I'd have to 
10 check my notes.

Q 
We made multiple attempts, yes. 
Did you talk to any family members of his?

16 that community that you were looking to talk to him?

Now, we've seen some video of interviews

Q 
He could have been, yes. 
He had shot and killed somebody, correct?

Wouldn't you normally interview a suspect 
12 in a homicide investigation? 
13 A Just for clarification, you say Darren 
14 Wilson, I'm sorry, you said Darren Johnson, we are 
15 talking about Darren Wilson; is that right? 
16 Q How many times have I done that, I've 
17 called you and I've called Darren

25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And so you hadn't arrested him at

1 this point; is that right? 
A That's correct. 2 
3 Q So your investigation was about what, at 
4 this point you knew that Darren Wilson had shot and 
5 killed Michael Brown; is that correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q Did you feel that you had probable cause 
8 at that time to arrest Darren Wilson? 
A No. 9 
10 Q And so what further information did you 
11 need to make that determination? 
12 A Well, obviously, the purpose of the 
13 interview would be to gather Darren Wilson's 
14 statement of what took place that day. 
15 Q Okay. But Darren Wilson had already been 
16 interviewed by 
17 A That interview is considered a, 
18 essentially a public safety statement where we are 
19 obtaining brief information to gather the most basic 
20 facts of the incident to insure we're not looking 
21 for suspects, victims, to make sure that we don't 
22 have any errant rounds into any buildings, things of 
23 that nature.

1 interview, was more of a safety statement or safety 
2 interview, I should say. 
3 Q All right. So we heard the term cursory 
4 interview used, would you consider 
5 interview on that to be more cursory interview? 
6 A That's an appropriate terminology, yes. 
7 Q So now what was the purpose of your 
8 interview then? 
9 A My interview would have been to gather a 
10 detailed statement from Officer Darren Wilson and 
11 then obviously to have that statement recorded. 
12 Q And have you ever been involved in 
13 investigations of officer involved shootings? 
14 A I have, yes. 
15 Q Have you ever been involved in 
16 investigations of excessive force used that maybe 
17 didn't involve shooting? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
I have. 
And did you treat this investigation any 
20 differently than you would have or have in the past 
21 treated any other officer involved shooting 
22 investigation? 
23 A No. 
24 Q So after you, so when you spoke with 
25 Darren Wilson, he had an attorney present, is that

1 unusual when an officer is involved in a shooting? 
2 A There are instances where officers request 
3 to have an attorney and there are instances where 
4 they do not request to have an attorney, and that is 
5 purely up to the officer. 
6 Q All right. So you've seen it both ways? 
7 A I've seen it both ways, yes. 
8 Q Of course, if Darren Wilson wanted to 
9 refuse to be interviewed, he could do that, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
He could. 
And you couldn't compel him to give a 
12 statement, could you? 
13 A I cannot. 
14 Q So after the interview with Darren Wilson, 
15 did you place him under arrest? 
16 A I did not. 
17 Q Why not? 
18 A I did not believe there was probable cause 
19 to arrest him.

3 Q And you're aware that there are other 
4 witnesses out there that we are trying to locate in

8 Q You are still working on this case; is 
9 that right? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Urn, and so after speaking with detective, 
12 or I'm sorry, with Officer Wilson, you allowed him 
13 to leave with his attorney? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q And as the days and weeks continued on 
16 with this investigation, have you always been the 
17 primary on this investigation?

I have. 
And can you give, now, let's go back. Now 
20 we are talking about the FBI getting involved. Some 
21 days after in the first week of the shooting?

23 
A Okay.

1 that civilian had been arrested considering there 
2 was a deceased on the ground? 
3 A Well, the circumstances between a civilian 
4 and a police officer are somewhat different. So I 
5 don't know that without the specifics, all the 
6 specific facts of an incident like that I could give 
7 you a fair answer. 
8 I will tell you that I have conducted 
9 investigations in the past on civilian shootings, 
10 other civilians and it has been deemed justified. 
11 Is that what you are kind of asking? 
12 Well, yes and no, but a 
13 shooting, just a shooting, you caught the person who 
14 shot, so that person is arrested. The shooter 
15 didn't flee and there's a deceased on the ground, 
16 would that person have been arrested right then and 
17 there. 
18 A I think without being in a particular 
19 situation like that, I don't think I could answer 
20 that question. There is too many variables that go 
21 into something like that. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: So let me see if I can 
23 clarify. 
24 Officer's allowed to use force and even 
25 deadly force to affect an arrest in Missouri, you

1 are aware of that, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am, I am. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 224 
2 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) It all depends on the 
4 circumstances, correct? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then you're also aware that 
7 individuals, whether they be police officers or even 
8 private citizens are allowed to use force to defend 
9 themselves? 
A I am aware of that. 10 
11 Q Even deadly force under certain 
12 circumstances? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 Q I'm going to give you a what if scenario. 
15 If a woman is at home by herself and asleep in her 
16 bed and somebody unknown to her breaks into her 
17 house and attacks her and she obtains a weapon and 
18 shoots him dead. She calls the police and the 
19 police arrive. And if you had this basic 
20 information that this person had broken into the 
21 house. This woman didn't know him, she's in her 
22 night clothes, it is 2:00 in the morning and he's 
23 dead on the ground, would you have arrested that 
24 person for a homicide at that point? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Probably not, no.

1 Q And so you're determination on whether or 
2 not to arrest somebody you feel that you need more 
3 facts, or in this case at least as of the lOth of 
4 August, did you feel you needed more facts before 
5 you made a determination on whether he should be 
6 arrested? 
7 A I feel that it is critically important in 
8 any case, including this case, to gather as many 
9 facts as I can before any kind of determination be 
10 made in terms of arrest, yes. 
11 Q Now, and for purposes of educating the 
12 grand jurors, you might know some of this from your 
13 prior experiences with other cases on the grand 
14 jury, when a police officer arrests a suspect and 
15 places him in custody, he has the option of 
16 releasing him pending a warrant application, 
17 correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And he also has the option of holding him 
20 in custody and making a warrant application within 
21 24 hours of him being placed in custody, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's also correct, yes. 
Okay. And so you chose not to do either 
24 of those, you just let Darren Wilson walk out of the 
25 police department?

That was your decision to allow him to 
That was my decision, yes. 
Did you feel that he was a threat to the 
No. 
Did you believe that he was a flight risk 
12 at that time? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Did his attorneys give you assurances that 
15 they would produce him if need be at a later date, 
16 whether it be for further questioning or in the 
17 event that charges were issued, he would surrender 
18 him to you? 
A They did, yes. 19 
20 Q And so flight risk, danger to the 
21 community, are those some of the considerations that 
22 you have when you determine whether you should 
23 arrest somebody and hold them in custody and make a 
24 warrant application? 
25 A

You didn't think he was a danger to the 
7 community, correct?

9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, on that date, and certainly on the 
10 days to follow, you became very aware, didn't you, 
11 Detective that the public was very intent, 
12 not the public, but there were people in the public 
13 eye and people that were making their voices known 
14 that they wanted to have Officer Wilson arrested and 
15 charged with an offense; is that right?

been 
A I was aware of that, yes. 
Q So that didn't happen? 
A Correct. 
Q And why not. Why has Officer Wilson 
arrested or charged with an offense? 
A Again, I don't feel that there was 
22 probable cause for an arrest. 
never 
23 Q At some point prior, now, the grand jury 
24 first heard evidence on this matter on August 20th. 
25 This happened on August 9th. So are you aware, and

1 you and I talked from like maybe day one about the 
2 investigation; is that correct? 
3 A That's correct. 
4 Q I was the attorney on-call when this 
5 happened? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And so at some point was there a decision 
8 made between my office and County Police that there 
9 would be a grand jury investigation into this 
10 matter? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
There was. 
Okay. And so at that point is there a 
13 decision made that the evidence presented to the 
14 grand jury, it will be their decision on whether or 
15 not charges should be brought against Officer 
16 Wilson? 
17 A At that time, yes. 
18 Q And if this grand jury determines that 
19 Officer Wilson should be charged with an offense and 
20 if they sign an indictment in this case, will you 
21 arrest Darren Wilson for the offense? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
I will. 
And would you cooperate with my office in 
24 the prosecution of Darren Wilson if charges are 
25 brought?

or 
9 So Detective , the first week of the 
10 investigation we knew that the FBI was getting 
11 involved, correct? 
12 A That's correct. 
13 Q And initially you said that there was some 
14 confusion about what role they were taking if they 
15 were there to assist the county or if they were 
16 going to conduct their own investigation, whether or 
17 not information was going to be shared, whether or 
18 not investigations were going to be coordinated. 
19 And there was talk the following Saturday that there 
20 was going be a canvas of the entire apartment 
21 complex, correct? 
22 A That's correct. 
23 Q And as of Friday, the plan was that the 
24 FBI and County Police together were going to canvas 
25 the apartment complex?

That's correct. 
Okay. And at some point on Friday evening 
3 was there, were you advised that there was a 
4 decision made that the County would not be involved 
5 in that canvas of the apartments? 
6 A I was. 
7 Q Okay. So St. Louis County did not play a 
8 role in the canvas that took place on the 16th of 
9 August involving numerous FBI agents? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
When the FBI would identify people who 
12 claim to have witness some part of this, would they 
13 share that information with you? 
14 A They would. 
15 Q And when they would interview people, now, 
16 on the day of the canvas, they interviewed a lot of 
17 people actually in their apartments; is that right?
