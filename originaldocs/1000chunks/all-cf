14 both, or whatever was your main concern holding you 
15 from coming forward? 
16 A No, this stuff is, just the stuff that was 
17 going on every day how your mind back and forth. 
18 Hopefully. 
19 But you were concerned 
20 because your story may have been different than 
21 somebody else's and you were afraid that they may 
22 have been judgmental towards you?

24 
25 
A Right, judgments, yeah, yeah.

10 Too much going on? 
11 A Yeah. I mean, we talked about it, you

3 first gunshot, and can you explain again the second 
4 shot you heard fired was when, what was happening 
5 when that second shot was fired? 
6 A Oh, okay. When the first shot happened, I 
7 told to roll back, open the doors, you know, 
8 kind of take for cover, you know, for a thought. So 
9 we basically stopped, so Mike Brown came on her 
10 side, you know, scooting off or whatnot. I heard a 
11 second shot from then. I didn't see the officer or 
12 none of that. 
13 I don't know if he was in the car or 
14 he might have open his door slightly and shot, I 
15 don't know because the car is catty-corner. I 
16 couldn't see through the tint. I didn't basically

A He was basically, he was basically past 
door. I don't know if he might have been 
8 back by the wheel or just passing her back end, but 
9 I just wasn't looking at all directly. 
10 I was basically looking like walking 
11 past, heard a second shot, it is kind of ducking. 
12 We didn't know where it went or where it was coming

2 enough to see up under a SUV, you know. 
3 And then when you guys 
4 backed up, be able to back up, how far back did you 
5 back up? 
6 A Yeah, probably like 8 feet by then, 7 
7 feet. 
8 Okay. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, you brought up another 
10 point that I want to ask about. You said you can 
11 see underneath the car, and I know it is an SUV and 
12 sits up higher, but don't you think, if you were 3 
13 or 5 feet. 
14 A See, I'm the passenger, the car is 
15 catty-corner, I can see straight up under there, 
16 right up under there. She couldn't see it from her 
17 side, she couldn't see like there, right at the feet 
18 like I could. I could see, you know, just from 
19 looking right up under the SUV. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: You were looking through 
21 the windshield, front windshield when you could see 
22 underneath the car. 
23 A You couldn't see through the back 
24 windshield, it was tinted.

9 It wasn't until you 
10 backed up that you were about 5 feet from them?

GRAND JURY VOLUME VIII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.)

5 September 30th at 8:32 a.m. Present is myself, 
6 Kathi Alizadeh, and Sheila Whirley of St. Louis 
Page 5 
7 County Prosecutor's Office. All 12 grand jurors are 
8 present as well as the court reporter, who is audio 
9 recording and taking down everything that is being 
10 said this morning. 
11 I want to give a little pep talk to you as 
12 it were. I can only imagine the disruption that 
13 this causes in all of your lives and schedules, and 
14 I hope you know how appreciative that we are that we 
15 have the 12 of you who have agreed, even though 
16 maybe your arms were twisted a little bit, but 
17 agreed to, you know, devote the time and effort that 
18 this matter takes. 
19 Don't think I'm understating it or 
20 overstating it to say how important this is. And I 
21 know you all, you know, since you're not a jury, 
22 there is no admonition that you not watch the news 
23 and anything like that, and I know that you can't 
24 really avoid seeing things about this in the news 
25 and, you know, not only here locally, but as well

1 throughout the country. This is a very public 
2 matter and it is very important that we get this 
3 right. 
4 And, as you know, Mr. McCulloch made a 
5 statement in the very beginning we were going to be 
6 as thorough as possible. And that means anybody who 
7 says that they saw part of this or knows something 
8 about it, is going to be able to be heard. 
9 Even people that are reluctant to come in, 
10 we're going to do whatever we can to get them here 
11 because it is important that you have all the facts 
12 and information. 
13 And I know sometimes it seems like it is 
14 very tedious because some of these eyewitnesses have 
15 made multiple statements and again, Mr. McCulloch 
16 has promised that there wasn't going to be anything 
17 that you didn't have the opportunity or weren't able 
18 to see or hear, and that means playing all of these 
19 statements for you. 
20 And we do that because, obviously, there 
21 is times when if a witness makes multiple 
22 statements, sometimes over time their statements 
23 changes, sometimes dramatically, sometimes only 
24 slightly and insignificantly, but I think that those 
25 are things that you all have a right to consider

1 when the witness testifies, if they've made previous 
2 statements that are different than what maybe they 
3 are telling you in the grand jury. 
4 That happens in every case, every time a 
5 witness makes a prior statement, that statement can 
6 be brought up, as you know well, you said this 
7 previously, how come you are changing your story. 
8 And, you know, neither Sheila and I are 
9 prepping these witnesses in the way we would if we 
10 were having a trial. We try cases, we have our 
11 witnesses come in and we talk to them about what is 
12 going to happen, we go over what their testimony is 
13 going to be, not in the sense like rehearsing, we 
14 want to know what they're going to say before they 
15 get up there and testify. 
16 And that's just good lawyering. No one 
17 would ever expect me to put on a witness in a trial 
18 when I didn't know what they were going to say. 
19 But in this case, you know, we don't want 
20 to have to, we don't want to in any way influence 
21 what these people are going to come forward and say 
22 to you. And so we don't do any prepping with any of 
23 these witnesses, other than to explain to them what 
24 is going to happen when they come in here, the

1 when they get here. 
2 I mean, I have an idea because they've 
3 made prior statements, I assume they are going to 
4 say something like they said before, but the reality 
5 is, I don't know, and that's why it is important 
6 that we play for you those prior statements so that 
7 you know what they have said previously and can 
8 compare that to what they say today when they 
9 testify. 
10 A lot of times, I know it is tedious and 
11 it seems redundant, why are we hearing this person 
12 say the same thing now three times. 
13 If the person makes the same statement 
14 three times, you may consider that when you are 
15 deliberating about how that, what that means for 
16 that person's credibility, their ability to have 
17 observed what they say they saw and recall what they 
18 say they saw. Those were all things that I think 
19 are important because there are a lot of people that 
20 see bits and pieces of what happened that day, and I 
21 think you can even see right now how, you know, 
22 depending on where you were standing, it affects 
23 what maybe you say you saw, and that's human nature 
24 too. 
25 So, again, Sheila and I are not worried,

1 but very, we're concerned about the speed that this 
2 is coming in. We're going to do our best to try to 
3 kick it up if we can. 
4 A lot of these eyewitnesses you are going 
5 to hear from who have made multiple statements, we 
6 expect that hopefully that's going to be less and 
7 less and eventually, you know, we'll get through the 
8 eyewitnesses, and then you are going to hear from 
9 ballistics people, and lab people, and DNA people, 
10 and, of course, those witnesses don't have prior 
11 recorded statements that we'll have to present to 
12 you. They may have reports that you will get copies 
13 of, but at any rate, I know that this is tedious. I 
14 know you want your lives back, your lives back the 
15 way they were. 
16 All I can tell you is that this will be 
17 over at some point, this is not indefinite, and 
18 we're doing everything we can to try to get through 
19 this as quickly as possible. 
20 We were hearing the other day that there 
21 is rumors that you all are going to be done this 
22 week. I'm here to tell you, no, that's not 
23 happening. 
24 Originally, we had made estimates we would 
25 get done about the end of October, early November.

2 As I said in the beginning, if this takes 
3 until January for you all to have what you need to 
4 make this decision, then that's what we're going to 
5 have to do. 
6 We'll do it as quickly as we can without 
7 rushing through it and skipping through things that 
8 need to be done. 
9 So that being said, I truly, truly 
10 apologize for the disruption in your lives. You all 
11 really seem to be a great group of people, I'm so 
12 glad you all get along as you do, it would be awful

15 you can, hanging in there with us. 
16 So, again, Sheila and I thank you for your 
17 patience. So that being said, yes. 
18 I have a 
19 question. I try not to watch the news, I try not to 
20 read anything about this because I like to have an 
21 open mind so I have all the facts that is presented 
22 here. 
23 My concern is that, urn, my concern is that 
24 everybody is saying hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, 
25 from what I'm hearing. Hurry up, make a decision,

3 And I know that this information has been 
4 disseminated. I know Mr. McCulloch before has said 
5 there is a process and this is the process that we 
6 have to follow. 
7 Is the NAACP, or these other, you know, 
8 coalitions, are they confirming what he is saying to 
9 the people of Ferguson? I mean, I don't know if you 
10 can comment on that, but. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, all I can tell you 
12 I think everybody needs to 
13 rachet it down a little bit and let us do what we 
14 can do. I have faith and trust in everybody in 
15 here, you know, to make the decision that's 
16 appropriate. I'm not saying it is the right 
17 decision, I'm not saying it is the wrong decision, 
18 but make the decision that's appropriate based on 
19 the facts. But is that being disseminated by these 
20 groups or whatever to the people there? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, there has been, as I 
22 said, there have been rumors, I think there was 
23 someone who had tweeted yesterday, a person of 
24 public, a public person that, you know, I hear 
25 unverified rumor the grand jury is going to have

1 their decision by Friday. I don't know where they 
2 get this stuff. I don't know where that comes from, 
3 but I know that last week and yesterday 
4 Mr. McCulloch did give interviews to the media. 
5 Last week he gave interviews to several 
6 media outlets describing the process. The fact how 
7 a grand jury is selected, you know. 
8 My office has nothing to do with how you 
9 all are selected. The fact that you were selected 
10 way before this even, you know, happened, you know. 
11 And then the process of how, you know, when you have 
12 regular lives, this is not like a jury in a trial 
13 where Monday through Friday from 8:00 to 5:00 you 
14 are going to be here until it is done. That's not 
15 how it works. In a trial that's how it work, I 
16 mean. 
17 We have jurors that we have to tell them 
18 in advance this is going to be a two-week trial, 
19 this is going to be a three-week trial. But he has 
20 made those statements and, you know, I can't, I 
21 can't help what goes around in the rumor mill. I 
22 don't think we have much control over that. 
23 But I will express to him those thoughts 
24 that if any wisdom in trying to bring together some 
25 of the people in the various communities who can

1 disseminate that message that, you know, be patient. 
2 I mean, there is that catch phrase people 
3 always talk about, rush to judgment. That was a 
4 phrase made popular years ago. People keep saying 
5 hurry up, hurry up. We're not going to rush to 
6 judgment here. 
7 If we wanted to, we could present this 
8 case as we do any other case. We could have a 
9 detective come in here and tell you what he thinks, 
10 you know, the evidence is, and then you all would be 
11 making your own decision based on that, but that's 
12 not how we've chosen to do this because of the 
13 importance of letting all sides be heard in this 
14 matter. 
15 So I will talk to Mr. McCulloch about the 
16 strategy behind that, that it might be, because we 
17 all want everybody to just calm down. It will 
18 happen, there will be an answer, but you have to be 
19 patient, you have to let the grand jury do their 
20 job, you have to let us do our job. 
21 And, you know, the problem is too, we 
22 can't tell people how often you're meeting, what 
23 days you're meeting, how many witnesses are 
24 testifying, because we're prohibited from talking 
25 about that.

1 And so when people ask questions how often 
2 are they meeting or how many hours a week or how 
3 many witnesses are they hearing from, we can't 
4 answer those questions. 
5 I think just the fact that the questions 
6 are asked and we can't answer it, I wonder if that 
7 might create even more like, well, why aren't you 
8 telling us this. 
9 So I will talk to him and maybe we'll kick 
10 that around and we meet daily, except for these 
11 days. We usually don't meet on these days, but we 
12 meet pretty much every day and talk about what's 
13 going on and how we are progressing. 
14 And so yes, 
15 I'm going to 
16 piggyback on her question. I've heard a lot of 
17 people talking about, this is people who should 
18 know, talking about why don't they just arrest him, 
19 and then figure out what's going on, why don't they 
20 just take action, do they not understand the 
21 process? Is that the problem, or is there a way to 
22 bypass this because it seems to me that we're doing 
23 what needs to be done and we're doing what's right 
24 and people are not seeing that.

2 and neighbors know what I do and they know I'm doing 
3 this. And trust me, they are asking me questions 
4 all the time. 
5 I hear you. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: All I can say is I don't

9 going to talk about it. I don't want to talk about

11 I don't want to be talking about it and I shouldn't

13 know, we're working hard and so it is just going to 
14 take a while before this process is completed. 
15 And, you know, as far as like you saying 
16 watching the news and everything, I don't watch the 
17 news. I truly don't. I watch the news in the 
18 morning so I can see what the weather is, if there 
19 is like a traffic accident on the highway on my way 
20 in so I need to go a different route. 
21 I don't want to see what's going on, even 
22 though I know it's there and I hear about it, 
23 because, number one, I just need to have a little, 
24 you know, of my personal life that isn't affected by 
25 this, but also I just don't want any of that to

2 I can't worry about what's going on out

4 knows and will tell you, I'm a control freak, and I 
5 think you all know that. 
6 When I can't control something, I don't

MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have a comment? 
Last 
11 night on the news, I know you just said you don't 
12 watch the news, it was stated that Officer Wilson 
13 had a case pending, a previous case pending. My 
14 question is, how much does that affect what we're 
15 going through? 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: It shouldn't affect what 
17 you have. I was aware of that. Simply because I 
18 saw some cameras out yesterday, and I saw an 
19 attorney that was commenting about it and I heard 
20 about what it was. 
21 But, you know, up until August 9th, he was 
22 an on duty police officer who made traffic stops and 
23 arrests and did other things other police officers 
24 do and so I would imagine, I've not looked, but I 
25 would imagine he has pending cases in our office.

1 How those are handled and what comes of 
2 those cases shouldn't be your concern. I will tell 
3 you that I do not believe, and I will look into 
4 this, but I do not believe that he will, I mean, I 
5 know he won't be testifying in front of this grand 
6 jury any more because you're only hearing this 
7 matter. 
8 I don't know that, I can't say for sure he 
9 wouldn't be called to court or called to testify on 
10 anything else, but I think it is unlikely, but I 
11 don't know. I don't know that necessarily will have 
12 any impact on what you all are doing. 
13 That's the best I can say about that. 
14 On for today we have a witness here, his

name is He's going to tell you what 
he knows about this matter and , of 
17 course, has made previous statements so we're going 
18 to start out by listening to those statements. 
19 First statement was done on August 12th, and it was 
20 done by the County Police. 
21 And, remember, as I said a lot of times 
22 when the police do a statement, then the FBI has to 
23 come along and do their own statement, so after we 
24 hear the statement by the County Police, we will 
25 hear a statement that was done by the FBI.
