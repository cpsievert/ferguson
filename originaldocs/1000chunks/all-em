Q

Disrespectful, very disrespectful. 
And so I understand, is that some of the 
3 reasons why you didn't feel comfortable talking to 
4 Ferguson. Is it Ferguson Police Department that you 
5 have that feeling about or is it all police 
6 officers? 
7 A Not all, Ferguson. 
8 Q And, again, just to clarify, did you ever 
9 witness the officer involved in the shooting?

MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, hi. 
Hi. 
(By Ms. Whirley) When you were interviewed 
19 by the FBI, that would have been August the 12th, a 
20 couple days after this occurred; is that right? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Right. 
A few days, I guess. When you talked with 
23 them, I've read your statement, it indicates that 
24 you thought, it appeared to you that Michael Brown 
25 was trying to get away from the officer when you saw

1 what was going on in the car. Do you still have 
2 that opinion? 
3 A Yeah, they were, I mean, they were just 
4 like, you know, I mean, it is like tussling with 
5 each other. And he was like, I guess, he was trying 
6 to get away and he finally was able to break away 
7 and that's when he walked away. 
8 Q Okay. It appeared to you that the police 
9 officer was actually holding onto Brown as he was 
10 trying to get away? 
11 A Yeah, he was holding, I mean, they was 
12 tussling. They were just tussling. And it was like 
13 one was trying to hold the other, you know what I'm 
14 saying? 
15 Q I do. And at the time that you were 
16 talking to the FBI, you thought it was the officer 
17 that was trying to hold onto Brown? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And Brown was trying to get away, that's 
20 what it appeared to you? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
When you saw the officer, once Brown did 
23 get away, you said he was kind of, the first you 
24 said running, but more walking fast?

Okay. 
He was a big guy and when he broke loose, 
3 he just like went at a fast pace, but not in a total 
4 run. 
5 Q I understand. And he was going in the 
6 opposite direction of the officer? 
7 A Right. Same direction he was going when 
8 the policeman approached him. 
9 Q Approached him, okay. And then you saw 
10 the officer get out of the car and I think in your 
11 statement you said it appeared that he was running 
12 after Brown and his gun was drawn, does that sound 
13 familiar that his gun was drawn?

16 
A 
Q

I'm trying to mentally see. 
Sure, that's what we want you to do. 
Because it has been a while. I don't 
17 really want to deal with it. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
I understand. 
When he got out of the car, he jumped out, 
20 I could see him when he was getting out of the car, 
21 okay. When he got out of the car, wherever his gun 
22 was, he must of had to reach for it because when he 
23 got out, I could see his hand on this side and then 
24 when he got so far, I could see the beginning of the 
25 gun, like he had something in his hand.

5 sidewalk, then what are your thoughts?

Jaywalking, and that's basically what it 
12 was if that's what it was. It just seemed to me it 
13 was just such a, I mean, that's just my point of 
14 view that it was such a minor incident, the boys 
15 didn't have a gun, there was no big deal on just

1 questions I have for you though is that when you 
2 were looking out your window, you said you could see 
3 the hands going back and forth? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q Do you remember telling the FBI agents 
6 that you could see Michael Brown's hands in the 
7 police vehicle? 
A In the window of the vehicle. 8 
9 Q Right. Inside the vehicle, past the 
10 window. If the window were up, the hands were 
11 inside, correct? 
12 A Yeah, if they're wrestling, there's 
13 confrontation, I'm in your window, my hands are in 
14 your window. 
15 Q Okay. From your vantage point, because 
16 when Sheila asked you if you could see Michael Brown 
17 going for or trying to grab the officer's gun and 
18 you said no. 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
I didn't see that. 
So what I want to clarify is, are you 
21 saying that didn't happen because you could see what 
22 was happening, or are you saying, you know, I can't 
23 tell what was going on in the car so I didn't see it

1 could see was their hands going back and forth. 
Q Okay. 2 
3 A I never saw anybody reaching for a gun or 
4 reaching into the car to try to get his gun. In 
5 that case from what I could see, if he had to, if he 
6 reached into the car, he would of had to have been 
7 in some kind of way, no way he could have stood up 
8 straight and reach in the car without me seeing it. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And all I ever saw was the top of his head 
11 and them wrestling through the thing. I never saw 
12 him bend to reach in the car, I never saw the 
13 policeman reaching in his gun holster to get his 
14 gun, all I saw was them wrestling at the thing.

A 
Okay. 
Now, but that don't mean that I didn't, 
17 there's something I could have missed something, but 
18 I did not see anything beyond that. 
19 Q Okay. When you first saw the boys, and 
20 you just said today you really don't recall what 
21 they were wearing in particular. You could see

1 hands, no. I don't recall seeing anything in their 
2 hands. 
3 Q And now, I mean, we know today, we know, 
4 and nobody is disputing that Michael Brown, we know 
5 he did not have a weapon, okay. I'm not trying to 
6 imply that he did when I ask you these questions, 
7 but when you saw him, you couldn't tell if he could 
8 of had a weapon in a pocket, in a waistband, from 
9 your vantage point you wouldn't be able to tell 
10 that, would you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
And once he ran out of your sight, and if 
13 you're here and this building right here, this one 
14 right here, once they run past a certain point, you 
15 can't see beyond that building to what happens, 
16 right? 
17 A No. 
18 Q And so whatever happened after they ran 
19 out of your sight, you can't say one way or another 
20 what happened; is that right, is that fair to say?

3 A No, no, that's what I'm saying. I was

1 A No, but then if I'm looking at you, there 
2 might be some things that I don't see. 
3 Q Uh-huh. 
4 A Some things that my memory don't record. 
5 I'm not going to say what did or did not happen. I 
6 can only tell you what I saw. 
7 Q If, I'm not saying this is true or not, 
8 I'm just asking you to think about this. If the 
9 officer had drawn his weapon and he was holding his 
10 weapon closer to his, the door. In other words, if 
11 he has a right handed holster, and then if he had 
12 removed a weapon and had it closer to the door, 
13 would Michael Brown have been able to, given what 
14 you were judging from his height and from what you 
15 saw where his head was and everything, could he have 
16 touched or reached the weapon if that were the case? 
17 A Well, I guess if the policeman had the gun 
18 up in his, up high enough where he didn't have to 
19 bend to get it or to move his body to get it, I'm 
20 assuming that could have happened, that could 
21 happen. I don't know that. 
22 Q And I think that, I don't want to imply 
23 that you are saying it did or did not happen because 
24 I think it is clear that you don't know. 
25 A

1 Q And that's fair, but when you said you 
2 didn't see him, it couldn't have been like he was 
3 reaching for his gun, are you basing that assumption 
4 on if the officer still had the weapon in his 
5 holster on his right hip, you never saw Michael 
6 Brown go far enough in the vehicle to actually 
7 remove, try to get the gun off of his right hip, 
8 would that be fair to say? 
9 A Yeah, that would be fair to say. I can 
10 say that, that I didn't see that. 
11 Q Okay. But if the gun were already out of 
12 the holster and maybe being held across the 
13 officer's body, is it possible then from where 
14 Michael Brown was, that he could reach the gun 
15 without having to lean in the way you would of 
16 thought he would have to lean? 
17 A Could be. If I was in the same position 
18 and you could see me and he put it up high enough 
19 for me to do it within arms reach, I guess I could 
20 do it to. 
21 Q And, again, I'm not saying one way or 
22 another, I'm just asking you because I think you 
23 made certain assumptions when you were saying he 
24 couldn't reach the gun and that's based upon you 
25 believing that the officer's gun was still in his

Q

Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I know you all have a lot 
5 of questions. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Just one thing. My question 
7 wasn't could he reach the gun, was it did you see 
8 Michael Brown struggling with the officer over the 
9 gun? 
10 A

13

No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: 
MS. ALIZADEH: 
MS. WHIRLEY: 
MS. ALIZADEH: 
That's my question. 
I understand, Sheila. 
I was making it clear. 
I didn't know if she meant 
15 that didn't happen because I saw, I could see it and 
16 it didn't happen, or if her answer was I didn't see 
17 that. 
18 A Well, see what I was saying when I say 
19 that I didn't see him reaching in the car, I did not 
20 see that. All I saw was them tussling at the 
21 window, I never saw him reach in, or anything like 
22 that. 
23 Now, that's not saying that what you 
24 said about the gun as far as the policeman was 
25 concerned that it was in a different position, but

1 when the question was asked of me was, did he reach 
2 in to try to take the cop's gun. And I said, no, I 
3 did not see that. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I think that's, and 
5 these are all just points we are trying to clarify. 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm absolutely not trying 
8 to imply one thing or the other. So questions? 
9 Did 
10 you ever at any time see him stick his head inside 
11 the police car? 
12 A No. 
13 When you, 
14 the first time you saw the two guys walking and the 
15 police approaching them and you say you saw the 
16 police drive away and proceeded on or the young man 
17 proceeded on. When the police came back, could you 
18 tell if he came back in a speedy way or did he just 
19 back up normally? 
20 A What happened was, he said something to 
21 the boys. The boys said something to him. The boys 
22 proceeded to walk away. The policeman must have 
23 thought for a second, he backed up to go back to 
24 where they were. 
25 That's what happened. I mean, he

1 didn't speed up any because they only had gotten a 
2 few feet from him when he decided, when I guess he 
3 wanted to have some more to say to them, he just 
4 backed up. 
5 Okay, thank you. 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 When you saw 
8 Michael Brown's head on the top of the SUV, do you 
9 know if he was wearing anything on his head? 
10 A I think he had a hat on, a cap or 
11 whatever, you know. 
12 
13 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Ma'am, I'm just asking you 
14 if you recall when you talked to the FBI agents, and 
15 these were two women agents, right? 
16 A Right. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you remember telling 
18 them that you saw, and I'm talking about when the 
19 vehicle backed up, that you saw the vehicle jerk and 
20 back up a short distance? 
21 A Yeah, he did. Cause when he backed up he 
22 jerked, like he put his foot on the brake or 
23 something. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: I was trying to clarify 
25 when you were asking about and I wanted to know what

1 you meant about that. 
2 A If the policeman probably wanted to say 
3 something, he didn't want them to get away. So what 
4 he did when he put it, just when he backed it up, he 
5 just put on his brakes real hard, real fast and the 
6 car kind of jerked. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: From your position, did it 
8 look like he came close to hitting the boys or did 
9 his vehicle contact either boy when he backed up? 
10 
11 
A I didn't see that. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
12 You 
13 said you don't know if you want to continue to live 
14 there any more. Do you feel it is because of the 
15 police or because of the residents and the danger or 
16 everything? 
17 A I'm going to move anyway. 
18 Okay. 
19 A I've got a lease and I can't move right 
20 now. I mean, my family's having major problems. 
21 Yeah. 
22 A There's a lot of things that make me want 
23 to move. Too many young people, too much riffraff, 
24 there is shooting, they get out at night, on 
25 weekends and shoot up in the air and all that stuff.

1 The police has been called several 
2 times for it. The apartment managers or owners, or 
3 whoever they are, does nothing about it and all of 
4 that is violations. They should have been gone, but 
5 they do it. 
6 I'm getting too old to be putting up 
7 with the riffraff. They are a bunch of youngsters. 
8 Youngsters are in a learning phase, they do all 
9 kinds of crazy stuff. And I just want to live 
10 somewhere where I don't have to live with all of 
11 that, okay. 
12 Has nothing to do with the cop 
13 shooting the kid or the kid causing the shooting, 
14 whatever it was, had nothing to do with that. But 
15 the aftermath of this is what I'm talking about. 
16 I don't want to live years, all of 
17 the sudden somebody come and either take my life or 
18 shoot me up or beat me up, and I'm abiding by all 
19 the rules or as many of them as I can. I'm not

4 The next thing we're going to do is play a 
5 statement for you. The statement is from a witness 
6 named I believe it's, 
7 , I'll verify that. 
8 She had previously talked to the County 
9 Police, but this is a statement you're going to hear 
10 is a statement that was done yesterday, I believe, 
11 at FBI headquarters. I can't be sure, but the 
12 statement is being taken by, the questioning is 
13 being done by , who is the attorney for the 
14 Department of Justice. You have heard her voice on 
15 several statements. You will also hear the voice of 
16 , who is the assistant United States 
17 attorney who you probably heard his voice on several 
18 statements. 
19 And there is also an FBI agent who is a 
20 female who is a female who pipes in a couple of 
21 times during the statement. I'm not sure as I sit 
22 here today because I listened to this last night 
23 because I got it last night because it happened 
24 yesterday afternoon.
