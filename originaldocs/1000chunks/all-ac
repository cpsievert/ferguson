MS. WHIRLEY: Okay yes, ma'am. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'm trying to get a 
8 clarification. You said that the police officers 
9 had already examined the body, photoing the body, 
10 taking pictures of everything on the body. 
11 Let me understand, when you examined the 
12 body, you searched the pockets and you found the 
13 marijuana, the two $5 bills and the two lighters. 
14 Why wouldn't those objects be outside the pockets if 
15 they had already examined the body? 
16 A They don't actually examine, they just 
17 take photographs. They don't touch the body until I 
18 get there and I can't touch the body until the 
19 detectives get there. We kind of do it in tandem. 
20 We don't want to disturb the scene. They come in 
21 and they photograph everything like it is. I come 
22 in, if I move anything, then they photograph it 
23 again. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: What's the purpose of doing 
25 it in tandem and not the police?

3 around and we all have different information then. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: There is information that 
5 the body may be able to tell the medical examiner or

2 about 2:30 approximately your time. Now, I 
3 understand you stated that after you got to the 
4 scene then you had to wait another hour, is that my

6 A Yes, ma'am, approximately about another

8 So actually your

20 I know they arrived on scene shortly after it 
21 happened. I looked at the body, they didn't have no 
22 leads, any kind of what they usually do is put a 
23 lead on their body for EKGs to see if there is any 
24 kind of heartbeats. None of that was placed on

14 ask a question because we don't know how well this 
15 is all picking up until we listen to this later or 
16 have an opportunity to check it, so if you would 
17 make, you don't have to get right up on it, but make 
18 an effort to kind of speak into the microphone so 
19 that we can be sure that your questions are 
20 recorded, that would be great. If I see you not 
21 doing that because you are not used to it, I might 
22 say, could you get close to the mike, okay.

6 
A They don't get filed with our report. 
Okay, all right. 
Now, you said 
7 that you didn't take photos yourself, you said that 
8 you didn't take photos yourselves? 
9 A Correct. 
10 Upon arriving at the scene 
11 as the batteries had died in your camera? 
12 
13 
A Yes, ma'am. 
All right. So I mean, is 
14 there some protocol with your department that you 
15 have to have your camera charged up all times? 
16 A No, ma'am. 
17 Just to alleviate this 
18 type of thing happening? 
19 A No, ma'am. 
20 So right now we only have 
21 the photos that St. Louis County or whatever --

3 Uh-huh. 
A And maybe that's it. 
Okay.

5 
6 A Anywhere from two to four pictures, no 
7 more than that. Just trying to give the pathologist 
8 a picture of what's going on when this person died. 
9 Okay. 
10 Did you notice 
11 any other wounds on the body hands wise? 
12 A Just the abrasion on the back of the left 
13 hand and abrasion on his face and nothing really 
14 obvious. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And just to 
16 clarify, you said your job is to document the body? 
17 
18 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: As you find it and you also 
19 make a determination if you believe the body has 
20 been moved, was there any reason for you to believe 
21 that the body was moved in this case? 
A No, ma'am. 22 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Now is it your job to look 
24 at anything around the body, whether it be blood 
25 splatters or shell casings?

Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Why not? 
At the time where they were at and they 
21 were still being processed, I guess let the police 
22 take care of that part. They are trying to figure 
23 out what shots were fired and what order, I didn't 
24 see no reason to see where they were at.

1 shells kind of determine how the body was shot, what 
2 angle, how far, the distance? 
3 A They could at times. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: That's not what you are 
5 qualified to figure out? 
6 A Correct. I don't know if they were moved, 
7 kicked around, people trampled through there, things 
8 of that nature. And the semiautomatic weapon, are 
9 the shell casings going to go out to the right side 
10 and eject. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And so your 
12 purpose in being there and your function is to 
13 assist the medical examiner in doing their job? 
14 
15 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You're not there as a 
16 police agent or an agent of any police department? 
17 A Correct. As a matter of fact, my mission 
18 is just for the body. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the medical 
20 examiner? 
21 A Correct. 
22 Whose 
23 responsibility is it to write the whole report 
24 overview of that at the scene, is that the police 
25 department? Obviously, it is not this individual.

Police department. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I anticipate you will be 
3 hearing testimony from the investigators who do 
4 document the crime scene in any kind of crime scene 
5 and especially such as this, there is going to be 
6 probably a number of officers who were doing 
7 different things at the crime scene to process the 
8 scene. 
9 A This crime scene, can I say something? 
10 The crime scene was huge, he's here, some of his 
11 shoes are farther away from him. You have a vehicle 
12 and his hat, it may stretch out 100 yards. I'm just 
13 there for the body. Just trying to let our 
14 pathologist know he's here, there are other things 
15 there, this is what's going on with the body. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: It is your job to take the 
17 body when you leave? 
18 A Correct. And the police will come in and 
19 photograph everything else, document it where it is 
20 at and take their notes. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: 
22 You mentioned 
23 before that when you arrived at the scene and you 
24 saw the body for the first time, he was in the 
25 middle of the road, is that my understanding?
