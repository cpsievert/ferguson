8 
9 
A No. 
Okay. Just some random 
10 guy that said, hey, man take me somewhere. I don't 
11 know what's going on. 
12 A Yeah, he was probably just scared like. I 
13 said, he wasn't getting in no way. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: So to be clear, the point 
15 where Dorian was at the car asking to get in, the 
16 shooting had already occurred? 
17 
18 
A Right. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So before the shooting 
19 occurred, was Dorian at, just kneeling by the car 
20 without saying anything? 
21 A He didn't say nothing, on the second shot, 
22 he didn't say nothing. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: Was he in a position to see 
24 what was going on? 
25 A He was in a position to see everything.

2 question, when you first saw Dorian and Mike 
3 together. 
4 
5 
A Uh-huh. 
MS. WHIRLEY: They were both walking down 
6 the middle of street? 
7 A Uh-huh, on the yellow line. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: On the yellow line. And the 
9 officer, you were behind the officer and he backed 
10 up real fast you said?

16 
A 
A 
A 
Yeah. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Almost hit Mike. 
About hit his foot almost. 
MS. WHIRLEY: You could see that? 
Uh-huh, he jumped back from it. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And was Mike pushing him, 
17 preventing him from getting out of the car from your 
18 view? 
19 A I couldn't see all of that because the 
20 truck was already catty-corner, that's why I was 
21 saying how he ended up right by the police officer's 
22 car. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: The officer almost hit him 
24 he was so close when he came back. 
25 A Yeah, he just, I don't know if he ran up

2 coming open, I don't know, I don't know none of that 
3 part. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. When the car comes 
5 back and Mike Brown is at the door, where is Dorian 
6 at that time because you said they were both walking 
7 down the street, were they both by the door? 
8 
9 
A 
10 probably. 
11 A 
Probably, well, I got to say exactly. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Tell me what you saw, not 
I basically saw him kind of, you know, 
12 slow and walking away from, I guess when Mike Brown 
13 ended up being at the door, he was basically, I saw 
14 him going kind of slow across the street and he ran 
15 off real quick. I guess not wanting to be a part of 
16 it. 
17 
18 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
19 So when the police officer backed up.

1 A No, he didn't, he didn't run then, like I 
2 was saying. I was saying Mike Brown somehow ended 
3 up by the police door. 
4 Michael Brown did? 
5 A Yeah. 
6 At what point did Dorian 
7 leave? 
8 A Basically as this is happening, he is 
9 gradually slow -- slow across and just end up 
10 running, like it wasn't no full-fledge run, like 
11 walking, like he run like this. 
12 So there was nothing 
13 going on between the two men or the police officer, 
14 it was always Michael Brown and Officer Wilson? 
15 A Not yet, not yet. Like I say, whatever, 
16 you know, probably Dorian saw you shut the door on 
17 him, I don't know, I couldn't see that. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: We don't want you to guess, 
19 right, just tell us what you can see. 
20 You can only see their 
21 feet?

2 little bit of a hard --
3 A Right, right. 
4 Okay. 
5 I had one 
6 more question. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila interrupted you, 
8 that was not right. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: No, I didn't. 
10 At any time did Dorian 
11 position himself, to your knowledge, that you could 
12 see, at any time did he position himself at the 
13 trunk of your vehicle and between this other vehicle 
14 that was parked behind you or that was stopped 
15 reportedly behind you? 
16 A The trunk? 
17 The rear part of your

19 A Uh-huh. 
20 Was Dorian ever positioned 
21 there at any time? 
22

The back of the car we was in.

1 A Basically, like I said, the second shot,

3 basically ducking down like this looking, you know, 
4 just looking. 
5 He's like on the passenger 
6 side at the rear portion of your vehicle? 
7 A Yeah, like by the tire. 
8 Okay. Never by the 
9 trunk, okay, thank you. 
10 How soon 
11 would you say the struggle began? 
12 A How long was it I think? 
13 When you said you saw the 
14 police vehicle come back at him at a rapid speed and 
15 stop. 
16 A Uh-huh. 
17 How soon would you say the 
18 confrontation started? 
19 A Oh, man, three seconds. No, like from 
20 Mike Brown being by the door, about three seconds, 
21 might have been two.

So from 
3 your perspective sitting in the car behind the 
4 police vehicle, you know, you said you see feet 
5 moving, Michael Brown was a tall man, could you see 
6 his head over top of the Tahoe or was it --
7 A No, because the way the truck is, like I 
8 say, it is all tinted windows, big glass windows and 
9 you ain't going to see nothing. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: Like over the roof of the

No, because where I'm sitting is down

12 Carlo, it sits low. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: So your position is further 
14 lower? 
15 A Right, yeah. 
16 Did you 
17 happen to notice where Dorian went after the 
18 shooting? 
19 A No. As I told him to go on, we got by the 
20 police car, that's when other police came in. Like 
21 I say, when I got out, I didn't see him nowhere. I 
22 didn't see him on the ground or nothing.

2 A No, they was basically still right there. 
3 They was still right there after the first shot. 
4 And by the time got to we back-back slow, slow, 
5 wasn't no fast move back, this was slow. So by the 
6 time, I guess, probably the time we back-back, it 
7 was probably like what, five or six seconds, that's 
8 when end up seeing him running past her door. 
9 To clarify, 
10 five or six seconds past after the shot before you 
11 saw Michael Brown leaving or running, so he might

8 and forth. 
9 Q I'm not trying to suggest you were trying 
10 to get your stories together, the reason I ask is

12 her about that we would like her, you ever talk 
13 about coming in and talking about this? 
14 A Yeah, but you know, she works every day, 
15 deal with kids every day.

17 at a time that it didn't interrupt her work, do you 
18 think she would come in or is she just not wanting 
19 to be involved, she doesn't return calls? 
20 A I guess, I don't know how she really feels 
21 about it now. I haven't just straight up and down 
22 asked her. 
23 Q Okay. Do you know anybody else who claims 
24 to have seen this that hasn't come forward to the 
25 police or anyone?
