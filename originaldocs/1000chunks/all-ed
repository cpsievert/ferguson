Q 
A 
Yes. 
Why did you do that? 
The guy I was working with, he was talking 
16 to his old boss. Well, you should probably write 
17 that down what happened, and then I probably should 
18 too. 
19 Q Did you guys sit down and write your 
20 statements together at the same time? 
21 A Uh, probably about as far apart as him and 
22 I, but no words were spoken. It was our own 
23 judgment or our own take on the matter. 
24 Q So you didn't like talk about, hey, what 
25 are you going to write, I'm going to write this,

1 Initially, I heard a single shot 
2 fired and peered around the corner to see a black 
3 male walking away, at which time I heard another 
4 shot and saw the white cop behind the black man. I 
5 was about 50 to 60 yards away watching the black man 
6 stumble away from the officer and turn with his 
7 hands raised yelling, okay, okay. 
8 Officer proceeded to unload his clip 
9 into the black man, at least six to seven more 
10 shots. 
11 Thirty minutes before the incident, 
12 fellow co-worker spoke with the black 
13 man who spoke of Jesus and life and honest people. 
14 Mike was his name. He was wearing a Cardinals ball 
15 cap, gray shirt, jean shorts, with yellow pot leaf 
16 socks and sandals. 
17 At the time of the incident after 
18 hearing the first and second shots, I stood there 
19 like a deer in the headlights, stunned to see and 
20 believe what was happening. 
21 Mike said he was going to the 
22 convenience store to get a few things and would be 
23 right back. We were working on his building and 
24 engaged in conversation. He seemed like a nice guy. 
25 Q That is accurate as to how you remembered

A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Now, you didn't mention anything in

11 
A 
Q

Just the pot leafs on the socks. 
Okay. 
It was more, you know, I got to thinking 
12 about it, you know, why was he questioning if we 
13 were upset and why was he, not that I have a lot of 
14 experience with it, I've seen it. That was the 
15 evidence for me. 
16 Q He didn't try to sell you any pot or have 
17 a smoke with you or Steve or anything? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. Did he appear at the time that you 
20 saw him to be a threat to the officer when he was 
21 being shot, when he was coming toward the officer? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. Did he appear to be coming toward 
24 the officer in an aggressive way? 
25 A I mean, that's subjective.

I'm talking your opinion?

I take the hands going down and kind of 
5 moving quicker towards the cop as either I'm falling 
6 to my death or okay, you've already shot me a couple 
7 times, I'm coming at you. 
8 Q So it could be either of those. So when 
9 he had his hands up, what was your impression then 
10 when he was saying okay, okay, okay?

The other person, and his name is Dorian

5 A No, like I said earlier, I never saw him 
6 after he was, they were going to the convenience 
7 store. 
8 Q Okay. You never, I think you already 
9 answered this too, so bear with me. You never, once 
10 you came back after the shooting was over and you 
11 came out, what did you see as far as the scene was 
12 concerned, describe that for us after the shooting 
13 was over. 
14 A All I saw was there was, at this point, 
15 there was three cops. The other two cops showed up, 
16 it must have been as it was happening or right 
17 after. They came up and they are all staring, 
18 looking at the ground. Mike Brown's laying about 
19 right here, and one of the cops grabs a roll of tape 
20 and starts taping it off. 
21 Q Did you notice a police car or just a lot 
22 of police cars around at that point? 
23 A There was an SUV, I believe, right about 
24 in this vicinity and that was

3 Q Were you there much longer after this 
4 shooting occurred or did you get out of there soon 
5 after? 
6 A We got out pretty quick. and I, you 
7 know, he said we probably should go, you know, being 
8 two white guys, that's just my feeling. He said we 
9 should probably get out of here. I think things 
10 about to go -- sorry.

5 that the job got done. 
6 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Now, how did you come to, 
7 since you left that, you did write a statement that 
8 same day, but you left. How did you get to talk to 
9 the police or the FBI about what you saw, how did 
10 that happen? 
11 A Uh, they showed up at my house. I had a 
12 St. Louis County detective show up, and after that 
13 another St. Louis County detective, along with an 
14 FBI agent. And then a third time they picked me up, 
15 took me down to Clayton down here and put me in an 
16 interrogation room and asked me a bunch of questions 
17 that I answered the best I could. 
18 Q Do you know how they found out about you? 
19 How they knew to come to your house? 
20 A I don't know for sure, but if I had to

22 the company I work for from the apartment complex 
23 and so on and so forth.

And where were you when you heard the

21 ground, which didn't make sense to me we had a lot 
22 of pipe on the ground. So I didn't know what it

Because he stumbled. 
And then he turns around, okay. Now at 
3 this point, have you seen the officer at all? 
4 A Not yet. I mean, it was shortly after he 
5 turned around that I saw the cop. 
6 Q Okay. So when he turned around, is Mike 
7 Brown's back to you? 
8 A Uh, they're kind of maybe at a 45 degree 
9 angle from me. 
10 Q Okay. When he was coming in your 
11 direction, whatever pace that is, I didn't want to 
12 say running, okay, coming toward your direction, 
13 could you see his face? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Is that because of your position? 
Well, I mean, I saw the side of his head.

18 he's right here and that's a pretty good distance.

Page 241 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And so at some point 
5 you see the officer appear beyond the building, 
6 correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: And then Michael Brown 
9 turns and moves towards the officer. Does the 
10 officer move then? Is he still coming toward 
11 Michael Brown? 
12 A I mean, after he turned around and had his 
13 hands up, he kind of just stopped and stood there. 
14 And then that's when the shooting occurred. I mean, 
15 he was going, turned around and then started 
16 shooting, and then Michael Brown, Michael Brown was 
17 kind of moving at him like I'm giving up, hands up. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So, now, you said I'm 
19 giving up, hands up. You didn't hear him say that? 
20 A He said, okay, okay, okay, that to me 
21 means --
22 MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to be clear. 
23 When you said that, that was what you are 
24 interpreting, right? 
25 A Yes.

MS. ALIZADEH: So what I'm trying to 
2 figure out is you didn't see Michael Brown fall, 
3 correct? 
4 A He was falling and then he went behind the 
5 building. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: So the building blocked, he 
7 goes beyond the building from your vantage point? 
8 A Yeah, about this area right here.

11 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Right. 
I saw him to about where that white car is 
12 and then he was going down. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: So where is the officer 
14 when that happens? 
15 A He was about, right about this 
16 intersection right here. (indicating) 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: So you can still see the 
18 officer when Michael Brown disappeared from your 
19 view? 
20 A That is correct. He was kind of going 
21 straight when the officer was kind of moving back 
22 and sideways, and he kind of moved at an angle. At 
23 one point, the shots were this way and more went 
24 almost at me.
