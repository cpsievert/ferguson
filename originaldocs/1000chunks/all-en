18 I was on my way to visit a 
19 friend from high school that I thought lived off

1 lost, this is before I had my GPS. I stopped at the 
2 QT. 270 is up here and I stopped at the QT and I 
3 asked for directions. And I didn't follow them very 
4 well, instead of making a right out of QT, I made a 
5 left. And I realized I went the wrong way, so I 
6 made another immediate left. 
7 But then I seen the apartments, my friend 
8 lived in an apartment. I thought, well, maybe I was 
9 in the right spot after all. 
10 And I went down that street and I passed 
11 two streets and then a parking lot and went into the 
12 second parking lot, which is technically the same 
13 one because it loops around a building. And I 
14 pulled in there and I made a left and I parked there 
15 and then I walked back out in front of that building 
16 to ask for directions. 
17 MS. Okay. 
18 And then that's when I seen 
19 the officer's SUV for the first time, it is a bigger 
20 vehicle, for the first time. And he was talking to 
21 two African-American gentlemen. 
22 And then he started to leave and then he 
23 put the car in reverse and said something, and I did 
24 not hear what was said. And then the next thing I 
25 know, the heavier set African-American was in the

1 car from approximately the waist up. And then I 
2 heard the gun go off, I didn't hear any kind of 
3 conversation. I heard noises, but not what was 
4 being said. 
5 I heard the gun go off, I only remember 
6 one gunshot. The skinnier African-American took off 
7 running and the heavier set one that they call Mike 
8 Brown stood up, and I seen him pull his shorts up 
9 and take off running. 
10 The officer got out of the car and had his 
11 left hand on the left side of his face and the gun 
12 in his right hand. And his right hand was shaking 
13 and he was stumbling from one foot to the other, and 
14 I don't know what he said. All I heard was, or I'll 
15 shoot. 
16 And then that's when Michael Brown, the 
17 heavier set, turned around and face-to-face with the 
18 officer and he had his hands out extended like this, 
19 or whatever, kind of like, you know, what are you 
20 going to do. 
21 
22 
MS. Okay. 
He wasn't saying anything at 
23 that time that I heard. And then the officer had 
24 his gun, was drawn and pointed at him, and that's 
25 when Brown started to charge, you know, kind of like

3 
MS. And your hands are clenched. 
Right, his hands were 
4 clenched at this time. He was slightly bent, but 
5 not much. It was kind of like a football charge 
6 not, you know, and then that's when the gunshots 
7 started. 
8 I don't remember the sequence or the 
9 order. I know that the gun went off a couple of 
10 times and then stopped and then went off again. 
11 And then when the last gunshot went off, 
12 which was in the head, that's when I started to get 
13 freaked out and I got in my car and I left. As I 
14 was leaving, I couldn't go out the same parking lot 
15 I had come in, they had, that was all blocked. So I 
16 zigzagged through the parking lot and I popped out 
17 the third one over here, and I made a right and went 
18 through the neighborhood. 
19 I got lost in there for about 20 minutes, 
20 but I ended up on a street that goes in a complete 
21 circle and then I made a right and popped out on a 
22 side road next to QT, which is where I asked the 
23 person at QT again where the nearest highway was. 
24 MS. So let me go back and ask you 
25 some questions I have.

15 you said you ended up by an apartment complex. You 
16 thought it was your friend's apartment complex, what 
17 made you think that? 
18 Because she had said she 
19 lived in apartments right off Florissant. And I 
20 thought she meant right off Florissant, she meant in 
21 Florissant. I never did find my friend.

4 No, once I got in there

4 I grabbed a black checkbook 
5 instead of a brown checkbook or blue checkbook. 
6 MS. Did you get convicted of 
7 anything? 
8 Yes, because my dad, even 
9 though it was an accident, it is still my signature 
10 and the adult thing to do would be to accept

19 to ask for directions, was there somebody that you 
20 were going over to ask directions or were you just 
21 looking for somebody?

18 the average person, especially a woman in a 
19 neighborhood that you don't know.

5 they were talking the first time. And no, I didn't

7 He was just kind of driving up next to him.

9 ask this guy for directions or was your attention 
10 diverted to the police car? 
11 I started to ask him, and 
12 then I lit a cigarette, and then my attention became 
13 drawn to the police car. That's why I had to ask 
14 directions again at QT. 
15 MS. Was the guy you are talking to, 
16 was he watching was going on also?

15 prosecutor. A good witness is somebody who is 
16 truthful. And that's all it takes to be a good 
17 witness, right, nobody should be a professional 
18 witness, right. Because we just ask about what we 
19 see going on in our daily lives.

1 actually get step by step instructions. I'm not 
2 good on directions. So I couldn't get ahold of 
3 anybody, I didn't have of my cell phone on me at the 
4 time so. 
5 MS. Okay. So you see, you are at 
6 the part where you see some sort of interaction 
7 between the police officer and Michael Brown, 
8 because your statement is based upon what you, 
9 yourself, saw. You could tell there was some sort 
10 of interaction, correct? 
11 Correct. I didn't realize 
12 that the officer was even an officer. When I first 
13 pulled in, or whatever, he was coming this way, I 
14 guess, and I never even acknowledged that he was an 
15 officer when I pulled in. 
16 MS. What sort of vehicle was he in? 
17 Looks like one of those like 
18 van or SUV type.

Big vehicles. 
Was it marked? 
Yes, it had police and then

25 you didn't realize he was an officer?

1 I wasn't paying any 
2 attention. I was so focused on staring at the 
3 building numbers that when I pulled in, or whatever, 
4 and I passed and there was a lot of people standing 
5 right here, I just pulled in right away. It wasn't 
6 until I got out and walked this way, or whatever, 
7 that I realized that, you know, that it was even an 
8 officer. I was going to wait and just get 
9 directions from the guy because the officer was 
10 already busy. 
11 MS. Okay. My next question was, 
12 did you consider getting directions from the 
13 officer. 
14 I didn't, no, because he was 
15 already occupied. 
16 MS. Okay. 
17 And he looked very occupied. 
18 MS. All right. So after you see 
19 this interaction between Michael Brown and the 
20 officer, then what's the next thing you see? 
21 After the first altercation? 
22 MS. We are just talking about step 
23 by step. 
24 Okay.

1 you see him before you spoke to the man about 
2 directions; is that right? 
3 Correct. 
4 MS. And then what? 
5 And then the officer goes 
6 up, you know, like he's going to drive away, he 
7 doesn't really go too far, just a few rolls of the 
8 tire, or whatever. And then he comes back, or 
9 whatever, you know, comes and backs up. And Dorian 
10 and Michael Brown, Brown walked up to the car and 
11 words were exchanged and then Brown entered into the 
12 vehicle from the waist up. 
13 MS. Let me ask you when you say 
14 words were exchanged, what do you mean by that? 
15 The officer's mouth was 
16 moving. I have no idea what was said. 
17 MS. I'm just asking why you chose 
18 that phrase. 
19 Right. 
20 MS. You use that phrase exchange, 
21 the officer's mouth was moving, was there any--
22 I did not hear Mike Brown. 
23 MS. Were you able to see Mike 
24 Brown's face at that point?

1 was here on the sidewalk and the officer's car was 
2 kind of cockeyed or crooked, or whatever, and Brown 
3 was right at the window. 
4 MS. Your vantage point was of the 
5 driver's side? 
6 Correct. 
7 MS. Based on what you are 
8 describing now. Okay. And so you see words were 
9 exchanged and then what happened? 
10 The officer had words. 
11 
12 
MS. Okay. 
I seen him talking, but I 
13 don't know what he had said. And then the next 
14 thing I know, Mike Brown was lunging into the car, 
15 like dived in and it was only from the waist up that 
16 he was in the car. 
17 MS. What was your reaction when you 
18 saw this? 
19 My honest reaction? 
MS. Yeah, absolutely. 20 
21 I was cussing. At the time 
22 I was just like, I actually even said to the guy, is 
23 he F-ing crazy. 
24 MS. You can use the language, we 
25 have heard worse, we've said worse.

I said, is he fucking crazy. 
MS. Okay. 
3 And then it just starts 
4 happening, I didn't say anything more than that. 
5 After the gun went off, I did say damn and then I 
6 said shit, and then I got really nervous. 
7 MS. I don't need a litany of curse 
8 words you used. I just kind of want to understand 
9 your reaction to what is going on. So you see, you 
10 said lunge in and from how far down his body? 
11 To about his belt, naval. 
12 MS. Okay. And that's when, and 
13 your reaction was one of, I guess, surprise, right? 
14 I had never seen anybody 
15 treat an officer like that way before. 
16 MS. What was Dorian doing at the 
17 time? 
18 At that time he punched the 
19 car door shut because he punched it with his wrist 
20 and he punched it with his wrist, something gold 
21 fell off his hand out of his right wrist I think. 
22 MS. Let me ask you this. At what 
23 point did the door open to get punched shut by 
24 Dorian? 
25 When did it open?

MS. Okay. So when you're saying,

5 about Dorian punching the door shut, that's after 
6 the gunshot? 
7 Before the gunshot. 
8 MS. Okay. 
9 Once the gunshot went off, 
10 Dorian took off. 
11 MS. Okay. Let's back up a little 
12 bit. 
13 I'm sorry. 
14 MS. No, no, no, don't apologize. 
15 When you see the officer saying some sort of words 
16 to Michael Brown, Michael Brown is by the door, was 
17 the door open or closed? 
18 At that time the door was 
19 shut. 
20 MS. Okay. 
21 He attempted to open it, 
22 because it did open, it did unlatch.

2 It started to open, you 
3 could tell that it was definitely in the process of 
4 opening. 
5 MS. Okay. And then how did it 
6 close? 
7 With Michael Brown's hands. 
8 MS. You are showing 
9 The base of his hands, he 
10 shoved it shut the first time, and then the second 
11 time he, I can't, I don't know. I don't know if it 
12 was his fist or with his gut. 
13 MS. You are saying the officer 
14 tried to open the door twice in a row? 
15 Correct. 
16 MS. When did Dorian get involved 
17 with that? 
18 That was right after the 
19 second time he went up and punched the rear view

4 first, but only went up to his naval into the 
5 window.

7 officer was doing when Mike Brown did that, when he 
8 went through the window? 
9 He was getting punched.

MS. How can you tell? 
Because Mike Brown's fist 
12 kept going up and down. You knew he was getting 
13 hit, even though he was all the way back. 
14 MS. When you say he was getting hit 
15 all way back, you talking about who? 
16 The officer was being shoved 
17 back. 
18 MS. Okay.

20 of him from the waist up and Brown's fist was going 
21 up and down on the side.
