11 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. So prior to today 
12 was it this weekend you did that?

And you listened to them? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Do you hear Darren Wilson making a call on 
20 any of those other channels? 
21 
22 
A No, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I have those. I don't know 
23 if it would be kind of pointless to play it. He's 
24 listened to them and he doesn't hear Officer Wilson 
25 on any of those channels. All right. Go ahead,

2 You had 
3 mentioned that dispatch has the cell phone numbers

You talked about 
18 the dead zone potentially in Canfield there. If 
19 someone is on the receive only channel like channel 
20 three, they would get that tone, would you get that 
21 tone in a dead channel? 
A On a dead channel? 22 
23 I'm sorry, on a dead zone. 
24 You were in a dead zone, you were on like that

A No, you would just get static. 1 
2 It doesn't even know and 
3 so forth. Would that be the same thing with the 
4 alert button in an accident situation? 
5 A If I hit the alert button right now, they 
6 would actually hear. 
7 So it is a repeating 
8 process, right, until it finally hits a beacon or 
9 whatever? 
A Exactly. 10 
11 Is that operating on a 
12 different frequency? I'm trying to figure out how 
13 the alert button gets out, but the general 
14 transmission does not, we know it does? 
15 
16 
A It doesn't. The workings of that 
MS. ALIZADEH: That would probably be a 
17 question that could answer. If you want 
18 me to find out and bring him back or whatever. 
19 You say the alert button 
20 would get through? 
21 A Oh, yeah. 
22 Okay. 
23 Just one question. 
24 You mentioned that Darren Wilson was 
25 assisting on this sick call, I think was, was it 24;

1 is that correct.

3 
A No, he wasn't assisting on a call. 
MS. ALIZADEH: The dispatcher we're going 
4 to hear the call. She's going to interpret for us 
5 who is going on. What does 10-8 mean, all this 
6 lingo that's said during these calls. She's going 
7 to be able to kind of translate that for us on what 
8 calls who was going on and who was assisting and so 
9 forth. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Maybe what you are talking 
11 about, we had asked what is he assigned to sector 
12 four and you said he was not? 
13 A No. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: So we're just trying to 
15 figure out what he was doing in that general 
16 location? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
A 
Right. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So can you tell us? 
He was on a prior call at a disturbance at 
20 one of our other apartment complexes and when he 
21 went 10-8 from there, he went onto a sick case at 
22 another apartment complex. He was in that general 
23 area anyway, four sector. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: And so it's not prohibitive 
25 for a sector car to leave their sector?

Q 
Page 64 
No, ma'am. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And you talk about the 
3 facts that sector has to go on call or leave their 
4 sectors that one of the roaming cars or cover cars 
5 might move into that area just to make sure there's 
6 coverage? 
7 A Uh-huh.

10 Hills, or what was the other one?

12 
A 
Q 
Country Club Hills. 
Country Club Hills officer who chimes and 
13 he's responding to a call in Ferguson, correct? 
14 A Yes, yes. 
15 Q So other municipalities that are listening 
16 to this radio traffic, they can also come into your 
17 jurisdiction and respond to an emergency or 
18 something? 
19 A You got to remember we dispatch for two 
20 other municipalities, they are on our frequency and 
21 they monitor everything that we're doing.

23 someone that's Victor 2?

So when someone calls out and they say

13 A Yes. 
14 Q And then the dispatcher and you also told 
15 me that usually will even recognize their voices? 
16 A Yes. We do have one other municipality 
17 which became a police department, which is Flordell 
18 Hills.

Four sector. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And just to kind of lay 
8 out what happens on these radio calls. First of all 
9 the calls begin, the recordings begin in the middle 
10 of a shift, correct? 
A Yes. 11 
12 Q So there is other calls that we are not 
13 playing where officers were out on other calls. So 
14 when we start on the call, initially there is talk 
15 about a caller who says that a man with a gun, or a 
16 man has threatened her and he's left. He lives in 
17 the apartment complex and she thinks he might have 
18 left to go get a gun? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And this a subject maybe going to get a 
21 gun, would it be typical for more than one car to 
22 respond to that? 
23 A Yes. Officers hear that, they don't have 
24 to hear anything from the supervisor, that's all 
25 automatic for them. As long as they tell the

1 dispatcher, Frank 21, I'll be assisting or Frank 21 
2 I will be en route. When they hear gun, you pretty 
3 much get the calvary coming into the area. There 
4 are several. 
5 Q We hear on those calls that the traffic 
6 amongst themselves and one guy says, I'm going to go 
7 behind the building and they're looking for somebody 
8 and they are communicating with themselves?

11 
12

Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Each other?

17 
18 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Only one of them it was his sector? 
Right. 
So other cars go there to assist? 
That officer whose sector that is, he was 
19 out on a sick case. The three officers are 
20 responding to that call are actually assisting that 
21 officer because he's out on another call. 
22 Q And this is something that experienced 
23 officers just kind of learn to do, is that fair to 
24 say?

No, you didn't. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) They hear this traffic, 
3 they know who's busy, they know what's going on and 
4 something else, they know street numbers, they know 
5 street names, they know problem places, correct? 
6 A They know everything. Those officers, 
7 they could tell by the officer's tone of his voice 
8 that I need to get their quick, that's how the 
9 officers are tight. 
10 Q And you and your dispatcher even told me 
11 today when we were listening to these calls that she 
12 could hear that there was a problem in Officer 
13 voice?

2 About the 
3 dead zone, how long have you been an officer in that 
4 area? 
5 A I've been in Ferguson 27 years. 
6 Are these deadzones more 
7 like word of mouth or is there any kind of 
8 documentation? 
9 A It is documented by complaints from 
10 officers and stuff. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you when we were 
12 listening to the calls, in fact, isn't there a call 
13 where you hear static and then suddenly could hear 
14 the officer talking? 
A Yes. 15 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: You describe when your

18 he's walking.

A 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Do you know which complex? 
Parkridge Apartments. 
Parkridge Apartments. And 
6 then he went to a different complex to assist on a 
7 sick call. 
8 A No, he was actually the primary on that 
9 sick call, he was the only officer. When I say 
10 assist, when I say that, he assists in the sector 
11 car, so he doesn't have to jump off of that call to 
12 go run all the way over here. So when I say assist, 
13 he is just assisting the sector car. So he doesn't 
14 have to go 10-8 for the call. 
15 
16 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And 10-8 means? 
A Clear a call, I'm off the call. 
17 Q I'm done, I'm back in service, I can take 
18 another call? 
19 A Exactly. 
20 Now, when this happened, 
21 when this incident occurred, between him and Michael 
22 Brown, was he on his way to that sick call or he had 
23 completed it?

1 in a dead zone you are going to. 
2 You are getting the tone 
3 from the dead channel, you aren't in the frequency 
4 of anything? 
5 
6 
A It doesn't have anything on it, right. 
And I'm trying to 
7 clarify. You said the dispatcher overrides the 
8 scans of the RIOT channel. If somebody is listening 
9 to the RIOT channel and the dispatcher from Ferguson 
10 comes on, all officers are needed at such and such, 
11 they will override, the officers will hear that? 
12 A They will go point-to-point, they won't go 
13 to the RIOT channel. Dispatchers will go to 
14 point-to-point. 
15 And the officers will 
16 hear that? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Point-to-point is hear 
19 only? 
20 A That's hear only, it is not a receiver. 
21 And I just had another 
22 question about you said that Officer Wilson had a 
23 newer model mobile device in his car? 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. 
But he didn't have a

1 newer model portable walkie. 
2 A No, ma'am, they're still the old walkies. 
3 Does that have any 
4 bearing on what's being heard, what's being 
5 transmitted? 
6 A No. 
7 Seems like we have a lot 
8 of variables here. We have a newer mobile device, 
9 an old portable device, we have an area that's known 
10 to be a dead zone. We have different channel 
11 
12 
frequency. 
A 
I'm just trying to find out --
The newer radios, and I'm sure 
13 went through this, but the newer radios are going to 
14 be more microwaveable. So you are going to hear 
15 more from them, but they are still on the old 
16 system. 
17 Okay. 
18 A And that's because we're still on the old 
19 system with our walkies and our dispatch center. As 
20 soon as that 800 megahertz gets updated and ready to 
21 go. We'll have new walkies, which are coming pretty 
22 soon. We will have a new dispatcher center and new 
23 radios and everything will tie in together. 
24 Right now we are using a newer radio 
25 with our old system, which works just as good.

MS. ALIZADEH: If there are problems with 
2 the old system, the new radios aren't going to solve 
3 those problems? 
4 A No. 
5 Until you get the new 
6 system? 
7 A Right. The new system we shouldn't have 
8 dead zones, we shouldn't have problems. 
9 This is a real important 
10 question for me to understand. You said that you 
11 checked all the channels to see if a call was made 
12 from Darren Wilson on his portable to any other 
13 channel and you couldn't find one? 
14 A When I say that, we have certain channels 
15 on our recording device. We have what they call 
16 trunk systems. 911 we have five trunks. 
17 What it is, say you are dialing 911 
18 into me, then all of the sudden she dials 911 that 
19 will go to trunk two and then all of the sudden he 
20 dials 911, that's going to go to the next trunk 
21 system three. So we have a bunch of systems in 
22 there going because we constantly get 911 calls. 
23 So what I did was, I go back and 
24 check all the trunks on the 911 system and I also 
25 check point-to-point, I check the fire station, the

2 We have backup, our police backup. I 
3 will use the police backup because it is a clearer 
4 and more. I mean, you can hear everything in there. 
5 When you're on the backup system, you can actually, 
6 somebody wants a tape or something, I will just go 
7 straight to that. I won't just use the main channel 
8 because you don't get the static, you don't get the 
9 cars, people talking behind them. It will be a 
10 clearer sound. 
11 And then also we have our phone 
12 numbers. You know, we come in with 522-3100, then 
13 it keeps going. They have all the detectives' 
14 numbers in there and everything else. 
15 So the list of everything I'm looking 
16 at is probably about this long. (indicating) 
17 So with your experience 
18 and the information that you were able to tell, it 
19 does not appear as though he tried to make a all 
20 from his portable?

5 
6 
7 
A Right. 
Okay. Thank you. 
I 
8 just have some clarification. You said that Frank 
9 22 and Frank 25 were dispatched on the way to the 
10 Ferguson Market incident; is that correct? 
11 A When the call came out of Ferguson Market, 
12 Frank 25 was actually the primary on that call. 
13 Okay. 
14 A You got to realize that apartment complex 
15 is only a block away, not even a block. So they're 
16 leaving that area and he is right there. All he has 
17 to do is come out of an entrance and go right into 
18 Ferguson Market. 
19 Okay. And then if I'm not 
20 mistaken, you said that, you said that Officer 
21 Darren Wilson, he called into dispatch to see if the 
22 officer needed any assistance, is that my 
23 understanding? 
24 A If he was needed in the area or whatever. 
25 I guess to help look for the subjects or something.

MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Just one last thing for me. 
14 So when Officer Wilson called out that he had two on 
15 wherever and to send a car, that transmission 
16 obviously was received? 
17 A Yes, it was. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That reporting? 
A Yes. 
18 
19 
20 So that means, I'm sorry, 
21 Juror Number 9. He was on the right channel to 
22 receive that call?

25 them?

1 A He had to be on channel one because that 
2 was on channel one dispatch, but he was in his 
3 vehicle, so he's in a mobile unit not on his 
4 walkie-talkie. 
5 Okay. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Could you tell he was on 
7 mobile or walkie-talkie when he was in his car? 
8 A You can hear by the static in the radios.

2 or static, I guess is what comes up? 
3 A If he's on, if he's on like say three, 
4 even if he was in a dead zone, he would get a tone. 
5 He would still get a tone? 
6 A Yes. Even if you're in like Wal-Mart and 
7 a building with concrete or metal they couldn't get 
8 out and he's on three accidently, he would still 
9 hear that, that tone, that real loud. 
10 Okay. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Is that it? 
12 The first 
13 call that Officer Wilson sent out when he asked do 
14 they need assistance, that was to the other police

11 A 
12 Q Now, ma'am, the microphones that are in

17 A Okay. 
18 Q And because the court reporter is taking 
19 down what you are saying and we are recording what's 
20 being said, your answers all have to be out loud.
