2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. This is Photograph 
3 Number 37. That's on your other report beginning 
4 with, I think, Q22, correct? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And this was submitted another day. 
7 What did you do with this item? 
8 A I swabbed this hat for wear DNA just 
9 because it wasn't identified on the receipt as 
10 belonging to someone in particular. So I just 
11 swabbed areas that would touch skin. If you're 
12 wearing it on the hat, it is the inner rim of the 
13 hat of the bill. 
14 Q This is number 38, also a photograph of 
15

the Cardinal baseball cab, 
A Yes. 
Q You just gave us 
A Yes. 
correct? 
another view of it I see? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
Q All right. And then Number 39. So you 
also took photographs of the flip flops that you 
were told he was wearing; is that right? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And that's 39 and 40, which I will show in 
24 a moment. Did you do anything with that spot that's 
25 there that we're looking at?

MS. WHIRLEY: We had an interruption for 
3 the alarm sounding. We are good now. So we were on 
4 Number 39, Photograph Number 39 and Number 40, which 
5 we will show in a minute. They are both pictures of 
6 the flip flops that you were told Michael Brown was 
7 wearing, correct? Tell us was there anything of 
8 evidentiary value that was lifted from those flip 
9 flops? 
10 A Well, I tested orange brown stain for 
11 possible blood. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Is that what we are looking at here? 
For Q23, I tested reddish brown stain on 
14 the outside left side, so yes. 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
(By Ms. Whirley) Everybody see that stain? 
And then I also, let me see. I also 
17 swabbed the top of the sole area and the under side 
18 of the strap, the white strap, for trace for who was 
19 wearing. Again, like the hat, I didn't know who it 
20 belonged to. 
21 Q Okay. And this is Number 40. We see a 
22 little speck on 40 too, did you test that also? 
23 A I did. I tested, my notes one of four 
24 small reddish brown stains. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And did you confirm it to be blood?

1 A The quantity was not sufficient so I 
2 didn't confirm it. And then I also, like the other 
3 flip flop I swabbed, I will show you, I swabbed the 
4 sole area and then underneath the strap for trace. 
5 Q And this is 41. This was submitted to 
6 you, correct? 
7

9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What did you do with this? 
Again, there was no one code as to who it 
10 belonged to. To get a wear DNA, I just swabbed the 
11 entire bracelet for trace DNA. 
12 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
So that's a bracelet? 
Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And just to be clear 
15 because we have two bracelets, this is the bracelet 
16 that is rubber with yellow, white and black 
17 coloring? 
18 A I described it as black, yellow and white 
19 rubber rainbow type. 
20 
21

2 Were these his

4 MS. WHIRLEY: We'll talk to the DNA person 
5 to see if anything of evidentiary value came from 
6 the swabbing because you really can't talk about 
7 that, correct?

1 you tell me of the items, of the items you tested, 
2 you found apparent blood on the officer's pant leg, 
3 correct? Did you test that stain on the officer's 
4 pant leg? 
5 A I tested the swabs, I didn't doubly test 
6 it, so I tested the swabs that came from the crime 
7 scene from the pant. 
8 Q 
9 blood? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Okay. And did you determine that was 
Yes, they were blood. 
And you didn't see any apparent blood on 
12 the shirt of the officer, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q And then, you know, we've talked about the 
15 shirt of Michael Brown, the pant and the socks all 
16 had apparent blood on them, correct? 
17 A Or confirmed blood, yes. 
18 Q Or confirmed. I'm mixing my terms. 
19 Apparent is when you're not you sure what it is, but 
20 it looks like it? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And then on the sandals, you didn't have 
23 enough to confirm that it was blood; is that right? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes. 
And then what about the swab from the gun,

1 there were two swabs submitted from the gun. Did 
2 you test those swabs? 
3 A I tested that for blood. Yes, the swabs, 
4 they were, they had reddish brown stains and black 
5 stains on the swab. Since it had a reddish brown 
6 stain, I tested it for blood. It was presumptively 
7 positive for blood, but the quantity was not 
8 sufficient for confirmatory testing. Again, I 
9 didn't want to

Q 
A 
Q

Q 
Destroy the sample? 
Yes. 
Consume the sample? 
Yes. 
That was presumptive positive for blood, 
15 but you didn't do a confirmatory test and you 
16 forwarded that to the DNA section, would that be 
17 right? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then what about the swabs from the 
20 interior of the door of the police vehicle, did you 
21 test those swabs? 
22 A I tested, well, there were, there were 
23 several. So you're saying that interior, I received 
24 numerous swabs from the car. Do you mean in 
25 general, or you want me to go through each one?

Q Well, I'm thinking in particular there 
were photographs that were taken by that 
3 there was reddish brown stain on the driver's side, 
4 on the driver's door, on the inside of the door? 
5 A Okay. So what I have is Q12 was a swab 
6 with reddish brown stains from the driver rear 
7 passenger exterior door.

Yes. 
Let's go back. You talked about the swab 
20 that you received that was from the exterior rear 
21 driver's door. 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And I recall we had a photograph that was 
24 taken by that had a reddish brown spatter

1 that is the swab that you tested, what did you 
2 determine about that? 
3 A I determined that it was blood of probable 
4 human origin. 
5 Q Is that a presumptive test or is that a 
6 confirmatory test? 
7 A It is confirmatory for blood, but it is 
8 presumptive for the species just because there has 
9 been reporting of some upper primates and ferrets 
10 producing the same result. So we say probable human 
11 origin for that. 
12 And since it was on the exterior of 
13 the car, that's why I wanted to do that to test or 
14 give a possible species result just because it was 
15 outside the car. 
16 Q So it is conclusive for blood on the 
17 outside of the door, conclusive for the blood on the 
18 inside of the door, conclusive or presumptive for 
19 blood on the gun? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then conclusive for blood on the swabs 
22 that were on the pant leg for the stain on the pant

1 already testified about that. 
2 Did you do any blood, did you test 
3 for blood on the apparent skin or hardened nasal 
4 mucus? I know you said you took a sample from that 
5 to forward to the DNA section, did you test it for 
6 blood? 
7 A I did. I confirmed it for blood and also 
8 for presumptive species for that was positive.

A 
Q 
And that was on the outside of the car as 
Yes. 
And all of these things that tested 
13 positive for blood were forwarded to the DNA lab, 
14 the DNA section, correct? 
15 A Not every item, but the probative items I 
16 confirmed blood on, such as Michael Brown's 
17 clothing, those samples weren't forwarded. I can go 
18 through each of the items that I did forward, I have 
19 a sheet. 
20 Q Well, if I asked you the skin/nasal mucus, 
21 that actually a sample got forwarded to the DNA 
22 section, correct? 
23 A Yes.

A Yes. 2 
3 Q The blood that you confirmed on the inside 
4 of the driver's door, that went to DNA? 
A Yes. 5

A Yes.

9 
10 
11 Q And then the, now, you said that you could 
12 not do a confirmatory test on what you detected was 
13 presumptive positive for blood on the gun swabs, but 
14 you forwarded those swabs to the DNA section, 
15 correct? 
16 A Yes.

18 the swabs, places you swabbed for trace evidence. 
19 On the officer's shirt that was forwarded to the DNA 
20 section, correct?

6 When you 
7 get through swabbing, does it automatically go 
8 directly to the DNA or someone comes behind you, is 
9 there another step between you and the DNA testing? 
10 A No. Once I would do any testing that I 
11 need to do, then I also sample it and prepare the 
12 sample for DNA, and then it will be put into a 
13 refrigerator until the DNA analyst takes it.

Approximately 1,400. 
Okay. Can you tell us, a case comes to

14 A Sure. Generally evidence is collected 
15 from a scene or from a hospital or from other 
16 medical examiner's office, et cetera. That evidence 
17 is submitted to the laboratory and a biologist or 
18 biological screener obtains that evidence from the 
19 vault, they process it for whatever bodily fluids or 
20 potential DNA may be there. 
21 They perform their testing and they

13 You provided us with a CD on, I guess 
14 a little animated feature regarding DNA section? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
This film, you put it together for us; is 
17 that correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
To kind of give us a little illustration 
20 of what DNA is and how it works. So that might be 
21 helpful and kind of break up the afternoon. So let 
22 me get it started here. Can you see all right from 
23 where you are or do you want to stand up? 
24 A I think I can see all right. I can stand 
25 up if need be.

Q All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You might be able to

4 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Tell us that first slide. 
5 That first slide, DNA processing, talk to us about 
6 it and then indicate to Kathi when she should go to 
7 the next slide. 
8 A Sure. So if at any point you all have 
9 questions, feel free to interrupt me. If I start 
10 talking too fast or anything. 
11 So this first slide is giving a 
12 little bit of background information on what 
13 forensic DNA testing is and the type we perform in 
14 our laboratory. We do what is called nuclear DNA 
15 testing. That just means that we're looking at DNA 
16 that's in the nucleus of a cell. 
17 So if you think of an egg, would be 
18 like the egg yoke. That's where the nucleus is. 
19 And more specifically the technology 
20 that we use is called short tandem repeat or STR. 
21 Basically the thing to take away is that we are not 
22 sequencing genomes here, we are not able to 
23 determine if there's genetic diseases or any sort of 
24 information like that. 
25 We're actually looking at areas of

1 the DNA that are, what we call junk DNA. So they're 
2 just sequences that are scattered throughout the 
3 genome that differ from person to person, but they 
4 don't have any known function, so they are not 
5 genes. 
6 Q All right. So next slide? 
7 A So here is a little graphic of DNA. It is 
8 basically a chemical blueprint of your body. We get 
9 half of our DNA from our mother and half from our 
10 father. It varies from person to person and it is 
11 found in almost all cells in the human body. So 
12 again, I mention the nucleus. Any cell that has a 
13 nucleus is going to contain nuclear DNA. Next. 
14 This is just a little slide on what 
15 exactly I mean by short tandem repeat. Essentially, 
16 you have a little segment that is usually by four 
17 base pairs long that repeats over and over again. 
18 And so in forensics, what we do is actually 
19 determine how many times that little unit repeats. 
20 So you can see here there is an 
21 illustration of that. You can see there is seven 
22 repeats there on the top and eight on the bottom. 
23 I also mentioned that we get half of 
24 our DNA from our mother and half from our father. 
25 So for all of your chromosomes you basically have a

1 pair of each chromosome, so one from mom and one 
2 from dad. So in this illustration, perhaps the 
3 seven repeats came from mom and the eight repeats 
4 came from dad. So that's essentially what STR 
5 technology is. 
6 The way that we're able to actually 
7 obtain the DNA profile is something called 
8 polymerase chain reaction, basically it is just a 
9 fancy word for copying for amplification. We are 
10 able to target specific areas on the DNA and amplify 
11 millions of copies of those so that it can be 
12 detected by an instrument. So again, we are not 
13 sequencing genomes, we are just looking at very 
14 specific points on the DNA. 
15 Just another thing that's important 
16 to note. I know on CSI and shows like that they 
17 sort of just get a profile and they magically know 
18 who it is, but in reality it is just like 
19 fingerprints where you have to have reference DNA 
20 from an individual to obtain what their profile is 
21 to compare it to the case. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So when you say 
23 reference, you are talking about some known sample? 
24 A Yes. 
25 Q So if you take my blood or my buccal swab

1 and you are comparing it, I'm the reference sample?

6 copying. 
7 A 
8 Q 
That's correct. 
Not just some unknown entity out there? 
Right. 
And then when you talked about the 
Yes. 
Is that what allows you to get a DNA 
9 sample from something as minute as a little blood 
10 stain? 
11 A That's correct, yes. With older 
12 technologies like RFLP that's mentioned on the 
13 slide, you needed a blood stain about the size of a 
14 quarter. Whereas now with PCR you can get DNA 
15 profile from a tiny speck of blood or even 
16 potentially skin cells left behind from someone 
17 grasping an object. 
18 Q So sometimes when the police aren't able 
19 to get a fingerprint sample, they may, latent print, 
20 you may be able to find with DNA?

Or DNA sample or profile, rather, of 
Yes. 
Okay.

1 A And it is also important to note at all 
2 stages we have controls that are run along with the 
3 samples, both positive and negative controls, just 
4 to make sure that all the reagents are free of 
5 contamination and that the analyst isn't introducing 
6 any contamination. 
7 Q That raises another question. What do you 
8 do to make sure your own DNA isn't getting into 
9 sloughing or flaking off into things that you are 
10 testing? 
11 A Yes, there is couple things that we do. 
12 We wear protective equipment, so lab coats, masks, 
13 gloves, we change gloves in between samples, we use 
14 all of the consumables, et cetera, are one-time use. 
15 We don't reuse any of the plastics. 
16 The second thing is we actually have 
17 all of our DNA profiles in a local database. So 
18 every sample that we run, we crosscheck it against 
19 all of the individuals in the laboratory to insure 
20 that we are not being detected in the sample. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question. Talking 
22 about the copying or amplification, I know in some 
23 cases I've had where the report will say that there 
24 wasn't a sufficient amount of DNA to obtain a 
25 profile. Why can't you just, can't you just copy it

1 over and over again until you can get a big enough 
2 thing to test? 
3 A Yes. So when you see that sometimes in 
4 our record, we do actually amplify all samples, even 
5 if the, well, I guess there's a step before it 
6 called quantitation, where we estimate how much DNA 
7 is there. Some labs stop at the quantitation step, 
8 if there is no DNA indicated in the samples. We go 
9 ahead and carry it through and amplify everything. 
10 So when that sentence appears in the 
11 report, it just indicates that basically the result 
12 that we got, there was just not information there to 
13 do a comparison. We weren't able to amplify enough 
14 to get a result. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Is it possible that you 
16 wouldn't have any DNA in that sample? 
17 A It is possible, yes. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So when you say you amplify 
19 it, it undergoes a process whether you know there's 
20 DNA there or not? 
21 A 
22 samples. 
23 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. We go ahead and amplify all the 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
Yes. I think that's all for this slide. 
And so this is sort of a little bit

1 technical here. This just goes through the various 
2 steps. You can see the first step shows a biologist 
3 with an alternate light source. Typically that's 
4 used to look for semen or potentially saliva stains. 
5 We don't usually use this to look for blood. You 
6 probably see that on CSI though.
