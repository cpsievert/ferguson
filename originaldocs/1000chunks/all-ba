GRAND JURY HEARING 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning, everyone. 
3 This is September 16th, 2014, it is about 8:35 a.m. 
4 This is Kathi Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office, 
5 Sheila Whirley is present, as well as all 12 grand 
6 jurors, and the court reporter is present taking 
7 down and recording what is being said. 
8 Some housekeeping notes to start. I'm 
9 going to pass out to you all, you all are going to 
10 receive a copy of a statute. It is section 563.046, 
11 and it is, it says law enforcement officers use of 
12 force in making an arrest. And it is the law on 
13 what is permissible, what force is permissible and 
14 when in making an arrest by a police officer. 
15 I also want to point out to you, I know 
16 you have probably heard or know that there also is a 
17 joint federal investigation that's going on at the 
18 same time. 
19 And several of our witnesses that you are 
20 going to hear from are also being interviewed by FBI 
21 agents or federal agents. And I want you to make 
22 sure you understand the issues that are before you, 
23 may be different than the issues in any federal 
24 investigation. 
25 Their investigation involves civil rights

1 violations. This investigation involves whether 
2 there is criminal liability on the part of the 
3 officer involved in the shooting. 
4 So I can't tell you what the law is on the 
5 civil rights issues, but don't be confused about, 
6 you know, for example, what are the policies of the 
7 police department necessarily doesn't have anything 
8 to do with your decision. You certainly have the 
9 right to know these things if you wish to know these 
10 things, but keep in mind that there is a separate 
11 and distinct investigation going on by the feds 
12 involving civil rights violation or potential civil 
13 rights violation. 
14 The other thing is, I messed up. I'm not 
15 perfect. Sheila will tell you that I'm not, but 
16 we've been marking our exhibits and normally when I 
17 have a trial I have all of my exhibits beforehand 
18 and I mark them all beforehand and I try to be very 
19 meticulous about my numbers. I have kind of been 
20 marking these as I go. This has all been coming in 
21 as we go, so I screwed up on the numbers. So I just 
22 want to clarify for the record in case you are 
23 keeping track of numbers. 
24 Apparently I have two Grand Jury Exhibits 
25 10.

photographs, 
2 he's the crime scene detective that went to the 
3 hospital and photographed Darren Wilson and the 
4 other one is a disc that I played for you that had 
5 Dorian Johnson's recorded statement. 
6 I'm going to keep photograph as 
7 being Number 10 and I am now going to make that disc 
8 of statements, it is going to be Number 17. 
9 And then apparently I have two Number 9s. 
10 One Number 9, I don't know that I have used with you 
11 all yet. I have marked it, and it is a set of 
12 printed photographs that were taken by the morgue 
13 personnel, not the autopsy photos that we saw during 
14 Dr. testimony. These were separate 
15 photos that were taken by the employees at the 
16 Medical Examiner's Office in the morgue that are 
17 different than the autopsy photos. And those are 
18 going to remain Number 9. 
19 The other Number 9 I have was a disc that 
20 had the news clips on it that we showed where Dorian 
21 Johnson had been interviewed or made certain 
22 statements on television programs. And so that disc 
23 is now going to be Number 16. 
24 Unless you all see another issue or 
25 problem, I think right now we have 1 through 17.

1 You might not have seen all of those, but as far as 
2 I know I don't have any duplicates other than that. 
3 So I'll try to be a little more organized 
4 in numbering of the exhibits. 
5 Does anybody see any other issues with 
6 duplicate numbers? 
7 Okay. And then as we told you at the 
8 beginning of every day, we are just going to kind of 
9 give you a preview of what we are going to do. And 
10 so first we're going to listen to a recorded 
11 statement. The person being interviewed is a 
12 sergeant with the Ferguson Police Department, his 
13 name is He was the sergeant on duty 
14 on the date of the shooting and he was Darren 
15 Wilson's direct supervisor. 
16 You will hear his statement. It is about 
17 an hour long. And then following his statement, 
18 Sergeant will be here to testify. 
19 
20 
After that, we will present the testimony 
of Detective , who is a St. Louis County 
21 police detective, regarding an interview that he did 
22 of Darren Wilson. 
23 And then we are going to present the 
24 testimony of

1 And she is an FBI agent and she also 
2 did an interview of Darren Wilson. 
3 Then we will also present a recorded 
4 interview of Darren Wilson for you to listen, that's 
5 about 30 minutes. 
6 And then finally, I anticipate that the 
7 afternoon will have Darren Wilson testifying for you 
8 this afternoon. 
9 The morning is basically going to be 
10 statements that he has made during this 
11 investigation from various people and then he will 
12 be here to testify and answer your questions in the 
13 afternoon, all right? 
14 So with that being said, the next piece of 
15 evidence is a disc that I have marked as Grand Jury 
16 Number 18. 
17 (Deposition Exhibit Number 18 
18 marked for identification.) 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: One of the things that I 
20 will tell you that these discs that contain 
21 statements of various individuals, I mean, you will 
22 hear me use these discs repeatedly because one disc 
23 might have 12 witnesses statements on it. I will 
24 make sure I preface before we begin to play it whose 
25 statement it is.

1 When you put the disc in the computer and 
2 open up the file, it lists the names of everybody 
3 who has made a statement on that disc. They are 
4 pretty recognizable if you would have any need to 
5 listen to a particular statement, it would be easy 
6 to do that. 
7 But there are a number of witness 
8 statements on each of these discs, that's the way we 
9 received them. 
10 Also, we do not have a transcript of this 
11 first statement. I've listened to it and it is 
12 fairly clear. I don't think it should be an issue, 
13 but at any time you all can't hear it or want us to 
14 go back a couple of seconds or 30 seconds or a 
15 minute if you miss something, that's easy enough to 
16 do, all right? 
17 We are going to play for you Grand Juror 
18 Number 18 and it is the recorded statement of 
19 Sergeant 
20 (Statement is being played.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: And as always 21 
22 
23 
And, again, this was Disc Number 18 that 
you heard a recorded statement of It 
24 will be available for you to listen to again at this 
25 time during your investigation.

1 dinner, does everybody that's carrying a 
2 walkie-talkie hear that then? 
3 A Not necessarily. 
Q Do you know why that is? 4 
5 A Well, the walkie-talkies are only 5 watt 
6 transmission power. If they are out in the far 
7 sector or far enough away from a receiver, not 
8 everybody will hear it. Dispatch will hear it 
9 because the receivers will transfer that message to

14 interrupt what you are doing? 
15 A Yes, ma'am. Usually when I'm on the 
16 telephone or I'm trying to get control of a 
17 situation, I may turn the volume down so that they 
18 can hear just me speaking. 
19 Q Okay. But at any rate, you didn't hear 
20 the call that came out if the call came out that 
21 there was something going on or taken place at the 
22 Ferguson Market, is that fair to say? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then while you were on this call, you 
25 did receive a call to respond to the Canfield Green

7 Q And prior to getting that call, had you 
8 heard any transmissions by Officer Wilson? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And so when you got that call, was there a 
11 code with that call that meant respond immediately? 
12 A I was told that I was needed at the 
13 intersection of Canfield and Copper Creek 
14 immediately.

Q 
A 
Q 
Immediately? 
Uh-huh. 
And so did you then finish up what you 
18 were doing or did you leave immediately and respond? 
19 A I turned the scene over to the first 
20 responding officer and I left immediately. 
21 Q So there was, the scene you were at at 
22 that time, there was another police officer also 
23 working that scene? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so you left then immediately and

Yes, ma'am. 
And about how long, how far away were you, 
4 like how many minutes did it take you to get there? 
5 A It took me probably about two, two and a

1 Q So when you were going down Canfield, at 
2 that point you are going east on Canfield? 
3 A Yes.

Were you in a marked police vehicle? 
Yes, ma'am, I was. 
Did you go to the scene with emergency 
11 lights and sirens on? 
12 A I don't recall. I believe the traffic was 
13 relatively sparse at that time, I don't believe it 
14 was needed. 
15 Q Okay. So when you arrived at the scene, 
16 did you see Mr. Darren Wilson's vehicle? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am, I did.

19 it be police officer vehicles or other just civilian 
20 vehicles? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I saw two other police vehicles. 
All right. I guess for, as far as the 
23 police vehicles in Ferguson, we know that Officer 
24 Wilson had a Tahoe? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.

And did you also have a Tahoe? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Are all the police vehicles in Ferguson 
Primarily the entire fleet are Tahoes, but 
6 we also have a secondary fleet of Crown Victorias. 
7 Q So the two police vehicles that you saw 
8 there, besides Officer Wilson, which we've seen 
9 pictures of, were those also marked Tahoes? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So when you got there, you notice Officer 
12 Wilson's vehicle, which direction was it facing in 
13 the street? 
14 A It was kind of catty-corner to the, or 
15 angular to the traffic lane, but it was pointing 
16 more in a westerly direction.

1 Canfield? 
2 A Yes, ma'am, they both were on Canfield. 
3 Both of them were further east than Officer Wilson's 
4 location. 
5 Q And when you arrived at that location, did 
6 you see a body? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And was that, where was that body or where 
9 were those two police vehicles in relation to the 
10 body? 
11 A One police vehicle was beyond the location 
12 of the body parked across the traffic lane to 
13 prevent any vehicle from coming that direction and 
14 the second car was parked off to the right side of 
15 the roadway. 
16 Q So the vehicle that was, I guess, 
17 perpendicular to the street, that would have been 
18 farther east of the body; is that right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And the entire time from the time you got 
21 there until the scene was cleared, did you ever 
22 observe Officer Wilson's vehicle move or be moved, 
23 other than when it was towed away?

A 
Q 
No, ma'am.

15 protect the area where the body was located. 
16 Q Now at this time, and I know you don't

18 officers, obviously, responded prior to your
