Q 
We are talking 15, 20 feet? 
Right. 
Okay. And in your opinion, right before 
15 the officer fired those last shots, well, first let 
16 me ask you this, you said that he was going down and 
17 that's how you think he got the head shot, how did 
18 you know he was shot in the head? 
19 A We went around there, the amount of blood, 
20 excuse me, after they covered him up, they put a 
21 white sheet over his body, white sheet covered his 
22 head. When I went back up there, the sheet had, 
23 this is his head, the sheet extended about this far 
24 out, about 2, 3 three feet this way, about 3 feet 
25 this way. It was completely soaked. Can only come

11 
12 
Q 
A 
Got it. 
Later on when it came out that he was 
13 shot, because when we looked at myself and a few 
14 other people looking at it, they say there was 
15 another older gentlemen standing up there and this 
16 lady oh, my God, he must have been shot, all that 
17 blood. He must have been shot, he must have been 
18 shot in the head, you know. That's when they were 
19 all up over on this side of the street was saying 
20 yeah, he walked up to him, pow.

I'm not in good health. My only 
4 concern is I'm sorry that man got killed, I'm 
5 sorry for his family, but I wasn't going to do 
6 anything that would jeopardize 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A That is my main concern. That's why I'm 
9 out there. 
10 Q And those last shots, in your opinion, the 
11 officer did not have to fire because Michael was 
12 already disabled? 
13 A He was already disabled, yes, in my 
14 opinion he was already disabled because you could 
15 clearly see the man was in distress and was trying 
16 to stay on his feet.

1 you guys were just talking about. So your opinion 
2 right before the last volley of shots, he had lost 
3 control of his body when the yelling stop, stop, 
4 stop, your opinion is that he couldn't stop because 
5 he had lost --
6 A No, he couldn't stop because he was 
7 wobbly, you could see he was trying to stand up. 
8 You could see clearly, we could see he was trying to 
9 stand up. That's when and them were 
10 yelling at him, man, stop, please stop, please stop, 
11 he was trying to stand up. Because the way of the 
12 angle of his body, he was like bent over with his 
13 head up. And you could see almost instantaneously, 
14 you can see him going down. You know, that's why 
15 everyone sitting up there talking about he went down 
16 to his knees he went face first. 
17 I'm going to say it again, 
18 your opinion then is that you felt like he could not 
19 stop? 
20 A No. 
21 He could not control his 
22 body? 
23 A No, he could not control his body, he had 
24 been hit. I don't know how many people in here or 
25 if anyone has, but I know I have. I've been shot.

1 And when that bullet hits you, you don't immediately 
2 feel it. First thing you feel is the heat and when 
3 that heat hits you, everything goes haywire. 
4 He could not stand it okay. 
5 I have 
6 a question. When you and Kathi were talking, she 
7 indicated it was 48 feet and 2 inches from where he 
8 was first shot at the corner to where he was last 
9 shot. When he was last shot and fell to the ground 
10 we determined that it was about 20 feet, you said 20 
11 to 25 feet, we determined 15 to 20, we are going to 
12 split the difference 20 feet, okay. Heated 
13 situation, everybody is crazy. 
14 A Uh-huh. 
15 The officer doesn't know 
16 whether or not he has a weapon and Michael Brown is 
17 still moving forward. 
18 A Yes, he is he is staggering forward. 
19 If it took just a few 
20 seconds for him to travel 48 feet and 2 inches, it 
21 wouldn't take very long for him to travel 20 feet, 
22 right? 
23 A Right. 
24 What do you think the 
25 officer should have done?

1 A After he fired and he was coming 
2 He was coming towards 
3 him, I know you say he was staggering, but the 
4 officer did not know any of these things. 
5 A I don't know their procedures. Okay. 
6 They're saying he's coming, he's probably menacing, 
7 I've heard all kind of things. 
8 You can't really see his 
9 face though, right? 
10 A I cannot see his face, but I can clearly 
11 see his hands were coming down. 
12 You can see like this? 
13 A He was not coming at him in a menacing

1 your statement on the 12th, you said I'm going to 
2 call it or I'm going to say it, I feel like he was 
3 executed. From what you are describing to us, you 
4 know, the police officer saying stop, stop, stop, 
5 and him continuing to move and even moving after 
6 he's injured, urn, do you still feel that way? 
7 A Yes, because I don't believe he had any 
8 weapons on him. 
9 You don't believe --
10 A They didn't find any weapons on him. He 
11 was hit, he was in distress, he was coming at him 
12 and he wasn't coming toward the officer to do any 
13 harm, he was trying to stand on his feet. 
14 And the only direction his body could 
15 move was forward, all right. He knew he hit him, he 
16 know how many shots, but as big as Michael was, I 
17 don't know what's going through his mind. I can't 
18 read his mind, the officer's mind. Maybe he thought 
19 that Michael was coming at him as big as he is, he 
20 could still do some harm to him. 
21 Maybe he did. 
22 A That's why he felt like he had to use 
23 deadly force. I'm seeing someone who is hit, who is 
24 clearly in distress, who cannot stand on his feet, 
25 why?

1 Again, I'm going to go 
2 back to what you just said. I just have to know, 
3 this is very important. You said you don't know 
4 what's going through the officer's mind, maybe he 
5 did think he was in distress, you just said that, 
6 right? 
7 A Yeah. 
8 He didn't know whether or 
9 not 
10 A He could see that he was in distress. 
11 But he didn't know 
12 whether he was in danger? 
13 A He didn't know whether he was coming. He 
14 may have assumed that hey, I got this 6'5", 290 
15 pound guy and I already put four bullets in him and 
16 he is still coming. 
17 And he's still moving 
18 toward him? 
19 A And he's still moving. But he should have 
20 clear sight to see that this man was in distress. 
21 He could see that he could not, barely stand on his 
22 feet. But to take to fire four more rounds was 
23 excessive in my opinion, okay.

1 said when the officer exited the vehicle after the 
2 first shot is fired what, in your mind, how, can you 
3 picture how many seconds it took, he came out, you 
4 say, did he come out already, drawn his weapon? 
5 A I can't see him from the driver's side. 
6 As he was coming around, you could see the gun in 
7 his hand. By the time he got to the back bumper of 
8 his truck, it was in this position. He had already 
9 unholstered, he had to cause by the time he got to 
10 the back of the truck, it was coming up and he got 
11 in that stance quick. (indicating)

13 been in his vision in order to not see Mr. Brown,

18 going that way, but he came around to the back of 
19 the truck. 
20 Right. 
21 A To get a line of sight on him. So he had 
22 for a split second to come around, but as he's 
23 coming round, he could see through his windows. He 
24 could look through the windows of the truck to see 
25 where he is, okay. But when he came around to the

11 The officer, even though 
12 he came around his vehicle, did he ever come at an 
13 angle closer because I think I believe I read in 
14 your testimony on August the 12th that you said that 
15 he had set at angle, like catty-corner

18 wasn't like this, he stood like this. (indicating)

The guy that was with him? 
A Oh, I didn't know his name. I never knew 
3 his name. No, huh-uh. Once Michael hit that side, 
4 we looked back, I didn't know where he went. We 
5 assumed, excuse me, that this is the building, we 
6 thought he had ran around to the side of the 
7 building over here, but in his statements on the 
8 news he was behind one of the police trucks. We 
9 didn't see that. 
10 I mean, he is a little guy, truck is 
11 kind of high, all right. My eyesight was on 
12 Michael, for some odd reason we are glued to him, 
13 okay. Because as the officer was coming around, we 
14 figure that something happened between Mike, we knew 
15 Michael was at the truck, we was watching them two. 
16 Him, we didn't see him, he 
17 disappeared. He was a little guy, he was gone.

During the shooting?

10 cars from everywhere was coming, you know. But 
11 before they, as they were coming, it was the crowd 
12 of people were coming from everywhere. From up here 
13 at Ellison, this is the first street. From there, 
14 from all parts of the complex and from Northwinds 
15 they are running up there.

8 like this, and he started looking at his body. 
9 Can you clarify at what 
10 point you actually saw that? 
11 A As he turned, and he you could see as he 
12 is coming around, he's spinning around, looked like 
13 we saw something that was on his hand cause he kept 
14 doing like this. He kept looking at hit and then he 
15 looked down, he looked at both sides of his body. 
16 So I'm guessing he may have touched 
17 hisself to see if there was blood or something cause 
18 you could see there was splotches cause he's real 
19 dark and then he turned around and he did that, 
20 looked up. And as he spun around, and then he says 
21 that's it, boom. When he turned around, he had his 
22 hands facing the officer, we couldn't see the palms. 
23 Okay. It was before the 
24 first volley of shots? 
25 A Before the first volley.

3 2:07 p.m. on September 30th. We are in the grand 
4 jury, present is myself, Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila 
5 Whirley, as well as all 12 grand jurors and the 
6 court reporter, and we have just gotten back from 
7 our lunch break. 
8 I do have two officers who I believe are 
9 going to testify this afternoon. One is going to be 
10 Detective He's the officer who is 
11 the primary case officer investigating this matter. 
12 I'm only going, we're not going to get into the 
13 entire investigation. I'm simply calling him to ask 
14 him some questions about the interview that he had 
15 with 
16 And then after that, we will have 
17 If you recall he was the crime scene 
18 investigator who went to the Ferguson Police 
19 Department, and then followed them to the hospital 
20 and actually took pictures of Officer Wilson and 
21 then he will testify about seizing other items 
22 because we had to interrupt him to get Dr. 
23 on, if you recall. Hopefully he will just be like 
24 another 30 minutes. 
25 Neither of them are here yet, I assume

9 employee of that she actually was 
10 going to pick up. I'm first playing clip one. 
11 As usual, I'm not going to play the clip 
12 in its entirety, a lot of these contain comments by 
13 the reporter and stuff. I'm starting this at 55 
14 seconds and I will play it to a minute and 15 
15 seconds, so this isn't long at all. 
16 
17 
(Clip is being played at this time.)

19 anybody need to see that again? I'll start it again 
20 because I didn't have the volume up. 
21 Can you freeze 
22 it too? I'd like to see the view that she had from 
23 her balcony a little better.

9 in the background, those two places. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, I will do my best. 
11 (Clip is being played at this time.) 
12 Right there, other time 
13 he used the zoom it looked like. 
14 No, that's not his 
15 apartment building that we just heard, right? 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, if you notice in the 
17 street and it is easier to see on the screen that 
18 there are some items in the street. It tells you it 
19 looks like a couple of those traffic cones and then 
20 a looks like a crucifix, and I can't tell what that 
21 black thing is. 
22 Looks like a statute.
