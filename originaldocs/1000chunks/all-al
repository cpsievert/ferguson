2 MS. ALIZADEH: Good afternoon. For the 
3 record, I'm Kathi Alizadeh with the Prosecutor's 
4 Office. Also present is Sheila Whirley with the 
5 Prosecutor's Office, and all 12 jurors are present 
6 today and as well as the court reporter who is 
7 taking down everything that's being said as well as 
8 audio recording the proceedings that are going on 
9 this afternoon. 
10 As you can tell, we've kind of rearranged. 
11 We're trying to figure out how to best work the room 
12 with the equipment that we have. 
13 As you can see this screen kind of moves. 
14 Do you see the wind, the air blowing on it? It is 
15 blowing on the screen, but not on you, 
16 unfortunately. So we're going to try this out. 
17 If this is too annoying, we'll next time 
18 try something else out, but this is a bigger screen 
19 and we thought maybe it would be easier for 
20 everybody to see it. If everybody gets car sick 
21 because pictures are kind of wiggling on there, we 
22 will figure something out. 
23 Also, and we have some additional fans, 
24 I'm going to try to bring another fan in tomorrow to 
25 make it a little more comfortable. I'm doing the

1 best I can as far as the heating and cooling. 
2 So my understanding that you all are going 
3 to be able to be seated today from 1:00 to 5:00; is 
4 that correct? And so for today we've scheduled two 
5 witnesses. The first witness is here and it will be 
6 another crime scene detective. 
7 His name is Detective 
8 And then the second witness that's 
9 going to testify is the medical examiner who 
10 conducted the autopsy, his name is Dr. and 
11 because of his schedule, I'm going to tell 
12 Dr. probably isn't going to be here until 
13 two, he's going to get here as soon as he can. 
14 If we're not done with Detective 
15 we are just going to interrupt his testimony because 
16 he can very easily come back on another day. It is 
17 hard for me to get the doctor here. He is going to 
18 be going out of town, so we might have to interrupt 
19 Detective and bring him back to finish up 
20 with whatever questions or additional we have with 
21 him, okay? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
So with that being said.

9 Q Can you start out by stating your name and 
10 spelling it so the court reporter can put it in the 
11 record?

Q And how are you employed? 
A I'm a police officer. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
Q How long have you been a police officer? 
A 33 years. 
Q Okay. Now, Detective you are kind 
18 of a soft spoken person a little bit. I want to 
19 make sure that everybody back here can hear him and 
20 if you cannot hear him, please raise your hand and 
21 let us know if you can't hear him. 
22 I don't think the microphone 
23 amplifies, it is recording actually. So you 
24 probably just have to keep your voice up a little 
25 bit.

Q Now, we've already heard from a Detective 9 
10 about what crime scene detectives do. Would 
11 that be similar to what you do with your job 
12 responsibilities? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are you a training officer for crime scene 
15 detectives? 
16 A Yes, both in division patrol and also the 
17 crime scene unit. For the past 27 years, I've been 
18 a field training instructor. 
19 I also teach the basic and advance 
20 crime scene schools at our police academy and I also 
21 lecture at four area schools and universities. 
22 Q And is there a board certification for 
23 crime scene investigators?

2 Board Certified Senior Crime Scene Analyst. 
3 Q Were you working then as a crime scene 
4 investigator for St. Louis County on August 9th of 
5 this year? 
6 A I was. 
7 Q And did you receive a call sometime in the 
8 early afternoon of that day to respond regarding a 
9 police involved shooting? 
A I did. 
Q About what time did you get that call? 
10 
11 
12 A Uh, about 1:00 p.m. I was notified at home 
13 by my supervisor to respond to our office, which is 
14 in north county, to retrieve a crime scene van and 
15 then contact one of our crimes against person 
16 detectives at Christian Northwest Hospital. 
17 Q So did you go from your home to the office 
18 to pick up a crime scene van? 
19 
20

Q 
I did. 
Now, we've also heard Detective

And then after retrieving the crime scene

8 
9 
A 
Q 
I did, I arrived about 2:20p.m. 
And did you make contact with a detective, 
10 now you say crimes against person, are you all 
11 familiar with the bureau in St. Louis County? The 
12 detective bureau is divided up into separate 
13 distinct units, crimes against persons is a unit 
14 that deals with, obviously, crimes against persons, 
15 but it would be homicides, assaults, rapes and so 
16 forth. 
17 So Detective when you got to 
18 the hospital, who did you contact? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
One of our detectives by the name of 
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson was 
23 there, the assist chief of Ferguson Police 
24 Department and an attorney for the paternal order of 
25 police for Mr. Wilson.

4 A Based on the information that I received, 
5 I was to document visible injuries or complaint 
6 sites of injury on Darren Wilson. We were to 
7 document his clothing. I was going to seize his 
8 clothing and also the weapon that he carried that 
9 day. 
10 At some point in time I was also 
11 tasked with the processing of the Ferguson police 
12 vehicle, which was a fully marked Tahoe.

1 A I asked him what areas hurt other than 
2 what I was seeing. He went through several sites 
3 that he complained of injuries. I retrieved the ER 
4 charge nurse to make sure that I wasn't missing 
5 anything as far as the ER staff doing their initial 
6 assessment of Darren Wilson. 
7 Q So you spoke with the charge nurse, do you 
8 recall his name? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No, I do not. 
Did he indicate to you that there were 
11 additional injuries that you did not assess or not 
12 see? 
13 A No, we walked through with Darren Wilson 
14 his injury complaint sites, consisting of mainly his 
15 facial area, the back of his neck and he said his 
16 head hurt. 
17 Q Did you photograph the areas that he 
18 indicated hurt? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
I did. 
Now, we also heard Detective 
21 yesterday, not yesterday, I keep saying yesterday, 
22 previously, about when he photographs crime scenes, 
23 are you all instructed similarly that you would 
24 have, I guess, a procedure that you follow in how 
25 you do photographs?

1 A Correct. There's a standard format that 
2 we teach in the crime scene school and we also teach 
3 during our field training program. 
4 There's a normal sequencing event. In 
5 this case you take overall pictures, you take what's 
6 called midrange pictures to tie in that location to 
7 something else that's recognizable, you will take a 
8 specific image and in these kind of circumstances 
9 you'll also put a measuring device or a scale in 
10 your information to give you an idea of how large 
11 this area is or how small this area is. 
12 Q Did you do that when you were 
13 photographing the injuries on Darren Wilson? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And then after you completed all of your 
16 investigation in this case, did you remove the 
17 memory card from your camera? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And did you have those, I can't remember, 
20 do you burn it onto a desk or do you take the memory 
21 card to the lab? 
22 A No, the memory card is placed in, in the 
23 old days referred to as a film envelope, and then 
24 that was hand carried by myself to our photo lab. 
25 The photo lab will download the original images from

1 the media card onto a disc and then after that's 
2 completed, on homicide cases, officer involved 
3 shootings and other cases of note, they will print 
4 the photo lab, meaning they, will print 8 X 10 
5 photographs. This was done in this case. 
6 I will respond back to the photo lab, 
7 those images are reviewed my me and then they are 
8 stamped with official photographs and for the

Q 
A 
Q 
All right. Did you do that in this case? 
I did. 
When you examined the photographs after 
15 the lab had printed them out, did the lab print each 
16 and every image that you had snapped during your 
17 investigation? 
18 
19

So there is no images that you deleted

10 what I have marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 10. Did 
11 you and I get this envelope yesterday, did you 
12 recognize this from my office yesterday? 
13 A We did. When I stamp these photographs, I 
14 fill out the front of this with a header information 
15 as far as date, complaint number, what type of 
16 incident it is, and in this scenario since I went to 
17 three different locations, those three different 
18 locations are also marked on front of the envelope. 
19 In addition to that, I put my 
20 information on there as far as crime scene unit, 
21 Detective my DSN. 
22 We also stamp in front, which matches 
23 what's on the back of the photographs so it is 
24 marked official photograph. And as far as the 
25 dissemination, in this case this was marked PA,

3 photographs that are inside Grand Jury Exhibit 10. 
4 And just briefly leaf through them. Do those appear 
5 to be the photographs that you took during your 
6 investigation of this case? 
7 A They are.

10 photograph and you circle the image number and place 
11 your initials there?

17 hand there? 
A Yes, ma'am. 18

20 to sit in that chair right there, and I will have 
21 you one by one we're going to go through each 
22 photograph and you are going to describe what is 
23 depicted in that photograph. So this is Image 
24 Number 1, correct?

Q 
Every time, yes, ma'am. 
And that contains the date that the

7 incident always or the date that the photographs are 
8 being taken? 
9 A Usually both. If I respond to a scene to 
10 photograph that, if it is the original scene, at 
11 this point it was, then the original date here. 
12 Now, if I had been involved in this 
13 with further investigation, if I have another aspect 
14 of this investigation, I will put in parentheses
