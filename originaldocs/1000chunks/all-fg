22 or any part of his head over the roof of the car?

1 Q That is the correct answer if you are not 
2 sure, okay? 
3 A Yeah, I'm not sure. 
4 Q And so you said you saw the officer's arm 
5 come out of the window and grab him by the shirt 
6 collar. Let me ask you this. If the vehicle is in 
7 between Michael Brown and you, are you looking 
8 through the vehicle to see that? 
A Yes. 9 
10 Q Okay. So is the passenger window of the 
11 vehicle open? 
A Yes. 12 
13 Q You remember the passenger window was 
14 down, and obviously, if the officer puts his hand 
15 through the driver's side window, we know that 
16 window was down? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Okay. So you're saying that you could see 
19 through those windows, and you saw the officer grab 
20 Michael Brown by the shirt collar? 
A Yes, ma'am. 21 
22 Q Okay. So you're actually looking into the 
23 car, if you are seeing through those windows, you 
24 have to see into the car, right?

1 Q And then you would see the front portion 
2 of Michael Brown's body? 
3 A Yeah. 
4 Q And so if Michael Brown, I mean, if his 
5 hands were up, at or near or inside that vehicle --
6 A His hands were not in the vehicle at all. 
7 Q Okay. Do you remember saying before that 
8 you couldn't really see either of their hands as far

Q

I know when he grabbed him by his shirt. 
Right. 
I seen him when he went to go and like 
13 knock his hands back. And that's when the first 
14 shot was fired. 
15 Q Well, you've said in your other statement 
16 that when you talk about the officer putting his 
17 hand out of the car, you say he pulled out and 
18 grabbed him. This is difficult for me to do because 
19 you guys talk over each other in these statements 
20 and so I'm going to do my best and I'm going to show 
21 you this so it will be easier for you to follow 
22 along.

13 evidently, that you were guessing at that? 
14 A No, I was saying, what I was saying was 
15 that evidently he had to have his hand on the gun in

No, ma'am. 
And so would it be safe to say that if the 
3 officer had his gun in his hand, and if Michael 
4 Brown had his hand on the officer's gun, you 
5 couldn't see that either, is that fair to say? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. Now, you testified today that when 
8 Michael Brown turned around and he had his hands up, 
9 I don't want to frustrate you, do you want some 
10 water or anything? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
I'm fine. 
And when he turns around with his hands up 
13 you said that, I'm not sure how sure you were to 
14 date on this because you said I think so and then 
15 you said yes. You said that you heard Mike Brown 
16 say, I give up. 
17 A He did. 
18 Q And then you also said you never heard the 
19 officer saying anything? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
He didn't. 
Okay. And I'm going to ask you again in

23 August 16th, this happened on August 16th, would 
24 have been the next Saturday when you are talking to

1 you're and this is the special agent. And 
2 you say, and that's when he turned around and he was 
3 going back toward the police, defend, to give up. 
4 And the officer asked, could you hear what was being 
5 said. 
6 And then another officer said do, and 
7 then you said, no, I could not but I --
8 And then the agent says, can't hear 
9 anybody yelling back and --
10 
11 
A 
Q 
I said no. 
And you said no. Back on the 16th you 
12 didn't hear anybody say anything? 
13 A No. Like I said, when the first shot went 
14 off, I know I heard him turn around and say, I give 
15 up. Now, as far as him, I say him defending 
16 himself, I meant to say he was surrendering himself. 
17 Q Okay. I'm sorry, I started before you 
18 finished. 
19 A No, I was just saying that he was going 
20 back to surrender himself. Like I say when he went 
21 back and he turned around, his hands was up.

1 Sheila that you didn't mean --
2 A Right, I really didn't mean to say defend 
3 hisself. 
4 Q My question has to do with the fact that 
5 today you testified that you heard Michael Brown say 
6 I give up? 
7 A He did say I give up. 
8 Q But back on the 16th, a week after this 
9 happened, you said you didn't hear either of them

1 were in the wrong place at the wrong time. And 
2 there were a lot of people that wish they weren't

2 shooting as he was walking towards him. And as he 
3 was walking towards the guy, he fell down and the

5 walked over to him and stood over him, no, he

5 clarification. When you talked about you were asked 
6 that you wanted to help Michael Brown's family, I

8 How do you want to help them, I'm not clear on that? 
9 A As far as bringing, bringing the truth out 
10 of what really happened. I mean, I didn't feel like 
11 he did anything wrong. He didn't make no --

3 So, I mean, for the police to assault 
4 him or do anything, what was the reason?

I 
7 sympathize with your loss, sorry. I understood what 
8 you just told Miss Sheila, let me understand your

10 not justified to you?

12 Regardless, you didn't 
13 know what happened beforehand because like you say, 
14 you just saw the tussling and after that? 
15 A Right. 
16 But as far as him being 
17 dead on the ground. 
18 A Okay. What I'm saying is, if he did 
19 something wrong, and the police had to protect 
20 itself or to defend itself, then that would have 
21 been the case, but for this young man to be walking 
22 down the street, not causing any problems to no one 
23 that was outside, what was the point. You could 
24 have tased him instead of shoot him.

1 in some type of way, you could have tased him. You 
2 didn't have to pull your gun first. He didn't go to 
3 show that he had any weapon on him at all. 
4 So I felt like for him shooting him, 
5 it was just too much. You could have tased him. If 
6 anybody else run up and have an incident with a 
7 police officer, that would be the first thing a 
8 police officer will do to defend themself. If you 
9 felt like he had a weapon or anything. 
10 He didn't show that he had any weapon 
11 at all. He was just walking down the street and him 
12 and his friend having a casual conversation, that's 
13 what I saw out of them, so. 
14 For him to just shoot that young man

21 It is some hard issues that are being brought up by 
22 this, that's what we are charged to do. We have to 
23 know the truth.

1 proper decision, okay? 
A Uh-huh. 2 
3 Sometimes it might be hard 
4 on you, it is with love, with love behind it, okay? 
5 I have a question here. You said that, I 
6 think this is on page 17 of your statement from what 
7 is this, August 16th, at the top. When you're 
8 saying that the officer backs up and then you know 
9 Mike Brown is at the driver's side window, your view 
10 is from the passenger side? 
11 A Yes, ma'am. 
12 I think we've already 
13 established the amount you can see. 
14 A Uh-huh. 
15 You have a SUV with tinted 
16 windows, Mike is between, his body is between you 
17 and the SUV, then you have a cop in the car as well 
18 and then Dorian also to the right side? 
19 
20 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Of the vehicle. Okay. 
21 You said you heard the first shot, am right about 
22 that? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. 
24 So if we can't see, you 
25 know, hands going off or whatever, and I pose a

1 question, is it a possibility that the first shot 
2 may have been an accidental shot and it was not a 
3 shot intentionally to injure Mr. Brown? 
4 A It could have been, but that doesn't count 
5 for the rest of the shots that came after that when 
6 he turned around. If that was a warning shot, the 
7 rest of the shots, them or five or six shots 
8 shouldn't have came from behind the first shot that 
9 went off. 
10 Uh-huh. 
11 A I don't feel like it was a warning, I feel 
12 like it was intentionally done because the police 
13 could have been intimated. Like I say, I didn't 
14 know he was a teenager, I thought he was a grown man 
15 when I seen him. 
16 So the police probably was 
17 intimidated of his height, his weight, I don't know, 
18 but I don't feel like it could have been a warning 
19 shot. 
20 But even if that was a 
21 warning shot, that would be an intentional act by 
22 the officer, okay? 
23 A Okay. 
24 So in the realm of 
25 everything, there's a possibility just like the

1 first shot might have been an accident; is that 
2 correct? 
3 A It could have been yes, ma'am. 
4 As you mentioned 
5 again, standing out there, a nice day on a Saturday, 
6 talking with a couple people by the dumpster. A lot 
7 of stuff going on as you mentioned out there. Was 
8 it the act of the police car driving by that drew 
9 your attention to then watch the entire scene, or 
10 was it the first gunshot that had a big conversation 
11 or smoke that drew your attention, what was it that 
12 really made you focus solely on --
13 A What made me focused is when they pulled 
14 back towards them. 
15 Okay. 
16 A What could they do. They was walking 
17 across the street, they couldn't have been doing too 
18 much, they wasn't doing anything. 
19 There wasn't any sound 
20 associated with it, okay. Okay, thank you. 
21 I have a couple 
22 questions. 
23 A Uh-huh. 
24 And I want you to know 
25 that these questions are hard for me to ask you,

1 okay? 
A That's fine. 2 
3 I just want to verify on 
4 page 29 of your statement, you said that, just now, 
5 that was what I was going to ask you, You 
6 said the gunshot is what made me look for real? 
7 A Yeah. 
8 We've established you 
9 were looking through a car window that was tinted, 
10 past one officer to another officer from the 
11 opposite side of the street, and you really weren't 
12 paying attention until you actually heard that first 
13 gunshot, okay? 
14 A Uh-huh. 
15 We've already established 
16 that could have been an accident on either person's 
17 side. The officer or Michael, they could have been 
18 tussling. You didn't see his head, so you don't 
19 know if he was in the car, right? 
20 A No. 
21 You couldn't see the top 
22 of his head? 
23 A No. 
24 You have stated that he 
25 was not in the car?

1 A He was not in the car at all. 
2 So, and then we also 
3 established when you said the officer stood up over 
4 him and emptied, and you didn't finish that, but 
5 that's what it felt like to you, right? 
6 A Yeah. 
7 He did not do that? 
8 A No, he did not literally stand over him, 
9 no. 
10 I just have a question 
for you about Was she outside with you 11 
12 
13 
from the very beginning when the police car stopped? 
A No. 
14 Because you 
the first thing that you saw. 15 
16 A No, she probably came outside 
17 pulled up, so.

right when I 
18 Okay. So again, when did 
19 you pull up? 
20 
21 
A I can't remember, it was afternoon. 
I mean, did you pull up, 
22 I'm just trying to determine if you and 
23 see the whole altercation? 
24 A No, she probably did see the whole 
25 altercation, I'm not going to say she did or not. I

1 know what I saw. 
2 And so you were visiting 
3 a friend, you were going to stop by? 
4 A Yeah, I just want to stop by and visit a 
5 friend. 
6 And you realized he was 
7 home? 
8 A Right. 
9 Did you get of your car 
10 and go to his door and knock? 
A Yes, I did. 11 
12 
13 
After you got done, did 
you see on his balcony? 
14 A He was on his balcony and I was walking 
15 like back towards my car, where the car was. And I 
16 asked him for a cigarette and he threw it down and 
17 that's when I saw 
18 Outside? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. 
20 And then today before you 
21 said you heard him as he's walking away, Michael 
22 Brown walking toward the police officer with his 
23 hands up, you heard him say, I give up? 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I give up. 
Then today you said, urn,

1 let me find my notes. That you heard him say I give 
2 up after the first shot? 
3 A Yeah, no, no, when he walk, when he come 
4 back, when he was running towards, he didn't say 
5 when he turned around, when he noticed, I guess, 
6 when he was shot, when he turned back around to walk 
7 back towards the police, he was giving up. He was 
8 surrendering hisself. 
9 I have a question for you 
10 
11 
about that. I'm not saying he wasn't truly giving 
up. If you were in the same situation and you were 
12 giving up, would you continue to walk toward the 
13 police officer or would you stop and get down? 
14 A I probably would have stopped and got 
15 down. 
16 So if you're telling me 
17 that you would have stopped and got down, and the 
18 reasonable thing would be to stop and get down. And 
19 a 6'5", 285 pound man, even though he may have his 
20 hands like this coming towards you, do you think 
21 it's possible the police officer could have 
misunderstood his act of surrender? (indicating) 22 
23 A He probably could have misunderstood, but 
24 that still didn't give him no reason cause he still 
25 didn't ever move his hands from out of the air. I

1 could see if he walked, and then dropped his hands 
2 and started back towards the police. And then I 
3 could see some sort of, I need to defend myself. I 
4 don't know what is going to happen, but when he was 
5 going back towards the police, he had his hands up. 
6 But he always was walking
