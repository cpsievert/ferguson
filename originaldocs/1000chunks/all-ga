Are those the calls that you pulled that I 
Yes.

(By Ms. Alizadeh) And then did I, did you 
7 also provide for me a print-out that I've marked 
8 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 71, that shows the dates 
9 and times of those calls? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. So the first call that is 
12 recorded on Grand Jury 60 is a call from August 9th 
13 at 11:43, 11:00 a.m., I'm sorry, let me back up. 
14 11:43 and 15 seconds in the a.m.? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
All right. And then the record, which is 
17 Grand Jury Exhibit 71, date and time stamps it and 
18 says how long the call lasts; is that correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And now the next column says caller 
21 number, but there is nothing in there? 
22 A Correct. That would show like if it was a 
23 911 call, would show the number that came in. 
24 Q Okay. And then for the column that says 
25 channel name, it is all of those are RIOT A calls?

Q 
Page 208 
Correct. 
Okay. And then what is the, the next 
3 column says location, what does that mean? 
4 A That's the DVD that it's on. For 
5 instance, 549, that's the 549th CD we have stuck in 
6 there to record. 
7 Q So these calls are not maintained on a 
8 hard drive someplace? 
9 A They are for about probably three weeks 
10 and then they are archived to this. 
11 Q So regardless of whether I ask for these, 
12 I could get calls from a year ago, correct? 
13 A We keep them that long, yeah. 
14 Q So when you got these calls for me it was 
15 more than three weeks past August 9th, is that fair 
16 to say? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And so that location means you were able 
19 to determine what DVD it was on? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
22 records. 
Exactly. 
Okay. And I'm going to pass out these 
23 So the first call that was reported, 
24 I already mentioned, is at 11:43 and 15 seconds in 
25 the a.m. And then the last call recorded is at 2:06

1 and 31 minutes, I'm sorry, 2:06 and 31 seconds in 
2 the p.m., correct? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q I mean, that's more than a ten-minute 
5 increment? 
6 A Right. 
7 Q You get these? 
8 A What I was doing was trying to show when 
9 it ended and when it started and any traffic in 
10 between. 
11 Q Okay. Now, are you aware that the 
12 incident at the St. Anthony's hospice facility, did 
13 that start before 11:43:15 a.m.? 
14 A Way before it, yes. 
15 Q So were you aware then that the county had 
16 already notified their officers to, that were 
17 involved in that incident, to switch over to RIOT A? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And so that transmission is not included 
20 in what you've gotten me, right? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No. 
And then down here you have a reference on 
23 August 9th, 2014 at 12:35:35 p.m., St. Anthony

A I just came up with it because at that 
point on the tape or the CD is when they secured 
channel. In other words, we're done. 
Q So there is actually an audio recording 
an officer's voice, we are clearing the RIOT A 
channel. In other words, the incident has ended, 
9 you can tune back to dispatch or whatever? 
A Correct.

of 
10 
11 Q Okay. And then you also indicate at about 
12 2:00p.m. and 26 seconds on the same day, it says 
13 RIOT A for Ferguson, and again, that was, you 
14 determined, that is your phrase? 
15 A That is my phrase from what was said on 
16 the audio. 
17 Q Okay. So there's an audio of an officer 
18 activating the RIOT A channel because of the 
19 Ferguson incident? 
A Correct.

Is there a call for officer in need of 
Not that I heard. 
Is there a call that says something like 
10 send every car you've got? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Never heard that. 
All right. And now I've listened to the 
13 calls also and I asked you out there, there's some 
14 of these calls actually is a series of tones and 
15 there's nobody speaking? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q Why are those calls, what is that? 
18 A That's an FCC regulation where each 
19 channel has a frequency and you have to either 
20 broadcast yourself, the call signal over it, and for 
21 instance, normal everyday traffic, you'd say KWA 
22 519, that's our call signal. On a channel that's 
23 not used very often, it is an automatic identifier 
24 that goes out, it is a tone. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
So that's an FCC requirement?

Yes. 
And that is a tone that's just generated 
3 automatically? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q It doesn't have any kind of meaning as far 
6 as any incident happening, correct? 
7 A No, correct. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any more 
9 questions. My questions for you, jurors, is do you 
10 want to hear these calls? They're not very long. 
11 Obviously, some of them are five seconds in 
12 duration, six seconds, 14 seconds. We could listen 
13 to all of them in a matter of less than ten minutes. 
14 Of course, this would be available if you all want 
15 to listen to it yourself at a later date, but that's 
16 up to you. Do you have an interest in hearing these 
17 calls? 
18 
19 Q 
MS. WHIRLEY: I had a question for 
(By Ms. Whirley) This RIOT A for Ferguson, 
20 these are not Ferguson's communications to their own 
21 communication system, this is them on county's 
22 communication system? 
23 A I'd have to hear it, but I believe it was 
24 county activating the RIOT channel. Normally most 
25 of your municipalities that are going to use it at

1 the very beginning you can hear a couple people just 
2 talking. They don't identify themselves. I can 
3 recognize one of the names. It was a guy in the St. 
4 Anthony's. They'll use it, they'll use that channel 
5 just, hey, meet me over at McDonald's or something, 
6 they will talk car to car kind of thing. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A But usually an activation is done by the 
9 county. 
10 Q And I'm sure it was said already, just to 
11 make sure I'm clear. A municipality like Ferguson 
12 can access that RIOT A channel and talk to other 
13 officers and other departments? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Okay. But it is really a channel that is 
16 maintained by County? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q All right. On this channel, all of these 
19 other calls, like the St. Anthony's secure and the 
20 calls previous to that, all dealt with something 
21 that was happening at St. Anthony's? 
A You can tell one of the cars, you could 22 
23 hear a guy say , he is on the SWAT team. 
24 Q But they are not like communications where 
25 they are calling into dispatch and announcing their

1 location or their arrival, or asking for assistance 
2 or anything like that, it is just sort of an 
3 informal communication amongst officers on this 
4 channel? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And just to clarify, 
7 because Sheila asked you, officers in municipalities 
8 can use this to talk to each other, but the other 
9 person has to be monitoring the RIOT A channel? 
10 
11 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So it is not like if 
12 someone transmits something on a RIOT A, it is not 
13 suddenly everybody switches over to RIOT A because 
14 there was transmission? 
15 A No, you usually have a few, the smaller 
16 municipalities, they'll know. Let's say I'm 
17 Dellwood and you're something else, Bellefontaine. 
18 We know, hey, monitor this channel and I will call 
19 you when I need you, not call when I need you. I 
20 will just talk to you whenever I want you to 
21 monitor. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: We also heard some 
23 testimony, you know ; is that right? 
24 A Yes.

1 me up with him so he could explain how radio traffic 
2 works, right? 
3 A Yeah. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: And so we heard him testify 
5 about that emergency button or the orange button 
6 that was on the walkie-talkie. And he said that no 
7 matter what channel an officer is on, when that 
8 button is pressed, it automatically switches, it 
9 automatically goes to the dispatch channel for that 
10 officer's department. 
11 Now my question to you is, if that button 
12 is pressed by an officer in a municipality who is 
13 not on RIOT A, but might be on another channel, 
14 would you hear it on RIOT A? 
A No. 15 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: If that button is pressed 
17 while the officer is on RIOT A, because 
18 testified about how that tone, the data bursts that 
19 are sent out when that button is pressed, are going 
20 to go through, they are going to override everything 
21 else? 
22 
23 
A Uh-huh. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So if that button is 
24 pressed when the radio is on the RIOT A channel, 
25 whatever channel that might be for the municipality,

1 would you hear it on the, would you be able to hear 
2 it on the RIOT A monitoring, when you are monitoring 
3 RIOT A? 
4 A Well, County is different. I think the 
5 way described it is Ferguson does automatic, is 
6 programmed to automatically, no matter what channel 
7 I'm on, if I press it, it is going back to the 
8 Ferguson main. So, no, we never hear it. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: It is not going back to 
10 County, just Ferguson? 
11 
12 
A 
13 question. 
Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I know you had a 
14 GRAND JUROR 12: It shows the RIOT A for 
15 Ferguson started at 2:00. I know you were asking 
16 questions about you hear anybody asking for help, 
17 but this would have been, they would have secured 
18 this channel after the incident happened, correct? 
19 A They didn't secure it, they started it up. 
20 They started the RIOT 
21 channel after the initial incident --
22 
23 
A Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: These are officers talking 
24 informally amongst each other?

1 officer asking dispatcher for help, this is officers 
2 talking to each other about the aftermath of. 
3 A No, when St. Anthony secured, we shut down 
4 the RIOT channel. There is nobody sitting there 
5 monitoring, listening, we shut it down. Ferguson 
6 happens, all of the phone calls made. 
7 You said Ferguson

The incident at Ferguson. 
The incident happened. 
That was around noon-ish. So that happens 
12 and all the phone calls are made and then the 
13 decision, commander decides let's move everything 
14 over to the RIOT channel. 
15 So my question, just so I 
16 get everything, this is not, this is not going to 
17 tell us whether Officer Wilson called in for help or 
18 anything, this is just going to tell us that after 
19 the fact they secured this channel for what they 
20 needed?

22 RIOT channel.

1 dispatcher, it would not be on here? 
2 A No, this is strictly St. Louis County. 
3 They started using this 
4 channel after the incident? 
5 A After the incident, code 2000 they call 
6 it, and they activated the RIOT channel. 
7 They activated the RIOT 
8 channel to assist with the aftermath of what 
9 happened? 
10 
11 
A Yeah. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Again, just to be clear, if 
12 for the sake of assumption, if Officer Wilson had 
13 broadcast or had transmitted something on the RIOT 
14 channel, it may have been received and recorded, 
15 correct? 
16 A Correct. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: But we've already heard 
18 from that there are these voting recorders 
19 or receivers and they selected a transmission that's 
20 best quality and so it might get, might not have 
21 been received? 
22 
23 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. On your report,

1 indicate that there was no transmission between that 
2 time period? 
3 A No, say that again, though, you say --
4 MS. WHIRLEY: 11:52 and 12:04 on the RIOT 
5 channel, was there any transmission? Because it 
6 looks like the duration of 11:52, was that six 
7 seconds? 
8 A Yeah, okay, it picked up something at 
9 11:52 for six seconds. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Right. So after that six 
11 seconds was over, is there nothing else that was 
12 picked up until 12:04? 
13 A Correct. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: So if someone was on the 
15 RIOT channel, that would have been recorded?

MS. WHIRLEY: Between that time period? 
Yeah. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Between 11:52 and 12:04, if 
20 there was nobody else transmitting. 
21 A Yeah, any kind of break in time in there, 
22 there's no audio to record it.

A For the RIOT channel? 
Just distance.

10 
11 A There are different frequencies or 
12 different towers. So, for instance, I can speak for 
13 the county. The county's tower is at Seven Hills 
14 and Halls Ferry. So that's where our RIOT receiver 
15 would be.

18 town their frequency, no clue. 
19 I think we were told it 
20 was in the back of the police?

9 If like the line of sight 
10 wasn't available, even if he would have been on 
11 Ferguson, which he may or may not have been, could 
12 it have still been picked up, for lack of a better 
13 term, a dead zone? 
14 A We have a lot of those, believe it or not, 
15 throughout the whole county. That's part of the new 
16 radio system we're building.

18 A Correct all of those issues. 
19 Earlier 
20 you said something about a 911 call, if there would

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
To give you an idea, the traffic and our 
13 recorder is 120 channels. It is very tough just to 
14 say give me the calls pertaining to Ferguson. I 
15 couldn't sit there, it would take me two years to 
16 play every call and figure out what had to do with 
17 it. The ones that I made, here they are, you know, 
18 pick out what you want and let me know and I will 
19 try put them in order or go back and record just 
20 those incidents. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I do have a disc that has 
22 911 calls on it and, you know, there are some that 
23 have to do with this. I don't want to characterize 
24 them as they don't really help you with anything 
25 because I don't want to be the person, I don't want

1 that to be my judgment, but if you want to hear 
2 that, I have them. 
3 A Just to give you an idea, they have their 
4 own 911 center. So if they call from landline, they 
5 are going to Ferguson. 
6 So what the county took could have 
7 been cell calls that hit a tower facing, that is 
8 pointed to the county as opposed to Ferguson? 
9 That's where I was going 
10 with that, I was just wondering if there were any 
11 911 callers that witnessed something that did not 
12 come forward to be interviewed by anybody, anybody's 
13 doing that crosscheck? 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: That would be a good 
15 question for Detective Wilson when he's going to 
16 come and testify close to the end. There are lots 
17 of leads that were followed up that went nowhere. 
18 He would be able to talk about those kind of things 
19 and so I don't want to characterize it and say, yea 
20 or nay. Any of those type of questions he would be 
21 the one to ask. 
22 Anyone else? 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: , did you have 
24 something? 
25 I did, I wanted to make

1 sure when testified earlier this week, 
2 he mentioned there were like 16 or 19 channels, 
3 something like that, that the police officers could 
4 be on. There were a number of channels that the 
5 police officers could be on and in my notes I put 
6 that there are five RIOT channels, there is dispatch 
7 channel, mutual aid channel, the point-to-point 
8 channel and some other channels. 
9 So just because somebody may not be on 
10 here doesn't necessarily mean it might not be on 
11 another one of those channels? 
12 A Correct. Some are receive only, it all 
13 goes back to like --
14 Point-to-point is receive 
15 only. 
16 A Hey, you're good. 
17 I know, thank you. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm going to quiz you about 
19 DNA. Any other questions for this witness?

9 Q Can you state your name, please, and spell

11 A 
12 Q All right. And, I'm going to 
13 stand back here because the microphone that's in 
14 front of you does not amplify your voice. So you're 
15 going to have to speak loud enough that I can hear 
16 you back here, then I know they can all hear you,

(Nods head.) 
When I ask you questions, and you shook 
20 your head yes, because we're recording and the court 
21 reporter is taking it down, there is no way that 
22 gets recorded. So I might remind you if I ask you a 
23 question and you shake your head, I might say is 
24 that a yes, but if you can remember, try to say yes 
25 or no to answer the question so that he can take it
