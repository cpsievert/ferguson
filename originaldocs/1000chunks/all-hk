4 saw some or all of this incident, correct? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so then in the next photograph, 
7 turning clockwise still, is that also Building 
8 
9 
10 
Number 
A 
Q 
? 
That's also Building , yes. 
And then the final photograph you come 
11 full circle again, now west down Canfield Drive; 1s 
12 that correct? 
13 
14 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any questions about this

A 
A 
GRAND JUROR: I didn't get the very first 
This one here? 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
This is Building which 1s right here. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Where was 
23 apartment here in Building 
24 A His apartment would have been, it 1s hard 
25 to see.

2 A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
So the second, yeah. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions about 
4 this group of photographs? 
5 And, of course, you can always ask later. 
6 At this time let's take a quick break while the 
7 detective and I redo the photographs and put them 1n 
8 the correct order and then we'll finish with that 
9 board and then we'll probably just go on to your 
10 questions about the investigation. 
11 (Recess) 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS Kathi Alizadeh and 
13 Sheila Whirley is present, we took a short break 
14 while the detective and I rearranged the photos in 
15 the top row. The rest of them, apparently, were 
16 right, but I had gotten the top row wrong. So let's 
17 start over with this board, which is 105. And 
18 again, based on the photograph that's on the back of 
19 the board, you can tell what perspective these 
20 photographs were from which is from where, 
21 Detective? 
22 A Again, this is from the eastern most point 
23 that witnesses had identified Michael Brown's 
24 traveling on Canfield Drive. So, aga1n, we are 
25 talking about the intersection of Coppercreek Court 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 50 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and Canfield Drive and the northwest, northern 
2 portion of the intersection right there. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. So the first 
4 photograph, again, all of these photographs are the 
5 photographer standing or straddling the cone that 
6 was placed there, and these cones that you placed 
7 for the photographer's benefit, were these based on 
8 measurements that you did that day? 
9 A They were based on measurements that were 
10 taken on August 9th and then measurements, again, 
11 that we did on the day that these photographs were 
12 taken, yes. 
13 
14 
Q And so you are talking about the 
measurements that were taken by Detective 
15 the day that he documented the crime scene? 
16 A Yes. 
on 
17 Q Okay. And so you used those measurements 
18 and then measured for yourself to determine exactly 
19 where the police car was, and exactly where the body 
20 was, and of course, the exact location of where 
21 Michael Brown stopped and turned around is just 
22 based upon various witness accounts; is that right? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And so for these photographs, this is the 
25 best of your information that this would have been 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 51 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the farthest east that he went before turning 
2 around? 
3 A The best information we had at that time, 
4 yes. 
5 Q Okay. Is there any change 1n that? You 
6 said at that time? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
No, no. 
Okay, all right. So in the first 
9 photograph, again, we're looking down Canfield 
10 Drive, correct? 
11 A That's correct. 
12 Q And the, in the background somewhat, maybe 
13 midrange 1n that photograph, you see the memorial 
14 where there is another cone and there's flowers and 
15 candles and stuffed animals, is that the location 
16 where Michael Brown's body was? 
17 A That cone has nothing to do with the cone 
18 that we placed. That cone was there when we arrived 
19 and that cone was left there, obviously, when we 
20 
21 
22 
left. We brought our own cone. 
the meaning of that cone. 
I would discount 
Q Okay. But that general location, so 
23 someone who was standing where the photographer 1s, 
24 you can get a feel of how far away Michael Brown's 
25 body came to rest in this first photograph, correct? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 52 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And then the second photograph 1s 
3 mov1ng clockwise? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And what building 1s that that we see? 
6 A Building right here. (indicating) 
7 Q And I think we talked about it, but let's 
8 recap, looking at the first photograph there, can 
9 you see the corner of that white house where 
10 says he was? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
You can. 
Okay. 
It is right there. (indicating) 
Now looking at the second photograph you 
15 said you see what building number is that? 
16 A And the second photograph that's Building 
17 
18 Q 
19 correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
And that would be where lives, 
That's correct. 
And I'm just going to really quickly go 
22 through these aga1n. Three, you are moving farther 
23 clockwise? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And you see the dumpster where the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 53

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
were close to, correct? 
Correct. 
And that would have been where 
and possibly were, correct? 
Correct. 
And then 1n the fourth photograph, aga1n, 
7 turning a little more clockwise. In the background, 
8 can you see what buildings? 
9 A That is Building right here. And then 
10 if we move to the left, we moved onto Building and 
11 this 1s a portion of Building right here. 
12 Q All right. And then the fifth photograph 
13 now you are looking east on Canfield Drive, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And again, you see a number of buildings 
16 1n the background there? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Those would be? 
Building 
I'm sorry. , which 1s on the north 
21 side of the street? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then what are the buildings on the 
24 south side of the street that are visible? 
25 A Building , Building , and that may be 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 54 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014

a portion of Building right there. 
Q 
3 again? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
Put your laser pointer on Building 
Building 
And that was where the and 
were, correct? 
Right. 
8 Q And then turning a little clockwise. In 
9 the 6th photograph in the group. What building's 
10 visible there? 
A This right here would be Building , and 11 
12 this right here would be Building , a portion of 
13 Building 
14 Q 
15 lives? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Building 
And Building 1s where 
Right, yes. 
And then on Photograph Number ? 
We've moved onto it. This is entirely 
right here. 
20 Q And then building, I'm sorry, photograph 
21 the 8th photograph? 
22 A This is Building here aga1n, and now we 
23 see a portion of Building right here. 
24 Q And that parking lot that is seen between 
25 those two buildings, that is the parking lot where 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 55 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 says she parked her car; is that 
2 right? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
5 clockwise? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then in the 9th photograph, mov1ng 
6 A We are essentially see1ng that 1s all 
7 Building right there. 
8 Q And that would have been where 
was? 
Correct. 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q And then also in that image, let me see. 
12 We talked about seeing the mailboxes in one of these 
13 1mages. I hope it is in these. Pointing here, can 
14 you put your laser pointer right here. There 1s a 
15 black vehicle that appears to be parked there and 
16 then there's something behind the black vehicle. 
17 Would that be about where those mailboxes, those 
18 metal rows of mailboxes were? 
19 A It is. If you look at Photo 1 here, you 
20 can see the top, you will have to take my word for 
21 it, that's the top of the mailboxes right there. 
22 
23 
Q And that would be where 
she was near the mailboxes where she ended up. 
24 traveled from one point to another, correct? 
25 A Yes, ma'am. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 
said 
She 
56 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q Okay. And then finally in the lOth 
2 photograph, again, we have come 360. You are 
3 looking back down west on Canfield Drive, correct? 
4 
5 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody have any questions 
6 about this group of photographs? Did I confuse 
7 everybody by redoing them? Are you all okay with 
8 this? 
9 GRAND JUROR: I just have a quick question 
10 about the photographs that were taken from the 
11 vantage point of the officer's vehicle. Is this 
12 taken from like where his, the door of his vehicle 
13 was, you know what I'm saying, or was it like midway 
14 of the vehicle? 
15 
16 tire. 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
It was taken from the driver's side front 
GRAND JUROR: Driver's side front tire. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So where the cone was 
19 from that perspective, was from where the left front 
20 tire of Officer Wilson's vehicle was on the street? 
21 
22 
A Yes. 
GRAND JUROR: I just want to clarify for 
23 everybody and myself, the only cones we should pay 
24 attention to are the ones that are orange and white, 
25 the solid color orange someone else put there. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 57 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A The only cone that I would pay attention 
2 to is the cone that identifies in that first 
3 photograph where the detective would have been 
4 taking the photographs from. So I guess on the back 
5 here where we've identified is where we were 
6 actually taking the photographs from. 
7 So, yes, you are correct, these cones 
8 here, both of these cones here and this cone right 
9 here were obviously already there, we didn't place 
10 those there and those have no bearing in terms of 
11 the measurements that we took. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So when you would move 
13 from one location to the next to take pictures, 
14 would you remove the cone that you had previously 
15 placed? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So any cones that appear on the front of 
18 these boards are not cones that you have placed? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
All right. And then if you look on the 
21 back of those photographs, the cone that appears 1n 
22 those, on the back of the boards, the photograph 
23 that appears on the back of each board shows the 
24 cone where you placed it. Do show where the 
25 photographer was going to stand? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 58 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A Correct. Had I known there was go1ng to 
2 be cones out there already I probably would have 
3 taken something different for us to bring, but I 
4 didn't know that. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions about 
6 these photographs? 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Just briefly talk a 
8 little bit more about in this particular case the 
9 investigation and about the taking of witness 
10 statements. 
11 Virtually, not virtually, but almost 
12 all of the witness statements in this case that were 
13 taken were audio recorded, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And was there any reason for that, was 
16 there a decision why you were going to audio record 
17 certain statements or all of the statements? 
18 A By and large when we conduct homicide 
19 investigations, we record anybody with any pertinent 
20 information. And that's in this particular case or 
21 any other homicide investigation we are conducting. 
22 So it is essentially standard procedure for us to do 
23 that and so we did that in this particular instance 
24 too. 
25 Q And many of these recorded statements that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 59 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 we've heard that other officers have taken have been 
2 
3 
4 
5 
at libraries. 
he talked to 
Yes. 
Detective was at a library when 
, correct? 
A 
Q Different officers or detectives went to 
6 people's home to interview them. There was a 
7 witness interviewed at the NAACP headquarters and so 
8 would each detective have available to him a digital 
9 audio recorder to take with him if he were going to 
10 interview witnesses? 
11 A They are assigned by the departments their 
12 own recorders and we essentially carry those with us 
13 everywhere we go. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
Q I believe it was Detective and 
Detective who talked to , and 
, the I think 
it was that took the first statement from 
18 them that was audio recorded, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then Detective took another 
21 statement from them later, what was the reason for 
22 his second statement? 
23 
24 
25 
A The second statement was taken because we 
had received information that both and 
had shortly after the incident took 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 60 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 place written notes or written a document outlining 
2 what they had witnessed. And, obviously, that would 
3 be something that we would want to view if they 
4 would give us permission. So we went out and 
5 contacted them and asked for permission to view 
6 those items. 
7 Q So the fact that they both made written 
8 statements, they did not disclose that to you when 
9 you first, when Detective first talked to 
10 them, would that be correct? 
11 A That's correct. 
12 Q So there was a decision made once you 
13 found out about these written statements, somebody 
14 else needed to go out there, talk to them aga1n and 
15 try to get these statements from them, correct? 
16 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: How did you find out about 
19 the statements. 
20 A I believe it was their superv1sor had made 
21 reference to it when we were contacting him. So 
22 they were originally told by their superv1sor to 
23 write down their comments or write down their 
24 account of what they witnessed. So they did that 
25 and that was ultimately conveyed to us and so then 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 61 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 we went out and talked to and 
2 and asked that it was true, and they 
3 indicated it was and we obtained those. 
4 
5 
6 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, 
another interview conducted of 
after Detective 
7 them a second time? 
That's correct. 
there was yet aga1n 
and 
had talked to 
8 
9 
A 
Q What was the reason for the third 
10 interview? 
11 A During the course of the investigation, 
12 obviously, it 1s an evolving investigation and we've 
13 we're learned things on a daily basis. If I can go 
14 back in time to when we were contacting Dorian 
15 Johnson. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
And that would have been on the 13th? 
Yes, ma'am. So during the course of 
18 Dorian Johnson's interview, he talked about speaking 
19 with, he didn't mention them by name, 
20 and And during the interview with 
21 Dorian Johnson he made reference to 
22 
23 
24 
and talking with Michael Brown about 
marlJuana and about waxing. 
I had no idea what wax1ng was. We 
25 later learned that waxing delivers essentially a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 62 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 high concentration of THC to an individual in a very 
2 short period of time. So THC is the active 
3 ingredient in marlJuana. 
4 That didn't necessarily mean much to 
5 me until we learned from the autopsy report that 
6 Michael Brown had THC in his system and we learned 
7 that after speaking with Dr. from the St. Louis 
8 County Medical Examiner's Office, that his level was 
9 elevated to the point where it could have 
10 potentially caused a loss in perception of space and 
11 time and there was also the possibility that there 
12 could have been hallucinations. He couldn't say 
13 that for sure, but that is a potential effect of 
14 high levels of THC in an individual. 
15 So knowing that waxing delivers a 
16 high level of THC to an individual in a relatively 
17 short period of time and knowing that from Dorian 
18 Johnson, Michael Brown had had conversations with 
19 and about waxing, we 
20 thought it worth exploring the possibility that 
21 either gave, or 
22 provided, or sold wax to Michael Brown. And if that 
23 was the case, it could have potentially explained 
24 some of the behavior that we witnessed from Michael 
25 Brown on the audio, I'm sorry on the video at the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 63 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Ferguson Market and help explain some of the things 
2 taking place in this particular incident. 
3 Q All right. Now, had either 
4 or in their first two statements to 
5 County Police said anything about having discussions 
6 with Michael Brown about waxing? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
No. 
All right. Did you make a decision that 
9 you were going to attempt to reinterview both of 
10 those gentlemen? 
11 A We did. 
12 Q Now, on this occas1on though, you did not 
13 go out to their homes or their places of employment 
14 or a library, you actually brought them into the 
15 county police department and put them in an 
16 interview room where you often interview suspects, 
17 correct? 
18 A We contacted at his home and 
19 requested he accompany us back to our office and he 
20 agreed to do so. We contacted at a 
21 job site that he was working on and we did the same 
22 thing for him. We asked him to accompany us back to 
23 our office for an interview and they both 
24 voluntarily agreed to do so. 
25 Q So they were not under arrest? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 64 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
They were not. 
And when they were brought to your 
3 headquarters, did you bring them in during the same 
4 evening? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Did you interview them separately? 
Yes. 
And those interviews we seen were video 
9 and audio recorded; is that right? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q Prior to interviewing them you advised 
12 each one of them of their Miranda Rights? 
13 A We did, yes. 
14 Q And that wouldn't be something that you 
15 have done with other witnesses in this investigation 
16 g1v1ng them Miranda Rights, is that fair to say? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
And so why is it that you felt that you 
19 needed to advise these two of their Miranda Rights? 
20 A Miranda applies if there is an incident 
21 where there is custody and meaning individuals in 
22 custody, and there is a potential that we're going 
23 to ask guilt seeking questions. They were obviously 
24 not in custody, however, we were going to be asking 
25 them a series of questions and the purpose of the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 65 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 interview was to bring them 1n and ask them about 
2 this waxing. 
3 So we were go1ng to be asking them a 
4 ser1es of questions regarding waxing and the use of 
5 it and whether they had provided or sold or done 
6 anything to give Michael Brown and/or Dorian Johnson 
7 marlJuana or wax. 
8 And so based on that, I felt it was 
9 1n our best interest to error on the side of 
10 caution, be safe, there is nothing wrong with doing 
11 this and just Mirandize them just in the sense of we 
12 are going to be asking them guilt seeking questions. 
13 That could potentially impact future situations if 
14 they were to provide us information that could 
15 implicate them in a crime. 
16 Q All right. And so now when you brought 
17 each of those individuals 1n and began your 
18 questioning of them, you know, we've seen the 
19 videos, they both deny having anything to do with 
20 giving Michael Brown or Dorian Johnson any control 
21 substances, is that fair to say? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And they denied it from the beginning and 
24 yet you continue to question them for a substantial 
25 period of time; is that right? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 66 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
We did, yes. 
Now, this interview, how are these 
3 interviews different from the interviews that you 
4 have done with other witnesses because these two men 
5 were eyewitnesses or claim to have been eyewitnesses 
6 to a shooting? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Not suspects in the investigation, not 
9 even subjects in the investigation, but witnesses? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Why treat them differently than you did 
12 other witnesses 1n this case? 
13 A Well, if you've seen the video, you'll 
14 notice that we stayed away from discussing their 
15 accounts of the incident itself. And the incident I 
16 mean with Darren Wilson and with Michael Brown. 
17 Our motivation in speaking with them 
18 was purely to discuss the waxing aspect of it to see 
19 if there was anything that we were missing 1n this 
20 particular instance. 
21 So the reality 1s, when we speak to 
22 people, we're not always told the truth in terms of, 
23 right away 1n terms of what is going on. That's the 
24 reality of our job, sometimes people tell us the 
25 truth, but in other instances they do not.

1 I mean, very few people are willing 
2 to come into an office and tell a deep dark secret 
3 or tell some sort of illegal activity that they've 
4 done after they have just met someone 1n a very 
5 brief period of time. 
6 So as such there are var1ous types of 
7 interviews that we can do. We can do it what I'm 
8 go1ng to call just a pure fact gathering interview 
9 where we sit down with somebody and we just document 
10 what they've told us. 
11 There are nonconfrontational 
12 interviews where we can generally discuss a topic 
13 with an individual in attempt to elicit information 
14 and there are what I would call a direct 
15 confrontation interview where we are directly 
16 confronting people and calling out those individuals 
17 on any inconsistencies or anything that we may 
18 believe that they may not be telling us the truth 
19 on. 
20 I don't have a hard and fast rule by 
21 1n large, I don't have a hard and fast rule how I 
22 conduct one interview. A lot of it is just based 
23 off of how a particular individual is reacting in an 
24 interview or how a particular interview is going, 
25 but ultimately we are looking for the truth and 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 68 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 sometimes it is hard to get that out of people 
2 initially. So we have to press them and we ask 
3 questions repeatedly and kind of like a salesman, we 
4 don't take no for an answer the first time. 
5 We, obviously, have an obligation to 
6 get to the truth to some extent and part of that 1s 
7 pressing people to see if they're really telling us 
8 the truth. 
9 Q But it is true, isn't it, Detective, that 
10 throughout your interview or interrogation of these 
11 two men, neither one of them ever admitted or said 
12 that they have been in any way involved in providing 
13 controlled narcotics to Michael Brown or Dorian 
14 Johnson; is that true? 
15 A Yes, that's correct. 
16 Q And your investigation has failed to find 
17 any information otherwise; is that true? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's true. 
And I think we discussed briefly and aga1n 
20 I'm go1ng to reiterate here, to your understanding, 
21 now you've completed your police report in this 
22 case; 1s that right? 
23 A I have. 
24 Q How many pages 1s your police report? 
25 A I don't know exactly, 1,100, 1,200 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 69 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 roughly. 
2 Q And so you've concluded your police 
3 report, but in reality does this investigation 
4 continue so long as there are witnesses who might 
5 come forward or want to be interviewed? 
6 A I would always add a supplement to the 
7 report that has been submitted if more people came 
8 forward, yes. 
9 Q And isn't it true, Detective, or let me 
10 ask you this, if at the conclusion of this grand 
11 jury investigation if there is information that 
12 comes to you regarding this investigation that is 1n 
13 any way relevant or pertinent to this investigation, 
14 would you bring that to my attention? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I will. 
And you're aware that there is no statute 
17 of limitations for murder or for class A felonies, 
18 correct? 
19 A I'm aware of that, yes. 
20 Q And that a prosecution against Officer 
21 Wilson could be brought at any time. In other 
22 words, even 50 years from today? 
23 
24 
25 this. 
A 
Q 
I'm aware of that, yes, ma'am. 
And if there would be, let me ask you 
You've reviewed a number of videos that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 70 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 people have recorded from var1ous devices, cell 
2 phones mainly, who claim to have recorded the 
3 shooting; is that right? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q Have you ever discussed a video that 
6 actually shows any part of the confrontation from 
7 the beginning where from the officer stopping to 
8 first confront or talk to those two boys all the way 
9 to the shooting itself? 
10 A I have not. 
11 Q Okay. Every video that you have seen 1n 
12 relation to this investigation, video of the 
13 aftermath of the shooting? 
14 A Every one, yes. 
15 Q Have you heard rumors that there's videos 
16 of the shooting out there? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
I have heard those rumors, yes. 
Have you done investigation to try to 
19 discover whether those rumors are true or track down 
20 people that have videos of the actual shooting 
21 itself? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, we have. 
And have those leads produced anything? 
No, they have not. 
And you're aware that even after this 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 71 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 investigation by the grand jury 1s concluded, we've 
2 discussed this, the possibility that there 1s for 
3 some reason somebody out there has a video that they 
4 have not come forward with, if that video were to be 
5 discovered by law enforcement, we could represent 
6 this to a grand jury; is that correct? 
7 
8 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: All have heard the term 
9 double jeopardy. Double jeopardy does not apply 
10 unless there is a trail jury that considers the 
11 facts. And so if a case starts, if there is a trial 
12 that starts with a trial Jury, that's when jeopardy 
13 attaches and someone can never be tried after that 
14 if there's a verdict or after that they can't be 
15 retried. 
16 Your decision, though, does not create 
17 jeopardy. In other words, there's no reason that 
18 there couldn't be additional investigation in the 
19 future or another consideration by probably not you 
20 all probably would be another grand jury if there 
21 would be something down the road, but in this case, 
22 Detective, you're aware still that the federal 
23 authorities have not concluded their investigation; 
24 1s that right? 
25 A That's correct. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 72 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) They're still looking 
2 for people? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Still trying to talk to people who have 
5 been unwilling to talk? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And if down the road those witnesses were 
8 to come forward with relevant information that may 
9 change the investigation, you would bring that to my 
10 attention wouldn't you? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
I would. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, you have questions? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Just a few. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Regarding the accuracy of 
15 these perspective photos, you don't walk it out with 
16 the witness that you gave information to test the 
17 accuracy of it? How do you come up with, you may 
18 have already told us, I thought you did, I want to 
19 understand how accurate the photos are. 
20 A Sure. In terms of on August 9th, one of 
21 our cr1me scene detective's jobs was to take various 
22 measurements of items of evidence at the scene. And 
23 he used what starts as a baseline at Coppercreek 
24 Court and Canfield Court, and used this baseline 
25 here and measured items during the entire, I should 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 73 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 say, within the entire cr1me scene and those items 
2 were documented in a diagram that he completed with 
3 specific measurements, feet down to inches. 
4 So when we went back out there to 
5 take those 360 degree panoramic shots, we based, 
6 obviously, Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive 1s 
7 subjective in the sense that we are basing that off 
8 of where, again, witnesses were telling us is the 
9 furthest point east that Michael Brown would have 
10 went. 
11 So that 1s a subjective point that we 
12 use that intersection, northwest corner of that 
13 intersection right there. 
14 However, the point where Michael 
15 Brown's body was located and the point where the 
16 vehicle was located, was measured on that day based 
17 off the measurements that were taken on August 9th. 
18 Q And when you take photographs showing 
19 where people live and what building that they would 
20 have, their vantage point was, that's based on 
21 statements that they gave you as to where they were 
22 located? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. So if you don't have that exactly 
25 right, then that's not going to be accurate? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 74 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A Correct, I am basing it only off of 
2 statements that they were able to provide to us, 
3 yes. 
4 Q Okay. And then you knew that swabs that 
5 were taken, evidence was gathered for DNA in this 
6 case? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
The officer's belt, the officer's gun, 
9 some other items? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
You were part of that or your team decided 
12 what to se1ze as evidence? 
13 A For the most part, yes. 
14 Q Okay. And there's been testimony that 
15 Michael Brown was grabbed by the throat, was his 
16 throat swabbed for DNA sample? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Was Michael Brown's throat? 
Throat swabbed? 
I don't believe so. 
You may not have had that information when 
21 you gathered that information. Had you ever heard 
22 that before that he was grabbed, the officer grabbed 
23 him by the throat? 
24 A I had heard that and as I sit here today, 
25 I couldn't tell you what day I heard that.

1 Q But you do know, no one collected a swab
