GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XV 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is Thursday, 
Page 5 
5 October 23rd at 9:06 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh, 
6 Sheila Whirley is also present, all 12 grand jurors 
7 are present as well as , the court reporter, 
8 and we need to take up a few matters before we begin 
9 with witnesses today. 
10 Urn, I would imagine all of you, I mean, 
11 most of you, if not all of you, have been aware that 
12 there have been media reports out there that seem to 
13 indicate that there are leaks in the investigation 
14 and that reports have been leaked and testimony has 
15 been leaked and so forth. 
16 And first off, as I've said from the very 
17 beginning, you all have to be guided by what occurs 
18 in this room. We all know sometimes the media 
19 doesn't get things right, but you know, if you do 
20 read those things, you need to make sure you take 
21 that with a grain of salt. You all have heard all 
22 the evidence together, so you know what you have 
23 heard and seen. 
24 But I do want to say, and Sheila and I 
25 have had a conference, we've had a conference with

Grand Jury, Volume XV October 23, 2014 
Page 6 
1 Mr. McCulloch, we've had conferences with a lot of 
2 others, with the County Police Department and 
3 everything, and I can assure you that we know that 
4 the leak, that the leaks are not coming from the 
5 grand jury. There is no doubt in our minds that 
6 none of you are the source of that. 
7 And to tell you the truth, one of the 
8 reasons that I know that is the medical examiner's 
9 report is out there and I've looked at what's out 
10 there, what was leaked by the Post-Dispatch, it was 
11 put out there by the Post-Dispatch and I can tell 
12 you it is not the copy that you have. It is the 
13 medical examiner's report, but every medical 
14 examiner's report that we get has a stamp on it. It 
15 says not for secondary release. 
16 And the report that is out there that was 
17 published by the Post-Dispatch does have that stamp 
18 on there, but it is not the same stamp that I have, 
19 and I know it is not the same stamp that is on your 
20 copy. 
21 So it says the same thing, but their's is 
22 in a straight line and it is different looking than 
23 our stamp, the stamp that we have on our copies. 
24 And the same thing with the County Police, 
25 it is different than the stamp that they have from

1 their copies. 
2 So wherever this came from, it did not 
3 come from our office, it did not come from you guys. 
4 You don't have a copy that looks like that, it did 
5 not come from the County Police. 
6 And the other reason why we're fairly, not 
7 fairly, we're 100 percent confident that this is not 
8 coming from the grand jurors or from the County 
9 Police is that in the very beginning when there was 
10 a supposed leak, this was a story that was broken by 
11 the New York Times, but it was their Washington 
12 Bureau that published the story and they cited their 
13 source as a government official who had been briefed 
14 on the civil rights investigation. 
15 We are sharing our information with the 
16 federal government because they are conducting their 
17 own independent investigation and so they have all 
18 the same reports and the same things that we have. 
19 And so we are confident that the leak is 
20 someone in probably the Department of Justice and is 
21 not coming from St. Louis County Police, not from 
22 our office, and not from this grand jury. 
23 I know you all maybe were concerned about 
24 that, but we are 100 percent confident that we're 
25 all good.

leave so that being said, 
to know that we still have 
in the grand jury and the 
we know that you're going 
going to be guided by the 
heard during your 
I 
to do 
10 So that's the first thing. Anything else 
11 that we discussed that needs to be said? 
12 The other thing that we have talked about 
13 at the very beginning of this process we kind of had 
14 set a goal for ourselves that we were going to try 
15 to complete this by mid November. 
16 If you recall that was originally the idea 
17 that we could extend the grand jury or that it could 
18 be a six month term and that would put you at like 
19 mid November. It was then again extended to 
20 January, that was done just out of an abundance of 
21 caution in case we didn't get done by mid November. 
22 We still would like to finish by mid 
23 November. I can tell you that the light is at the 
24 end of the tunnel so to speak. We have discussed 
25 what we have left to put on and I will tell you

1 there are approximately 15 eyewitnesses or lay 
2 witnesses who we believe would have valuable 
3 testimony to give. However, I will tell you that I 
4 don't know, we are making our best efforts to get 
5 everyone in, but I can tell you that you some of 
6 these witnesses are resisting. 
7 Some of them have frankly said there is no 
8 way I'm coming in, no way I'm going to testify. 
9 We're trying to get witnesses under subpoena, but if 
10 you knock on the door and nobody answers, we have no 
11 right to, you know, kick in the door and serve them 
12 with a subpoena. 
13 We can only do so much. So even though we 
14 have potentially 15 lay witnesses that we may still 
15 call, I expect we are not going to be able to call 
16 all of those witnesses. We are going to do our 
17 best. 
18 But in the event that we want to wrap this 
19 up, if we try our best to wrap this up in mid 
20 November, we talked about possibly going to again a 
21 three day a week schedule. That would, you know, 
22 again, we're trying to get this completed and by all 
23 means, there is no deadline so you all don't feel 
24 that you have the time, there is no magic date, 
25 there is no reason this hasn't to be done on a

1 certain date. 
2 With that in mind, if you can talk during 
3 your lunch break today about your November schedule 
4 because we don't have any dates yet for November and 
5 think about including an additional day. 
6 I know you've been very generous to give 
7 us two days a week, and keep in mind as well that 
8 from the very beginning we've said if you all need 
9 to meet in the evening or Saturday or Sunday, even 
10 if it is a half day on Saturday or Sunday, we will 
11 be there, we will do it. 
12 The other thing that we talked about is 
13 that there was a question early on about possibly 
14 getting the police vehicle for you all to see for 
15 yourself, which I've already investigated that and 
16 we can't. 
17 It's been repaired, so it has a window in 
18 it now and I haven't seen it myself whether or not 
19 the demarcation where the bullet hole was, I don't 
20 know if that's still there. But I know that you are 
21 interested in how big the vehicle is, how tall it 
22 is, what it might be like to stand next to it and so 
23 forth. 
24 We can have that done a number of ways. 
25 We can have that done a number of ways. We can

1 bring that here and made available for you in the 
2 parking garage for you all to get in, examine, get 
3 around. However, if we do it here, it would be wise 
4 not to do it during business hours, because there's 
5 really no place in the parking garage where we can 
6 do this where people won't see you up and around a 
7 Ferguson Police car. 
8 We have construction workers in the 
9 parking garage, there are county employees, we have 
10 just members of the public that can park in the 
11 parking garage. 
12 If you would like to see the vehicle here 
13 in this location, I would suggest that maybe if we 
14 do that on an evening or weekend where nobody will 
15 be down here, no construction workers, very few 
16 county employees. 
17 The other possibility is that we could 
18 bring the vehicle to the St. Louis County Police 
19 Academy, which is in Wellston, it is maybe a 15 
20 minute drive from here. We put you all in a van and 
21 take you out there. 
22 They've got a secure garage and you could 
23 exit there. If you recall Detective talked 
24 about it, they had towed it to their garage which is 
25 a secure facility here in Clayton.

I can

1 investigate whether or not that garage might be 
2 available. 
3 The problem with that is, it contains 
4 other evidence, there might be things in there the 
5 County Police may say, yeah, we can't let these 
6 people in here, we have other evidence in other 
7 cases and it would be compromised, the integrity of 
8 other investigations. So, plus I'm not 100 percent 
9 sure that that garage is even still there. 
10 They're in the process of demolishing 
11 buildings, that might not even be available, but 
12 those are a couple options bringing it here and 
13 seeing it on a weekend or evening or taking a field 
14 trip to the police academy to exit there. So you 
15 guys can talk about that as well. 
16 Sheila has a better recollection than me, 
17 so I have to always ask her did I forget everything. 
18 
19 
MS. WHIRLEY: She has the gift of grab. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I do. I'm the mouth and 
20 she's the brains. So you all had asked for a 
21 topographical map at some point, I have one that I 
22 will pass out today. Don't know how helpful it is 
23 going to be for you. I looked at it, I don't know. 
24 It is the only one that we can come up with without 
25 actually, you know, I guess hiring a company to go

1 out there and do that. 
2 And then also you had asked for the floor 
3 plans of the apartments in the complex, I've got 
4 that as well. 
5 Also, there was a question about whether 
6 or not we were going to call Dr. , the 
7 pathologist who was hired by the family of Michael 
8 Brown to perform an independent autopsy. It was 
9 actually the second autopsy on the remains. 
10 There was then later a third autopsy that 
11 was done by the Department of Defense medical 
12 examiners, which I expect we'll call one of them to 
13 tell you what their findings were. 
14 We have contacted the attorney who 
15 represents the family of Michael Brown and asked 
16 that they contact Dr. and invite him to 
17 testify. 
18 So we haven't heard back if he's going to 
19 be available to do that, or if he's willing to do 
20 that, but we're going to make those efforts to try 
21 to get him here because I know that there was a 
22 question about that. 
23 What would I do without Sheila. Now, as I 
24 said, we have potentially 15 more eyewitnesses who 
25 may be testifying. And it's been our habit and our

1 process during this time to play for you every 
2 recorded statement that a witness has made. 
3 We initially were, our goal and plan was 
4 to do that before the witness testified, sometimes 
5 that didn't work out, but we've always gotten around 
6 to playing it eventually for you. 
7 As you know, sometimes these witnesses 
8 make two or three recorded statements, sometimes 
9 you've got, you know, statements that are in excess 
10 of an hour, hour and a half, hour and 40 minutes, 
11 two hours. 
12 And so our question to you is we can 
13 proceed in that manner as we've done in the past or 
14 we're wondering if you find it helpful to listen to 
15 those statements if those statements are consistent 
16 with what the witness testifies to. 
17 So if the witness testifies, like if we 
18 put a witness on and they testify, and Sheila and I 
19 who have listened to these tapes feel that there's 
20 really no inconsistency in what they already said. 
21 I mean, obviously, any statement there could be, you 
22 know, minor inconsistencies, and that will be 
23 something that she and I will discuss together about 
24 whether we think that there are inconsistencies. 
25 And if we feel that there are not, it

Page 15 
1 would be possible if you feel that that doesn't help 
2 you to hear this tape statement again, that we then 
3 just forgo playing that taped statement. 
4 Obviously, it takes up a lot of time and I 
5 know it is tiring for you all to sit here and listen 
6 and read transcripts. 
7 So maybe you can discuss that during your 
8 lunch as well. If you think that that would be a 
9 way to go to try to speed through this. I don't 
10 mean speed through it in a way that's not efficient. 
11 I don't want to say we're rushing through anything, 
12 but if you are finding that it is not really that 
13 helpful and you don't need to hear it, then we don't 
14 have to play it. 
15 We have it, we have all of them and, of 
16 course, if at any time you would have some issue 
17 with, you know what, maybe we should hear that 
18 witness' statement that they made before, at any 
19 time we can play it for you, okay. So that's 
20 something for you to consider. All right. 
21 Is there anything, you know, that anybody 
22 has an issue or question about? You can discuss 
23 this during your lunch and then we'll ask questions 
24 during the lunch break, especially if we are talking 
25 about scheduling issues and things of that nature.

1 Don't necessarily need to afford those kind of 
2 things, but let me know after lunch and we have, I 
3 think, two people here right now, and going to have 
4 to give me a second to get somewhat organized. 
5 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. 
7 Officer Wilson, he only 
8 had one recorded statement? I know we only heard 
9 one, if I'm not mistaken. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: If I'm not mistaken, 
11 Officer Wilson's statement was not recorded prior to 
12 him testifying. Check your folders to see if you 
13 have a transcript of the testimony of Darren Wilson? 
14 We have one. 
15 There was supposed to have 
16 been one with Detective 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Detective did one that 
18 wasn't recorded and then there was one that was 
19 recorded, you have a transcript of that? 
20 We have one that is 
21 recorded. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: My recollection is, we can 
23 certainly go back and look at the transcripts, but 
24 that Sergeant testified about statements that 
25 he made right at the scene when he first got there,

1 and none of that was recorded. And then 
2 was the detective who went to the police 
3 station and did a cursory interview and that was not 
4 recorded. And then, you have one? 
5 That must have been done on the 9th at 
6 10:00 in the morning? 
7 August lOth. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: lOth, okay. The 9th is the 
9 day of. I knew it was the next morning. All right. 
10 And then there was Agent who came 
11 in and testified that she had interviewed him, but 
12 that their interview was not recorded, I believe. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Right. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. I forgot about 
15 that. 
16 Again, if there is a need to bring any 
17 witness back that you have already heard from 
18

because

was easier 
know, just 
early on in 
additional questions, you just 
We put on things in a way that 
for you to understand the case, 
the sake of when we put on a 
the process and then now later 
23 in the process you might think well, I didn't know 
24 that when I heard from that witness before, so now I 
25 have a couple of additional questions.

1 So if anyone of you feel the need to have 
2 any witness who has testified previously return and 
3 answer some questions, we will get them here. And 
4 obviously, Officer Wilson, I cannot compel him to 
5 appear before you, but he appeared previously and I 
6 would reach out to his representatives to invite him 
7 back if you felt that you would want to hear from 
8 him again. 
9 Any other questions? 
10 Is there any 
11 recorded testimony with Officer Darren Wilson and 
12 the FBI or the civil rights investigation? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: My understanding is, no, 
14 that they did not record that. If you recall it was 
15 the brunette female FBI agent 
16 who came in and testified that she was present and 
17 interviewed him that they did not record that. 
18 I know, now this is 
19 reported in the newspaper or whatever, there was a 
20 statement that was supposedly made by him about the 
21 first two shots. In our transcripts he didn't think 
22 he hit him on the second shot because he saw some 
23 dirt fly up. But then it was reported later on that 
24 he said he thought he did hit him with the second 
25 shot. I just wondered if there was any recorded

1 evidence of him saying that? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Not that I'm aware of. And 
3 I will tell you that, you know, as you can probably 
4 imagine, any news agency is not going to reveal to 
5 me who the source of their information is. They 
6 have this First Amendment thing, freedom of the 
7 press. 
8 And so while it might be -- make sense for 
9 me to call them and say, hey, where did you get that 
10 because we're interested and if you've heard that 
11 from another source, we'd like to hear who told you 
12 that, but they're not going to tell me. 
13 And that might be something that if you 
14 would care to have another witness back to testify 
15 to ask that question, but I don't know where that 
16 information came from for that particular news 
17 article. 
18 Two quick 
19 things. One, Grand Jury Exhibit Number 2 is the map 
20 that we use almost daily. I notice also it still 
21 says not to scale. Do you know if you would ever 
22 get one to scale or even if it is that much of a 
23 difference? 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: That's another thing. That 
25 brings up something else. There was a question

1 awhile back about getting a transparency that maybe 
2 would have the diagram images that we could lay on 
3 top of the map. I did look into that and the 
4 problem that I learned with doing that is that map 
5 is not to scale and so just because on the map I'm 
6 holding my fingers out, if the map says this is 
7 137 feet, I'm just making up a number, of course. 
8 There might be another place on the map that says 
9 this is 150 feet. And the actual measurement was 
10 accurately done, but the map might not be to scale, 
11 you know, the entrance, the driveway, you know, to 
12 some of these parking entrances might not be as wide 
13 in real life as it appears on the diagram. The size 
14 of the police vehicle is not necessarily on the 
15 diagram the exact size of what it is in the street. 
16 I would suggest that, you know, I have all 
17 of those crime scene photos and if you ever are 
18 curious about, you know, the real size of things, 
19 you can sift through those photos to see if they can 
20 help you determine or answer some of those 
21 questions, but I can ask about the possibility of 
22 having a diagram to scale. 
23 It is my, this is strictly my belief based 
24 upon my experience that when the police officers do 
25 these diagrams, they use a computer program that, I

1 don't think they are done freehand, I think they use 
2 a computer program to do these diagrams. And so to 
3 do one to scale would require someone, actually, a 
4 draftsman type of person, I think, to actually make 
5 sure that the diagram is to scale. 
6 So that would probably have to be done by 
7 not the police department, we probably would have to 
8 look into whether or not there could be some 
9 draftsman that could do that, but I mean, I can 
10 investigate that as well if you think it would be 
11 helpful. 
12 But as far as the transparency goes, I'm 
13 afraid it might even be misleading if we had a 
14 transparency and you laid it on top of the aerial 
15 photograph, it might appear that oh, look, this is 
16 actually not where it is in the picture because on 
17 the transparency it is past the fire hydrant. Well, 
18 that just might be because it is not to scale. So I 
19 wouldn't want you to rely on something and be misled 
20 by that. 
21 Yes. 
22 Prior to knowing 
23 I was on this case, I remember vaguely hearing in 
24 the news there was a gentleman on some sort of audio 
25 phone that recorded the succession of gunshots and

1 didn't know, again, I didn't pay much attention to 
2 it, I kept it in my memory. I didn't know if that 
3 was something even credible or something we will get 
4 to. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. That is something 
6 that the police have the custody of that recording 
7 and we will be putting that on for you as well. 
8 And there was a question quite some time 
9 ago about surveillance cameras in the complex and I, 
10 believe me, before you guys even got this 
11 assignment, that was one of the first questions out 
12 of my mouth. Are their surveillance cameras? I was 
13 told no. 
14 Now, before you complete your 
15 investigation, probably the very last witness that I 
16 will call for you to hear from is going to be 
17 Detective , because as the primary case agent, 
18 he knows more about this case than any other person. 
19 So there are some things that he's going 
20 to testify about that he did himself and whatnot, 
21 but he would be the person to ask a lot of these 
22 questions to because he was in charge of the 
23 investigation. 
24 What was done, what did you do about this, 
25 did you ever try to get ahold of this person, he can

1 answer a lot of those questions with firsthand 
2 knowledge. 
3 Me, all my knowledge about this comes from 
4 other sources because I was not out there 
5 investigating the case. So I don't want to be the 
6 person to actually have you rely on what I'm telling 
7 you, I'm just telling you that it is my 
8 understanding that there were not, but that would be 
9 a question better put to Detective about 
10 that, all right? 
11 Anyone else? 
12 Okay. We have a witness here, the first 
13 witness we are going to call and I'm not organized 
14 this morning. 
15 I know 
16 that had asked sometime ago would it 
17 be possible for us to see where this happened. And 
18 I know we had discussed it before and that probably 
19 wouldn't be in our best interest to go there. I 
20 think somebody had talked 
21 I think it was 
22 
23 About getting pictures of 
24 the distance and things like that?

1 we've had that done. I think that Detective 
2 when I put him on last we're going to have him show 
3 you those pictures because he'll be able to point 
4 out for you in the picture this apartment building 
5 right here or this window right here, this balcony 
6 right here, that's where witness so and so was. And 
7 if you see right here, that's where witness so and 
8 so was because he's the one that knows that 
9 information and in very intimate detail. 
10 So we do have pictures that we have the 
11 police and Detective went out with them to 
12 take those pictures to make sure we got the vantage 
13 points. We weren't able to take vantage point 
14 pictures from where the witness was that would 
15 require going into people's apartments and they felt 
16 that that wasn't going to be safe or welcomed. 
17 So the pictures that they took are from 
18 the location of where the vehicle was, the location 
19 of where Michael Brown's body laying in the street 
20 and then the location of the corner near a light 
21 post. And those pictures are done in 360, so you 
22 might be able to see from here can you see that 
23 witness' balcony who says they can see this. That's 
24 the best we can do as far as getting vantage point 
25 pictures.

1 I guess I do have a 
2 question. I know that some of these media reports 
3 they're saying that he had marijuana in his system. 
4 And I guess that's another way of knowing it didn't 
5 come from us because we were never told that he had 
6 marijuana in his system. 
7 So is there still like evidence out there 
8 that we haven't heard like that? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. 9 
10 
11 
The DNA on the gun? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yes, there's going to be, 
12 you know, our plan was to try to get through the 
13 eyewitnesses and then at the end put on some of the 
14 scientific evidence because frankly those witnesses 
15 are there at my fingertips and are going to come in 
16 whenever I tell them to come in. 
17 And so I just knew that when it came time 
18 to try to wrap things up, we would be able to get 
19 them through in and out fairly quickly. So I do

9 that I was not going to ask you to give your 
10 address, but there is a laser pointer that is 
11 sitting right in front of you there.

Uh-huh. 
And if you press this gray button here, it 
14 makes a laser pointer. Can you show the grand 
15 jurors on the map, which is marked Grand Jury 
16 Exhibit Number 25, do you recognize these streets, 
17 it says Canfield Drive, and for your reference over 
18 here is West Florissant, okay?

Q 
Uh-huh. 
And then over here is the Northwinds 
21 Apartments. So that does help orient you to

So that's the top floor? 
Right. 
And so this particular building has 
14 entrances for units that would be, actually those 
15 units would face the west if this is west. And then 
16 there's also some entrances to the building that 
17 face the east. Was your apartment facing the west 
18 or facing the east? 
19 A I'm kind of confused because the building 
20 sits like this and I can see out and see Canfield

11 is that right? You take some exterior steps up to 
12 the third floor; is that right? Is that how you get 
13 in your apartment? 
14 A Right. 
15 Q So the front door of your apartment is 
16 actually right there where that stairwell is, 
17 correct? 
18

Right. 
And so you have a window, you have a

2 around the corner? 
3 A No. 
4 Q No, okay. So you have a sliding glass 
5 door and a window, is that like a bedroom window? 
6 A Right.

8 front of your apartment, can you see down to 
9 Canfield Drive? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. So do you recall on the 
12 morning of August 9th, was there anything special 
13 about that day, that morning that you recall oh, it 
14 was, I remember it because it was, had these plans 
15 to do something or was it an ordinary day? 
16 A It was an ordinary day. I was just kind

3 had your windows opened or closed? 
4 A Closed. 
5 Q Do you normally run the air conditioning 
6 in the month of August? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q Okay. And so you said that you were 
9 looking out the window, was there a reason you 
10 looked out the window? Was there anything that drew 
11 your attention outside or were you just happening to 
12 be working out the window? 
13 A I just happen to be looking out. 
14 Q All right. And then once you were looking 
15 out, did you see something unusual? 
16 A Not unusual at first. 
17 Q Why don't you describe what you saw? 
18 A Urn, these two boys or two guys walking 
19 down the street. They were kind of out in the 
20 street, but not all the way out. They weren't quite 
21 to the yellow line. 
22 Then I kind of stepped back a little 
23 bit. Then for some reason I looked again and I saw 
24 the police car pull up, and he said something to the 
25 boys. They, obviously, said something back because

1 you could see the motion of their hands, but I 
2 couldn't hear anything because my window was closed. 
3 Then the boys kind of went on, walked 
4 on and then he backed up, the cop backed up, the 
5 policeman backed up. 
6 Then, I guess, I'm not sure what else 
7 happened after that, but I could see the one boy, 
8 the shorter one, he kind of stepped a little bit 
9 past the window of the police car. It was actually 
10 an SUV, it wasn't just a regular car, but the bigger 
11 guy was standing at the window, near the window of 
12 the car. And I could see the top of his head and I 
13 could see their hands moving. And so it seemed like 
14 they were kind of, I guess, tussling through the 
15 window of the car. 
16 Then the boy, the guy broke loose and 
17 began to go down the street and that's when the 
18 policeman got out of the car. Then he proceeded, 
19 the boy was ahead of him and that's all I could see. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Because they were past, they were past my 
22 building. See, like my building is here, well, I 
23 couldn't see, I could only see the police car and 
24 him going so far. I could not see after it passed.

1 don't know whether it was three or four because I 
2 really did not necessarily count them, but I knew it 
3 was more than two. Oh, my God. I don't guess, you 
4 know, they were shooting. This had anything to do 
5 with it and I just went on back and started to put 
6 my clothes on. 
7 By that time the crowd of people had 
8 started, people had started to come, not a lot of 
9 them but, you know, I knew something had happened. 
10 So by the time I got out, it was all over. The boy 
11 was in the street and the police was beginning to 
12 put some cones out.

Are they horizontal blinds?

to see what's going on, you know. 
So did you have to move the blinds in 
you to see out the window? 
No. 
Okay. 
Because they were high enough and by me 
high, I can see on the street, so.

9 big guy, he didn't really look that old. The other 
10 one he looked, I don't know, maybe he could have 
11 been just a year or so older than the other one. As 
12 far as the size and the way they were dressed, and

10 there is apartments on each side. There are

13 moved in, there wasn't quite as many males, younger 
14 males in the apartment. 
15 So you see them all day. You just 
16 see them when I'm home, you know. 
17 Q Hanging out, walking around? 
18 A Hanging out, they're walking around, what 
19 is it, they are interacting with each other. 
20 Sometimes they have cars parked, they are sitting on 
21 cars. I don't really pay a whole lot of attention. 
22 Q Sure. 
23 A It is just that particular morning, which 
24 I do every morning, I just look out. It is really

5 Northwinds from that way, that is the way he was 
6 coming. 
7 He had no signal light on and then he 
8 just stopped. He didn't stop all the way because he 
9 still had, his car was still running, he just had, 
10 like you just know how you pull up to somebody and 
11 you switch to put on your brake and he was talking 
12 to them. 
13 Q Okay. So you observed the vehicle come up 
14 to the boys and you said it looked like they're 
15 talking. You could see their hands moving and 
16 stuff? 
17 A Yeah, that's all I could see was movement.

15 A He catches up with them, by then the boys, 
16 the little one, he's kind of away from, he was not 
17 at the window, he's kind of walking away. The 
18 bigger guy was having some kind of interaction with 
19 the cop.

21 you described that you could see their hands going 
22 back and forth?

A 
Q 
A 
Well, he was out of my sight.

At the window, yeah.

6 that?

10 other and the boy walked away.

Q

2 Q Okay. So at this point you see the 
3 officer get out of the patrol car?

1 and get out. 
2 
3 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
So I'm saying whatever time it took him to 
4 get, because if you are sitting in a vehicle you 
5 have to step out, get out, and he come out kind of 
6 almost at a run. He come out kind of fast. 
7 Q And at the time that the officer came out 
8 of the vehicle, did he then move in the direction 
9 that you saw the boy moving in? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh, that same direction. 
At the time that officer got out of the

Could you still see the big boy?

19 gun? 
20 A I could see his left side and I don't 
21 know, I'm not sure if he had anything, but he held 
22 his hand like he had something in his hand and I 
23 could not see it.

1 something? 
2 A He might have had something, but I did not 
3 see it. It can if you get out you have something in 
4 your hand, you carry in your hand a little bit 
5 differently, so I don't really see it then. 
6 Q Okay. Did the police officer then move 
7 quickly or return out of your sight? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Out of my sight. 
And then how long after you lost sight of 
10 police officer did you hear some gunshots? 
11

A 
Q 
13 been four? 
14 A 
A couple seconds. 
You said it was more than two, could have 
It could have been. It was kind of 
15 shocking to hear it because it was such a minor, 
16 thought minor thing that I saw before the gunshots. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 A And so I know I heard pow, pow, pow, and 
19 then I just said, you know, how you say it, I don't 
20 believe this, can't be a shooting back here.

22 at this point are you still looking out the same

1 window and you saw the officer and the bag boy out 
2 of your the window? 
3 A I moved away from the window. 
4 Q When did you move away from the window? 
5 A After the policeman went down and when I 
6 heard the shot. 
7 Q Okay. But before then had you been at the 
8 window the whole time, from the time when you first 
9 saw the boys talking to the time you moved away, or 
10 did you like step away and get your cell phone and 
11 then come back to the window? 
A No. 12 
13 Q You were at the window the whole time that 
14 you said you were watching this. Do you understand 
15 my question? 
16 A Yeah, I understand your question. What 
17 I'm trying to say was, when I saw the boys, I kind 
18 of backed away from the window a little. When I 
19 kind of just look back, I didn't really go back, I 
20 kind of look back and that's when I saw the police 
21 car. That's the only time I'm at the window until 
22 the cop moved.

1 A Yeah. I just had on some shorts and 
2 things in the house, so I couldn't go out like that. 
3 I just put on my pants and went out. 
4 Q You went outside? 
5 A Yes. I'm hearing the shots and then I'm 
6 seeing people, you kind of could hear too, you know. 
7 I heard the shots and then I said, I saw people, you 
8 could hear people by then, people were kind of 
9 screaming. 
10 So I could hear them through the 
11 window. So that's when I put my clothes on to go 
12 out. 
13 Q Okay. So other than the shots, you 
14 couldn't hear anything that was going on between the 
15 boys and the officer? 
16 A No. 
17 Q You didn't hear anybody yelling or say 
18 anything that maybe you couldn't make out?

Q 
No. 
And so when you left your apartment, did 
21 you go down to Canfield Drive, did you see the boys? 
22 A I had just come out of my apartment, still 
23 in the apartment lot. I had never left the parking 
24 lot where I could see. I wasn't going to get too 
25 close to that, so I stayed back.

13 one that was in the confrontation. He was putting 
14 out some cones, put some cones down to make sure

12 from other apartments on the other side. 
13 Q Did it appear to you that the people that 
14 were beginning to gather, were they becoming angry 
15 or agitated? 
16 A They were more, more like in shock. You 
17 just don't see a body laying in the street every 
18 day, you know. There were some people there that I 
19 think must have been family members that were real 
20 upset. I didn't see anybody who was actually

5 area know that you've seen this, do you talk to your 
6 neighbors about it? 
7 A No, and the reason for that was that's the 
8 only reason why I agreed to make a statement was, 
9 and that's why we did it the way we did it. He said 
10 it was the safest way. He didn't want to put me in 
11 harms way was for me to go to the FBI rather than, I 
12 told him I wasn't going to talk to Ferguson.

2 of give you a background on me. I don't have a lot 
3 of interaction with policemen. 
4 I think I've gotten a ticket twice 
5 and they were completely out of my area. Anything 
6 else, I just don't get involved with them. I do 
7 what I'm supposed to do, try to follow what I'm 
8 supposed to do. I work, I work most of the time, 
9 I'm gone five days a week, most of the time working. 
10 And when I'm home, when I'm there in that apartment, 
11 I stay in my apartment, I mind my own business. 
12 I know of maybe one or two of the 
13 neighbors that's in the apartments. I speak to them 
14 and I keep going. 
15 But I sit in my apartment, I see the 
16 police coming down the streets. I have a problem 
17 with them doing 50, 60 miles an hour coming down the 
18 complex where you've got children and people walking 
19 all the time and it is five, six, seven, eight cops 
20 and they're all speeding down the street. Less than 
21 five minutes later you see them coming back. You 
22 see them, they all pull up into the parking lot and 
23 there will be, oh, I don't know in these funny 
24 looking suits and playing cards.

2 know which one, and then they come back out. I 
3 mean, it is just a lot of things that go on. 
4 Frankly, I'm really not use to this. 
5 This is my first experience with an apartment. I've 
6 always lived in a house and never lived in an 
7 apartment before. 
8 And the things that go on, you know, 
9 make me kind of leery of the police because they, 
10 when they come in, if you come to go get in your 
11 car, get back in your apartment, get back in your 
12 apartment. When there is really nothing going on. 
13 If you got a warrant for somebody to 
14 go in or something, you know, it is for you to talk 
15 to people. The little bit that I did do interaction 
16 that I did see with them, the tone, the way they 
17 talk to you, the way they approach you. 
18 I had a couple of them knock on my 
19 door because they was looking for somebody. You 
20 knock on my door and you want me to give some

2 that opinion? 
3 A Yeah, they were, I mean, they were just 
4 like, you know, I mean, it is like tussling with 
5 each other. And he was like, I guess, he was trying 
6 to get away and he finally was able to break away 
7 and that's when he walked away. 
8 Q Okay. It appeared to you that the police 
9 officer was actually holding onto Brown as he was 
10 trying to get away? 
11 A Yeah, he was holding, I mean, they was 
12 tussling. They were just tussling. And it was like 
13 one was trying to hold the other, you know what I'm 
14 saying? 
15 Q I do. And at the time that you were

Okay. 
He was a big guy and when he broke loose, 
3 he just like went at a fast pace, but not in a total 
4 run. 
5 Q I understand. And he was going in the 
6 opposite direction of the officer? 
7 A Right. Same direction he was going when 
8 the policeman approached him. 
9 Q Approached him, okay. And then you saw 
10 the officer get out of the car and I think in your 
11 statement you said it appeared that he was running 
12 after Brown and his gun was drawn, does that sound 
13 familiar that his gun was drawn?

When he got out of the car, he jumped out, 
20 I could see him when he was getting out of the car, 
21 okay. When he got out of the car, wherever his gun 
22 was, he must of had to reach for it because when he 
23 got out, I could see his hand on this side and then 
24 when he got so far, I could see the beginning of the 
25 gun, like he had something in his hand.

6 Q Right. 
7 A And they were trying to hold her. There 
8 was just a lot of people, a lot of people and a lot 
9 of screaming. 
10 Q Can you show us on the map where you saw 
11 his body fall? You didn't see it fall, but where it 
12 was when you came out? If you can. Can you tell on

Q Okay, all right. 1

3 end is the dividing line where my view gets, but not 
4 there, but you know what I'm saying? 
5 Q I do. 
6 A As you come out of my apartment you come 
7 there, right there, I can't see after that. 
8 Q Okay. 
9 A That's the end of, like the apartment ends 
10 there and then I can't see any more from there. I 
11 have to come out of my apartment and come to the end 
12 of the parking lot and look down the street. 
13 One thing you mentioned that it was such a Q 
minor 14 incident to end up, I think, in somebody being

18 
dead? 
A 
Q 
A 
Right, it was. 
Tell me what you mean by that? 
Here is two guys walking down the street. 
19 They're in the street. The policeman pulls up and 
20 says something to them. They say something back, 
21 they start to walk away. Then the police backs up 
22 and then there is a confrontation between him and 
23 one of the guys. Then the next thing you hear is 
24 shots. 
25 I mean, it was such a small incident

1 if they were in the streets, he didn't want them in 
2 the streets and he told them get on the sidewalk. 
3 That should have been it. 
4 Q And if they didn't obey and get on the 
5 sidewalk, then what are your thoughts? 
6 A What are my thoughts? 
7 Q Yes. 
8 A I don't think he should have died from it, 
9 he could have arrested him.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
Jaywalking, and that's basically what it 
12 was if that's what it was. It just seemed to me it 
13 was just such a, I mean, that's just my point of 
14 view that it was such a minor incident, the boys 
15 didn't have a gun, there was no big deal on just 
16 jaywalking and just to me it seems a waste of life 
17 to me, that's just me.

(By Ms. Alizadeh) Ma'am, I totally 
22 understand and agree that as we sit here now some 
23 several weeks later and we have learned a lot about 
24 what happened that day, it does seem like a waste,

1 questions I have for you though is that when you 
2 were looking out your window, you said you could see 
3 the hands going back and forth? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q Do you remember telling the FBI agents 
6 that you could see Michael Brown's hands in the 
7 police vehicle? 
A In the window of the vehicle. 8 
9 Q Right. Inside the vehicle, past the 
10 window. If the window were up, the hands were 
11 inside, correct? 
12 A Yeah, if they're wrestling, there's 
13 confrontation, I'm in your window, my hands are in 
14 your window. 
15 Q Okay. From your vantage point, because 
16 when Sheila asked you if you could see Michael Brown 
17 going for or trying to grab the officer's gun and 
18 you said no. 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
I didn't see that. 
So what I want to clarify is, are you 
21 saying that didn't happen because you could see what 
22 was happening, or are you saying, you know, I can't 
23 tell what was going on in the car so I didn't see it 
24 go on, but I don't know what happened? 
25 A

1 could see was their hands going back and forth. 
Q Okay. 2 
3 A I never saw anybody reaching for a gun or 
4 reaching into the car to try to get his gun. In 
5 that case from what I could see, if he had to, if he 
6 reached into the car, he would of had to have been 
7 in some kind of way, no way he could have stood up 
8 straight and reach in the car without me seeing it. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And all I ever saw was the top of his head 
11 and them wrestling through the thing. I never saw 
12 him bend to reach in the car, I never saw the 
13 policeman reaching in his gun holster to get his 
14 gun, all I saw was them wrestling at the thing. 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Now, but that don't mean that I didn't, 
17 there's something I could have missed something, but 
18 I did not see anything beyond that. 
19 Q Okay. When you first saw the boys, and 
20 you just said today you really don't recall what 
21 they were wearing in particular. You could see 
22 their hands when they were walking, right? 
23 A

1 hands, no. I don't recall seeing anything in their 
2 hands. 
3 Q And now, I mean, we know today, we know, 
4 and nobody is disputing that Michael Brown, we know 
5 he did not have a weapon, okay. I'm not trying to 
6 imply that he did when I ask you these questions, 
7 but when you saw him, you couldn't tell if he could 
8 of had a weapon in a pocket, in a waistband, from 
9 your vantage point you wouldn't be able to tell 
10 that, would you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
And once he ran out of your sight, and if 
13 you're here and this building right here, this one 
14 right here, once they run past a certain point, you 
15 can't see beyond that building to what happens, 
16 right? 
17 A No. 
18 Q And so whatever happened after they ran 
19 out of your sight, you can't say one way or another 
20 what happened; is that right, is that fair to say? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Fair to say. 
Okay. So at the time, and today I know we 
23 know a lot more today than, obviously, people knew 
24 as it was going on. But at you sit here today, I 
25 know you said it just seemed like such a minor

1 incident, the officer should have arrested him for 
2 jaywalking? 
3 A No, no, that's what I'm saying. I was 
4 just saying in the real world or in a good scenario 
5 what I saw just seemed like such a minor thing for 
6 it to end up the way it did.

Just seemed such a waste. I'm not saying 
11 what happened when it got past me because I can't 
12 testify to that, I don't know anything about that. 
13 Q And exactly what was happening inside that 
14 car, you really couldn't tell? 
15 A No, and when I made the statement to the 
16 FBI I told them that. I could not see inside the

25 weapon?

1 A No, but then if I'm looking at you, there 
2 might be some things that I don't see. 
3 Q Uh-huh. 
4 A Some things that my memory don't record. 
5 I'm not going to say what did or did not happen. I 
6 can only tell you what I saw. 
7 Q If, I'm not saying this is true or not, 
8 I'm just asking you to think about this. If the 
9 officer had drawn his weapon and he was holding his 
10 weapon closer to his, the door. In other words, if 
11 he has a right handed holster, and then if he had 
12 removed a weapon and had it closer to the door, 
13 would Michael Brown have been able to, given what 
14 you were judging from his height and from what you 
15 saw where his head was and everything, could he have 
16 touched or reached the weapon if that were the case? 
17 A Well, I guess if the policeman had the gun 
18 up in his, up high enough where he didn't have to 
19 bend to get it or to move his body to get it, I'm 
20 assuming that could have happened, that could 
21 happen. I don't know that. 
22 Q And I think that, I don't want to imply 
23 that you are saying it did or did not happen because 
24 I think it is clear that you don't know.

1 Q And that's fair, but when you said you 
2 didn't see him, it couldn't have been like he was 
3 reaching for his gun, are you basing that assumption 
4 on if the officer still had the weapon in his 
5 holster on his right hip, you never saw Michael 
6 Brown go far enough in the vehicle to actually 
7 remove, try to get the gun off of his right hip, 
8 would that be fair to say? 
9 A Yeah, that would be fair to say. I can 
10 say that, that I didn't see that. 
11 Q Okay. But if the gun were already out of 
12 the holster and maybe being held across the 
13 officer's body, is it possible then from where 
14 Michael Brown was, that he could reach the gun 
15 without having to lean in the way you would of 
16 thought he would have to lean? 
17 A Could be. If I was in the same position 
18 and you could see me and he put it up high enough 
19 for me to do it within arms reach, I guess I could 
20 do it to. 
21 Q And, again, I'm not saying one way or 
22 another, I'm just asking you because I think you 
23 made certain assumptions when you were saying he 
24 couldn't reach the gun and that's based upon you

Q

Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I know you all have a lot 
5 of questions. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Just one thing. My question 
7 wasn't could he reach the gun, was it did you see 
8 Michael Brown struggling with the officer over the 
9 gun? 
10 A 
11 
12 
13 
14 
No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: 
MS. ALIZADEH: 
MS. WHIRLEY: 
MS. ALIZADEH: 
That's my question. 
I understand, Sheila. 
I was making it clear. 
I didn't know if she meant 
15 that didn't happen because I saw, I could see it and 
16 it didn't happen, or if her answer was I didn't see 
17 that. 
18 A Well, see what I was saying when I say 
19 that I didn't see him reaching in the car, I did not 
20 see that. All I saw was them tussling at the 
21 window, I never saw him reach in, or anything like 
22 that. 
23 Now, that's not saying that what you 
24 said about the gun as far as the policeman was 
25 concerned that it was in a different position, but

1 when the question was asked of me was, did he reach 
2 in to try to take the cop's gun. And I said, no, I 
3 did not see that. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I think that's, and 
5 these are all just points we are trying to clarify. 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm absolutely not trying 
8 to imply one thing or the other. So questions? 
9 Did 
10 you ever at any time see him stick his head inside 
11 the police car? 
12 A No. 
13 When you, 
14 the first time you saw the two guys walking and the 
15 police approaching them and you say you saw the 
16 police drive away and proceeded on or the young man 
17 proceeded on. When the police came back, could you 
18 tell if he came back in a speedy way or did he just 
19 back up normally? 
20 A What happened was, he said something to 
21 the boys. The boys said something to him. The boys 
22 proceeded to walk away. The policeman must have 
23 thought for a second, he backed up to go back to 
24 where they were. 
25 That's what happened. I mean, he

1 didn't speed up any because they only had gotten a 
2 few feet from him when he decided, when I guess he 
3 wanted to have some more to say to them, he just 
4 backed up. 
5 Okay, thank you. 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 When you saw 
8 Michael Brown's head on the top of the SUV, do you 
9 know if he was wearing anything on his head? 
10 A I think he had a hat on, a cap or 
11 whatever, you know. 
12 
13 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Ma'am, I'm just asking you 
14 if you recall when you talked to the FBI agents, and 
15 these were two women agents, right? 
16 A Right. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you remember telling 
18 them that you saw, and I'm talking about when the 
19 vehicle backed up, that you saw the vehicle jerk and 
20 back up a short distance? 
21 A Yeah, he did. Cause when he backed up he 
22 jerked, like he put his foot on the brake or 
23 something. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: I was trying to clarify 
25 when you were asking about and I wanted to know what

1 you meant about that. 
2 A If the policeman probably wanted to say 
3 something, he didn't want them to get away. So what 
4 he did when he put it, just when he backed it up, he 
5 just put on his brakes real hard, real fast and the 
6 car kind of jerked. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: From your position, did it 
8 look like he came close to hitting the boys or did 
9 his vehicle contact either boy when he backed up? 
10 
11 
A I didn't see that. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
12 You 
13 said you don't know if you want to continue to live 
14 there any more. Do you feel it is because of the 
15 police or because of the residents and the danger or 
16 everything?

18 Okay. 
19 A I've got a lease and I can't move right 
20 now. I mean, my family's having major problems. 
21 Yeah. 
22 A There's a lot of things that make me want 
23 to move. Too many young people, too much riffraff,

8 She had previously talked to the County

10 is a statement that was done yesterday, I believe, 
11 at FBI headquarters. I can't be sure, but the 
12 statement is being taken by, the questioning is 
13 being done by , who is the attorney for the 
14 Department of Justice. You have heard her voice on 
15 several statements. You will also hear the voice of

17 attorney who you probably heard his voice on several 
18 statements. 
19 And there is also an FBI agent who is a 
20 female who is a female who pipes in a couple of

3 The statement lasts an hour, and hour 40

11 can you just rundown what you saw and experienced on 
12 August 9th?

14 start from where I started at QT? 
15 MS. Well, yes, I know you stopped 
16 at the QT, but you were on your way somewhere to 
17 begin with? 
18 I was on my way to visit a 
19 friend from high school that I thought lived off 
20 Florissant, but turned out lived in Florissant.

1 lost, this is before I had my GPS. I stopped at the 
2 QT. 270 is up here and I stopped at the QT and I 
3 asked for directions. And I didn't follow them very 
4 well, instead of making a right out of QT, I made a 
5 left. And I realized I went the wrong way, so I 
6 made another immediate left. 
7 But then I seen the apartments, my friend 
8 lived in an apartment. I thought, well, maybe I was 
9 in the right spot after all. 
10 And I went down that street and I passed 
11 two streets and then a parking lot and went into the 
12 second parking lot, which is technically the same 
13 one because it loops around a building. And I 
14 pulled in there and I made a left and I parked there 
15 and then I walked back out in front of that building 
16 to ask for directions. 
17 MS. Okay. 
18 And then that's when I seen 
19 the officer's SUV for the first time, it is a bigger 
20 vehicle, for the first time. And he was talking to 
21 two African-American gentlemen. 
22 And then he started to leave and then he 
23 put the car in reverse and said something, and I did 
24 not hear what was said. And then the next thing I 
25 know, the heavier set African-American was in the

1 car from approximately the waist up. And then I 
2 heard the gun go off, I didn't hear any kind of 
3 conversation. I heard noises, but not what was 
4 being said. 
5 I heard the gun go off, I only remember 
6 one gunshot. The skinnier African-American took off 
7 running and the heavier set one that they call Mike 
8 Brown stood up, and I seen him pull his shorts up 
9 and take off running. 
10 The officer got out of the car and had his 
11 left hand on the left side of his face and the gun 
12 in his right hand. And his right hand was shaking 
13 and he was stumbling from one foot to the other, and 
14 I don't know what he said. All I heard was, or I'll 
15 shoot. 
16 And then that's when Michael Brown, the 
17 heavier set, turned around and face-to-face with the 
18 officer and he had his hands out extended like this, 
19 or whatever, kind of like, you know, what are you 
20 going to do. 
21 
22 
MS. Okay. 
He wasn't saying anything at 
23 that time that I heard. And then the officer had 
24 his gun, was drawn and pointed at him, and that's 
25 when Brown started to charge, you know, kind of like

3 
MS. And your hands are clenched. 
Right, his hands were 
4 clenched at this time. He was slightly bent, but 
5 not much. It was kind of like a football charge 
6 not, you know, and then that's when the gunshots 
7 started. 
8 I don't remember the sequence or the 
9 order. I know that the gun went off a couple of 
10 times and then stopped and then went off again. 
11 And then when the last gunshot went off, 
12 which was in the head, that's when I started to get 
13 freaked out and I got in my car and I left. As I 
14 was leaving, I couldn't go out the same parking lot 
15 I had come in, they had, that was all blocked. So I 
16 zigzagged through the parking lot and I popped out 
17 the third one over here, and I made a right and went 
18 through the neighborhood. 
19 I got lost in there for about 20 minutes, 
20 but I ended up on a street that goes in a complete 
21 circle and then I made a right and popped out on a 
22 side road next to QT, which is where I asked the 
23 person at QT again where the nearest highway was. 
24 MS. So let me go back and ask you 
25 some questions I have.

15 you said you ended up by an apartment complex. You 
16 thought it was your friend's apartment complex, what 
17 made you think that? 
18 Because she had said she 
19 lived in apartments right off Florissant. And I 
20 thought she meant right off Florissant, she meant in

4 I grabbed a black checkbook

6 MS. Did you get convicted of 
7 anything? 
8 Yes, because my dad, even 
9 though it was an accident, it is still my signature

7 He was just kind of driving up next to him.

9 ask this guy for directions or was your attention 
10 diverted to the police car? 
11 I started to ask him, and 
12 then I lit a cigarette, and then my attention became 
13 drawn to the police car. That's why I had to ask 
14 directions again at QT. 
15 MS. Was the guy you are talking to, 
16 was he watching was going on also?

15 prosecutor. A good witness is somebody who is 
16 truthful. And that's all it takes to be a good 
17 witness, right, nobody should be a professional 
18 witness, right. Because we just ask about what we 
19 see going on in our daily lives. 
20 I kind of want to get that out of your

9 yourself, saw. You could tell there was some sort 
10 of interaction, correct? 
11 Correct. I didn't realize 
12 that the officer was even an officer. When I first 
13 pulled in, or whatever, he was coming this way, I 
14 guess, and I never even acknowledged that he was an

4 and I passed and there was a lot of people standing 
5 right here, I just pulled in right away. It wasn't 
6 until I got out and walked this way, or whatever,

7 doesn't really go too far, just a few rolls of the 
8 tire, or whatever. And then he comes back, or 
9 whatever, you know, comes and backs up. And Dorian 
10 and Michael Brown, Brown walked up to the car and 
11 words were exchanged and then Brown entered into the 
12 vehicle from the waist up.

1 was here on the sidewalk and the officer's car was

5 driver's side? 
6 Correct.

5 After the gun went off, I did say damn and then I 
6 said shit, and then I got really nervous. 
7 MS. I don't need a litany of curse 
8 words you used. I just kind of want to understand 
9 your reaction to what is going on. So you see, you 
10 said lunge in and from how far down his body? 
11 To about his belt, naval. 
12 MS. Okay. And that's when, and 
13 your reaction was one of, I guess, surprise, right? 
14 I had never seen anybody 
15 treat an officer like that way before. 
16 MS. What was Dorian doing at the 
17 time? 
18 At that time he punched the

20 and he punched it with his wrist, something gold

16 to Michael Brown, Michael Brown is by the door, was 
17 the door open or closed?

10 MS. So there is a gap --
11 There is just enough of a 
12 gap that you could see the heavier set one's fist

11 MS. What sorts of pauses? 
12 I don't remember the 
13 sequence, but I know that there was at least what 
14 seemed like a lifetime, but it was probably just a 
15 few seconds between up until the last two shots I 
16 mean, the shots kind of went boom, boom, four almost 
17 right in a row it seemed like, but then there was 
18 just enough of a pause and it was just, he wouldn't 
19 stop. 
20 MS. What was he doing? 
21 He was still going after 
22 him, he was still charging, he was bent down more. 
23 MS. And we're talking about the 
24 heavy set guy? 
25 Correct.

25 those shots hit?

15 standing on the sidewalk, correct? 
16 Correct. 
17 MS. So what did you do, did you 
18 turn to the guy in the green shirt and say anything? 
19 No, I just left, but I was 
20 stuck in that parking lot. 
21 MS. Did you go right back to your 
22 car. 
23 No, I went directly back to 
24 my car. Not the spots that were up against the

1 He reappeared real close to 
2 that guy in the green as I was leaving the parking 
3 lot because when I was in the parking lot, I backed 
4 up this way with my rear end towards the heavier set 
5 body and I started to go this way, and he was like 
6 right there at that time, he had just reappeared. 
7 MS. So how much time had passed 
8 from the time of the final shot and to the time that 
9 you saw this kid reappear? 
10 15 seconds, 30 seconds. I 
11 guess. I don't know. It is in 20, 30 feet for me 
12 to get over to my car. 
13 MS. Okay. Did you notice him 
14 changing his shirt? 
15 He had taken his shirt off 
16 and he had drawn it over his left shoulder.

18 or someone that looked like him?

3 don't remember because I don't remember when they

5 MS. What about the officer that 
6 fired the shot, after he fired that last shot, what 
7 did he do?

12 did he do, what were his actions?

17 MS. He fired the last shot, you saw 
18 the big guy fall to the ground. 
19 Correct. 
20 MS. And then what do you remember 
21 about the officer? 
22 Nothing really. I mean, he

1 about what you saw? 
2 I talked to my ex-husband,

9 he's on like three or four different medications.

12 Almost immediately after 
13 because I gave him step by step instructions on how 
14 to get there and everything that happened. 
15 
16 
MS. What do you mean? 
I told him everything. And 
17 the first thing he said was, you know, better not 
18 tell nobody.

21 anybody to cause any problems for the

5 you have the internet? 
6 Yes. 
7 MS. Do you look at the news at all? 
8 I did for about the first 
9 week and then it drove me nuts and that's all there 
10 is. 
11 MS. Did you consider reporting what 
12 you saw to either St. Louis County or the FBI, it 
13 took you a while to come forward? 
14 It's been a long time. I 
15 didn't consider it, not really at first. 
16 MS. Why? 
17 Because I didn't want 
18 anything to do with it. In my opinion, and this is 
19 just my opinion, I felt like the officer does his 
20 job and it just kept going on, and on and on and on, 
21 and it was like. 
22 MS. Yeah, well, I guess this is my 
23 question. You said you were (inaudible) you know 
24 where the attention was?

1 name and which one was which. 
2 MS. So not only was there a lot of 
3 attention nationally and all of that, there was 
4 actually riots going on and not far away from where 
5 you live, right? 
6 Yeah, I -- I knew, I heard 
7 about them. 
8 MS. My next question is right when 
9 you came in earlier, you know, from your dad to come 
10 in and do the right thing and that's why 
11 There is a difference. 
12 MS. All right. So explain it to 
13 us. 
14 You do what's right and 
15 that's what ultimately made me come in. But at the 
16 time I just, I mean, at the time I just didn't want 
17 to be in the middle of it. I still don't want to be 
18 in the middle of it. 
19 MS. I don't think nobody ever does 
20 no matter what the investigation, right, whether it 
21 gets media attention or not. But so -- so giving 
22 what you're saying where your dad, you know, tells 
23 you and all of that and doing the right thing, but

1 I didn't say it didn't dawn 
2 on me, I mean, yeah, because it's, you don't get 
3 into the middle of an officer and his job. Do you 
4 know what I mean? Does that make sense? 
5 MS. I understand what you are 
6 saying, but yet 
7 That's what finally broke me 
8 was the fact that it just kept going and going and 
9 going. Every time you logged onto Facebook or any 
10 of the news websites, that's all there was. Nothing 
11 existed but Ferguson.

13 call St. Louis, that's what you did, right, you 
14 called St. Louis County too, right? 
15 Correct. 
16 MS. So what prompted you to call 
17 them? 
18 I actually called a few 
19 times before that and then I guess I made a comment 
20 that went too far.

4 done his job and that, you know, he had been hit. I

16 Probably within the first 
17 day or two, well, Tuesday, so one, two, I believe 
18 the first three or four days. 
19 MS. This is why I'm confused. 
20 Because first you are saying you didn't really 
21 consider reporting it, but yet you were calling 
22 information out and then commenting. So tell me

4 The situation is scarry.

7 It is not the environment 
8 that I grew up in.

the day I got 
there by 
at five. I grew up right 
and that's where 
14 I spent my whole childhood, 
15 It was just different, you know. 
16 I remember the day I got stopped for 
17 jaywalking when I was 13 and the officer threatened 
18 to turn me over my knee and take a belt to my rear 
19 end, and that was just the way times were back then. 
20 And we didn't dare tell them no, it was yes, sir, or 
21 we caught it, you know, we got it. If we got in

1 MS. You don't think there is any 
2 repercussions for their actions, for anyone's 
3 actions. 
4 What do you mean? 
5 MS. Well, you said an officer 
6 stopped you for jaywalking and if you did something 
7 wrong, you respected it. But if you got in trouble 
8 there, you are getting in trouble at home. 
Right. 9 
10 MS. And you're saying that's

1 MS. And you're not alone, that's a 
2 common feeling, like I said, for anybody that ever 
3 witness's something. You have to spend the time 
4 talking to police officers as well as prosecutors. 
5 You guys are nice, but you 
6 make me nervous. 
7 MS. I'm glad we are nice. Why do 
8 we make your nervous? 
9 Police make me nervous, and 
10 you are higher than the police, that makes me a 
11 little extra nervous. 
12 MS. We are trying to find out what 
13 your motivation might be. As prosecutors, 
14 especially, we have to try to figure out what kind 
15 of case we have, if we can put a case together. 
16 When we speak to witnesses, everybody has a reason 
17 why they say something whether they're telling the 
18 truth or they have other motivation behind it. 
19 So when we have somebody who is telling us 
20 what you are, takes you five weeks to come forward, 
21 we just want to understand what was going through

14 in and tell them that, and not really have to get 
15 involved. 
16 And then the next day I would pray and I 
17 would go like, I can't do that. Cause if I go in

2 it, or I don't know, I kept going back and forth. 
3 But when I pray, I'm not one of these, my ex-husband 
4 is Catholic. I'm not one of those, you know, the 
5 rosary and the cross and the holy water. You know, 
6 I lay in bed at night and stare at the ceiling and 
7 just talk.

9 decide it was actually time to come forward? 
10 Just seeing my dad. Not 
11 seeing him physically, I mean, he's deceased. 
12 
13 
MS. Okay. 
Just remembering that he, 
14 you know, you do what, you do respect. That's it, 
15 end of the line. You can screw up in life, we're 
16 human, but you are to respect the law, you respect

1 really asked and we agreed that we would get back

3 Does she know at all about 
4 this, about the shooting? 
5 I didn't tell anybody except 
6 for my ex-husband. 
7 Why did you tell him? 
8 I had already told my 
9 ex-husband and he told me not to tell anybody and 
10 then I never told anybody after that. I mean, I 
11 live right next door to several county officers and 
12 I never told them either so.

2 Correct. 
3 Was she the same year as you 
4 in school? 
5 Yes, but I had been held 
6 back a year, so technically she would have been a 
7 year younger. The way my birthday fell, I should 
8 have graduated when I was 17, but because I was held

1 So can you describe again how 
2 you left the complex after the shooting? 
3 Yeah. When I left, I went 
4 first, second entrance, I went from here and went 
5 over this way. I don't know, I'd have to look at a 
6 map because I don't remember, you know, zigzag 
7 because I popped out in the third parking lot is how 
8 I popped out. 
9 You said something about a 
10 circle that you went around? 
11 Right, well, I went to the 
12 right and then I know I went to the left, and then I 
13 went down a bunch of different streets and I ended 
14 up on the street that went like this. 
15 Okay, a circle. 
16 But you can drive around it 
17 and if I remember correctly, it was a parking lot, 
18 like you can park, but you drive around it. And 
19 then there's some buildings right here and I turned 
20 that way and then I made a left and that street 
21 dropped me off on the side of QT. 
22 Here is the problem that we 
23 have. 
24 That's what I remember.

1 the apartment complex from the direction that QT WAS

3 Right. 
4 And you pulled out of the 
5 lot and then you saw all of this? 
6 Well, I couldn't, I'm sorry, 
7 what? 
8 And you saw all of this that 
9 we've talked about, right. You go back to your car 
10 and then when you went to leave there, did you turn 
11 the opposite way of the way you came in or did you 
12 go back the way you came in? 
13 I couldn't go the way I came 
14 in. 
15 Why is that? 
16 It was blocked. 
17 From the police incident, 
18 the shooting incident?

22 
23 
Right. Here is the building 
and the entrance and another, you know, you had the 
parking lot here and here, or whatever, and building 
right here. And the officer's car was here and the 
heavier set Brown was like here, there was no 
24 getting in and out of this parking lot.

1 the parking lot was past where the body was and 
2 where the police car was, so you had to go the 
3 opposite direction of the way you came in? 
4 Right, I had to go out, I 
5 popped out over here in this third parking lot. 
6 Uh-huh. 
7 Or whatever .. 
Okay. 8 
9 Well, you couldn't go in or 
10 out. You couldn't go back the way that you came 
11 into the apartment complex; is that right? 
12 I couldn't go back to the 
13 street QT was on, no. 
14 Okay, that's what I'm asking. 
15 So you couldn't go back the way that you came. So 
16 you went the opposite direction 
17 I went into the--
18 You went further into the 
19 complex? 
20 Correct. 
21 And then back there you were 
22 able to find a way out onto the street where QT is. 
23 Right, correct.

1 I remember the circle drive. 
2 I don't know all the different streets I took. 
3 Because I zigzagged through there for about 15 or 20 
4 minutes going up and down streets. I remember a 
5 couple that dead end into parking lots and you go 
6 down it and just dead end into a building, and then 
7 I would turn around and go back. 
8 You never came back there, I'm 
9 sorry. 
10 MS. I'm sorry, you said dead end 
11 into a building, what kind of building? 
12 Apartment building. If you 
13 go down and you make 
14 MS. How many story apartment? 
15 I don't even know. I just 
16 turned around. 
17 MS. It was at least two or three 
18 stories? 
19 I just turned around. I 
20 went down to that stop and I made a left and then I 
21 know I made the first left and that's where I 
22 couldn't go. Because I had to turn around and I 
23 went back and I went, I don't know where I went.

1 At that point, yeah, they 
2 all look the same to me. I don't know, I just 
3 wanted out of there. But I didn't go back to the 
4 street that QT is on the same way I went. I ended 
5 up way over here. 
6 MS. I just want to explain to you 
7 a little bit, you understand that part of what we do 
8 here is we have to evaluate, you know, basically 
9 every statement a witness gives us, correct? 
10 
11 MS. 
Correct. 
So part of us doing that is 
12 just why we are going through that with you is just 
13 saying, okay, you were here and turned around and we 
14 know you were here. 
15 Because sometimes people will say how does 
16 she know what happened she actually was never there, 
17 she doesn't live in the area. What we are trying to 
18 establish right now is that you, in fact, were

1 able to get out that way without going back the way

3 Correct. 
4 There is no way out that 
5 way, that's the thing. We've got investigators who 
6 have been up there plenty and know all of those 
7 streets and --
8 Yeah, there is because when 
9 you go around that thing, there is buildings and 
10 buildings and you go right through that parking lot. 
11 Uh-huh. 
12 And it pops out on a street 
13 that goes along the QT. 
14 MS. Right now, here is kind of a 
15 map of the area. I think that's the circle you are 
16 talking about, here is Canfield Drive, here is the 
17 way-- you can't get, there is a blockade here and 
18 there is a blockade there. The only way to get out 
19 once you go down this street is to go all the way 
20 down here. 
21 And it has been that way a long time, long 
22 before August 9th and it is that way today. You 
23 cannot get out through that circle.

she'd answer, what would you expect to say? 5 
6 Were you expecting? I don't 
7 know if she'll remember if she was actually, because 
8 it was nothing, we had her address, I told her I was 
9 going to try to stop by. You know, did she really 
10 expect me at a given time on that day? I don't 
11 know. But she will be able to tell you that she

2 wearing? 
3 Heavy set, green shirt with 
4 braids. 
5 MS. Okay. So you know before 
6 had mentioned there were things we were having 
7 trouble kind of putting the pieces together and in 
8 your previous statement when you spoke to the guy 
9 you described this guy as wearing a, the same color 
10 wife beater shirt. 
11 That's what Dorian Johnson 
12 had on. 
13 MS. Okay. You also said that the 
14 guy that you were talking to was wearing that wife 
15 beater shirt. 
16 Okay. I don't, I know he 
17 had a green shirt and he was heavy set. 
18 MS. Okay. 
19 I might have talked to 
20 somebody else. 
21 The searches online that you 
22 may have seen, does this look familiar to you at 
23 all? Would you have seen that if you were 
24 searching, does that look familiar to you?

2 Because I was trying to 
3 figure out if that was the gold thing that I had 
4 seen. 
5 Okay. 
6 That's what I asked you before, 
7 right, that's what I was wondering if you used-- if 
8 you looked or used the article. 
9 I'm sorry. 
10 MS. Did you look online to remember 
11 things? 
12 Yes, yes, ma'am because I 
13 remember the gold thing and the officer's car. I 
14 remember it coming off, a gold thing coming off 
15 Dorian's right wrist and, yeah, I remember looking 
16 at this. 
17 Okay. So what did you search 
18 to get to that article? 
19 I have no idea, Mike Brown, 
20 Mike Brown shooting or Mike Brown shooting in 
21 Ferguson. 
22 I think I searched the name Darren Wilson 
23 a couple of times because I was trying really hard 
24 to figure out how

17 I haven't read any of that,

19 pictures to try to figure out which way I left the

23 showed --

3 Well, no, like this, I know, 
4 yes, I looked at that, I looked at that multiple

6 the gold thing that I seen. 
7 What we are trying to 
8 determine here, and you're not in any kind of 
9 trouble.

11 That's fine. You are not in 
12 any kind of trouble. What we need to be able to do 
13 out of fairness to you and out of all of the 
14 witnesses to this, okay, is just to be able to tell 
15 you is what you are telling us doesn't add up in 
16 with some ways, okay. 
17 Okay. 
18 And that's our concern. 
19 Listen, I know this has been all over the media, 
20 it's been all over the internet. And you talked 
21 before about how you did go back, and you know, it 
22 is human nature to want to go back and look at 
23 what's going on about this thing, okay.

1 you were very much sort of emersed in going through 
2 this on the internet, or whatever. And you're hear 
3 and you think you are trying to help, but maybe that 
4 you didn't see everything that you said that you 
5 saw, okay. 
6 And it is important for us to be able to 
7 determine who is telling us exactly what they say

9 put those together. 
10 I'm not 100 percent sure 
11 where I was parked. 
12 That's fine, we're not 
13 concerned about where you were parked. 
14 Refresh my memory on where I 
15 was parked and the MapQuest that you showed me, when 
16 you do get down and get close, I used that to help 
17 me figure out how I got out of there. 
18 Right, that's our concern is 
19 because on a map it looks like you could get out the 
20 way that you've described. 
21 I don't know how I got out. 
22 Yeah, I understand that. 
23 Those are details, okay. The point is are you

5 were said or anything like that. I remember, can I 
6 look at this? 
7 MS. Yeah, go ahead. 
8 I remember looking at this 
9 because I was trying to figure out if that was the 
10 gold thing, what it was. And then I remember 
11 watching that a half dozen times. 
12 Did you comment on this 
13 article, did you send any comments? 
14 When this first happened, I 
15 made comments for the first few weeks. Some were 
16 really obnoxious, some were pretty vulgar and then I 
17 realized that that is not the Christian thing to do.

1 few times. I was not, I was having a hard time 
2 dealing with what I did see and trying to remember 
3 things that I knew I seen, but I couldn't remember. 
4 That's what we're worried 
5 about. It is understandable you said you have 
6 memory problems, if you are trying to fill in the 
7 gaps by using the internet and reading things, is 
8 that possible. 
9 That is possible. I know 
10 what I seen though, I know that I seen the 
11 altercation in the car and I know I seen the shot 
12 that killed him. 
13 But a lot of what you told 
14 us today you've actually had to fill in the blanks 
15 because your memory problems by looking at the 
16 internet. 
17 As far as where I park and I 
18 how I got in and out, yes. And where I was 
19 standing, I remember being in front of that building 
20 and the only thing I remember is there was a fire 
21 hydrant right across the street, that I do remember. 
22 MS. Did you notice any other cars 
23 in the area, any other people standing around? 
24 When I left over here, when 
25 I was over here, there was a really nice yellow car,

Out of the third parking lot? 
Correct. 
I'm talking about in the 
10 area, a lots of people were in that area and you 
11 said you saw lots of people around, but other than 
12 that guy you were standing right next to as you are 
13 watching this scene unfold, did you see cars on 
14 either side of the street because it is noon, 
15 there's going to be cars there that want to come 
16 through. 
17 There was that and then over 
18 here there was a white car, I think it was a 
19 two-door and then there was that really nice yellow 
20 car. I remember thinking it was really sweet. 
21 MS. Right behind the white car, 
22 two-door car. 
23 No, I remember the yellow 
24 car being in the third parking lot. Like it just 
25 had pulled in.

4 left into the parking lot, the guy was just right 
5 there. 
6 Q So just some stranger that you approached 
7 and said, what did you ask him?

10 believe is , but I'm not sure.

12 A He asked to see the address. I showed it 
13 to him. He said, are you sure, he asked if I was 
14 sure that that was where I was trying to go. He 
15 said he hadn't heard of it. And I asked him, told 
16 him I had done a couple of turns and asked him which 
17 way 270 was.

When you turn, when you pulled out of the 
10 QuikTrip, did you pull directly onto West 
11 Florissant? 
12 A It is not that side street, I turned onto 
13 the busy road. I guess that was West Florissant. I 
14 don't know the street names. 
15 Q All right. And then you found yourself, 
16 you turn left and you were, where were you when you

7 A No, I went down past a few streets first. 
8 Q Are there apartment buildings or 
9 businesses or restaurants or do you recall? 
10 A I don't remember. I just remember I went 
11 down and went past a couple of streets on, I believe 
12 it was the right-hand side. 
13 Q Why would you go past those streets, why 
14 wouldn't you turn around, you turned onto Canfield 
15 so that you could turn around and go back to 270, 
16 didn't you? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q You didn't turn around when you had an 
19 opportunity to turn around? 
20 A I don't -- yes, correct. I don't make U 
21 turns in the middle of the street and I don't pull 
22 into people's driveways. When I realized the 
23 apartments were there, originally, I thought I was

3 do? 
4 A He got out of his car and he had his left 
5 hand on his face and the gun in his right hand and 
6 when he stood up, he was wobbling from his left foot 
7 to his right foot. He said something, I don't know 
8 what he said. All I remember hearing is the word 
9 shoot. I didn't hear any other words before that. 
10 And he had his hand on his gun and he was pointing 
11 it right at the larger of the African-Americans.

1 Were you posting racist 
2 stuff before this incident? 
3 No, ma'am. 
4 So you have never made 
5 any kind of racist remarks? 
6 No, I've never posted on 
7 Facebook any racial remark. 
8 But you have made racist 
9 remarks? 
Yes, ma'am. I don't like to 10 
11 be considered racist. I try very hard. And I know 
12 for a fact my children are not, but does it sound 
13 with my language and my behavior that I am racist? 
14 Yes, ma'am, but it's not something I approve of, if 
15 that makes sense. 
16 Honestly, no, but that's 
17 okay. You were going to see an African-American 
18 friend, you said was a very good friend? 
19 Correct. 
20 The weeks following this 
21 incident, you didn't call her until the next day, 
22 but in your recorded statement you said that you 
23 called her that day to tell her that wouldn't be 
24 coming by. So which was it, you call her that day 
25 or the following day?

2 have to have my phone records checked. 
3 Okay. You said that you 
4 have some short term memory problems? 
5 Yes, ma'am. 
6 In that you turned left 
7 instead of right, did you get confused? Do you get 
8 your left and your right confused because of your 
9 short term memory problems or you not remembering 
10 which way he told you to go? 
11 I wasn't remembering which 
12 way he told me to go. 
13 Okay. In the FBI 
14 statement you said you saw an apartment complex, you 
15 turned into the apartment complex because you 
16 thought maybe this was where you miraculously found 
17 out where your friend lived; is that right? 
18 No, I turned into, I turned 
19 left on that into there. 
20 Okay.

5 attempting to go in there and turn around. 
6 Okay.

10 directions. 
11 Okay. I think we 
12 established earlier that you passed up several 
13 streets where you could have turned around? 
14 Correct. I passed up two 
15 that I remember.

18 You admit you get 
19 confused?

1 first opportunity to turn around. Can you help me 
2 understand why that is? 
3 Because I don't make U turns 
4 in the middle of the street and I don't pull into 
5 people's driveway. 
6 Right, you said that, but 
7 you said there were several streets that you passed 
8 up. Could you not have turned around in some other 
9 streets? 
10 I only remember two. 
11 Okay. Two instead of 
12 three? 
13 Right. I only remember the 
14 two streets and then when I come around the corner, 
15 I was looking for a parking lot. 
16 I do have other 
17 questions, but I'll ask one more. You said you 
18 could not see inside the car very well? 
19 Correct. 
20 But then you said you 
21 could see the heavy set man's hands moving up and 
22 down and you could tell he was punching him, and 
23 this is according to what you said here and your 
24 recorded statement. right?

1 So even though you can 
2 see in the car? 
3 I could not see the officer, 
4 no, because the larger of the two, the heavier set 
5 one was blocking the view of the officer. 
6 Okay. So how do you know 
7 he's being punched? 
8 The hand was going up and 
9 down.
