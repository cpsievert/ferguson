GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME X 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
Page 5 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is October 6th. This is 
5 Kathi Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office. 
6 Present is Sheila Whirley with the prosecutor's 
7 office. All 12 grand jurors are present here today, 
8 as well as , the stenographer, who is taking 
9 down and recording matters that are going on today 
10 in the grand jury. 
11 It is about 8:39 a.m., and my 
12 understanding is we are going to go to about 2:30 
13 today, correct? We have a witness that's here 
14 already this morning. Her name is 
15 We heard from her husband, 
16 last week. 
17 She wanted to come in first thing in the 
18 morning, so we're going to go ahead and have her 
19 testify first, and after her testimony, we will 
20 listen to the statement of and 
21 We didn't get a chance to do 
22 that last week. 
23 I have a witness scheduled to be here at 
24 1:00 this afternoon. So her name is 
25 and she is the fiancee, or girlfriend, I can't

3 So we'll probably listen to her statement 
4 in the morning if we have time. We probably should, 
5 and then at this point, we might be done for the day 
6 after testifies. 
7 Sheila and I have been talking about 
8 trying to schedule your time and make use of your 
9 time as best we can. We're running into the issue 
10 now that some of these witnesses are not very 
11 anxious to come in and meet with you. And so we're 
12 going to probably need to be searching for some 
13 people and giving them written invitations to appear 
14 before you. 
15 So I'm trying desperately to get your day 
16 scheduled tomorrow, so I know you are here until 
17 6:00. We want to be able to keep you busy all day. 
18 And then we've got, I've got some 
19 witnesses lined up, and then on Thursday we have 
20 witnesses lined up too, but as of right now, I don't 
21 have necessarily the whole day filled. So we'll try 
22 our best. And it may be that we go ahead and call 
23 some other witnesses. 
24 We have lab people, we have police 
25 officers yet to testify who, obviously, would be

2 kids don't walk on the sidewalk, they just don't. 
3 They have sidewalks but they don't walk on them.

3 Q Okay. Anything else that you noticed 
4 about them that drew your attention? 
5 A No, I mean, like I said, it was a Saturday 
6 morning, I mean. They was just walking in the 
7 street and I made a note to my husband, why don't 
8 they just get on the sidewalk, and that was pretty 
9 much it. He didn't say anything, I didn't say 
10 anything, we didn't blow, he just kind of went 
11 around and did what we needed to do. 
12 Q Okay. Were they walking shoulder to 
13 shoulder or one in front of the other, do you 
14 remember? 
15 A I mean, I guess side by side, you could 
16 say. I mean, just, I mean, when you see kids 
17 walking and there was only two of them, so it wasn't 
18 like it was a group of children, they were just 
19 walking down the street.

1 Q And so did you, after you parked your car, 
2 what's the first thing you noticed going on around 
3 here? 
4 A Well, once we were going up the steps, the 
5 police car came down going towards West Florissant, 
6 and I said to my husband, oh, he's going to stop 
7 them and tell them to get on the sidewalk. 
8

Q 
A 
Urn, and we just kind of proceeded up 
Now, earlier you had pointed to this one. 
See, I'm not used to looking at these. So 
12 once we got on the landing, the police officer had 
13 stopped and said something to them. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Now, could you hear what he said? 
No, I'm assuming, I'm not going to say he 
16 said, but from the activities that we saw from the 
17 porch, he stopped and the kids, the children 
18 stopped. I don't know what he said, I didn't hear 
19 that, we were too far away to hear. I'm just 
20 assuming that he said the same thing I had said to 
21 my husband, get on the sidewalk.

23 apartment unit, those are exterior stairs, correct?

It may have been maybe a minute.

He said whatever he said, then we heard 
12 two gunshots. He was still in the car, the boys 
13 were outside of the car. Well, before we heard the 
14 gunshots, I don't know what he said or what they 
15 said or what the conversation was, but the car was 
16 headed west on Caddiefield, on Canfield, and he, I 
17 guess, backed the car up and was at an angle. 
18 Q Let me ask you this. The time when he 
19 paused that you thought that he might have been 
20 saying, hey, get on the sidewalk, or what you 
21 assumed he might have said, was that after he backed 
22 up?

24 
A

No, it was before. 
Okay. So he stops, pauses for a little

7 they had, the officer backed the car back, but it 
8 was at an angle and that's when we heard two 
9 gunshots inside the vehicle. 
10 Q Okay. So when the officer, I think you 
11 said east, but you meant west, right? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
I'm sorry. 
He's going westbound and then he puts it 
14 in reverse, backs up, and he's at a little bit of an 
15 angle in the street? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Did you hear tires squealing or screeching 
18 or anything? 
19 A No, it wasn't like it was a chase or 
20 anything. I mean, he just, I mean, I don't know 
21 what happened, they exchanged words, I'm quite sure, 
22 and, you know, you just, I think he kind of whipped 
23 the car in reverse so it was at an angle.

Q

Okay. 
Not a full complete angle, it was no

2 Q When the first time the officer 
3 encountered the boys, were the boys on the driver's 
4 side of his car or on the passenger side? 
A 5 All the way on the driver's side. 
6 When he reversed it around to where it was Q 
at an 7 angle, are the boys still on the driver's 
8 side? 
9 Still on the driver's side. A 
10 So from your vantage point where you were Q 
11 standing, are you looking at the driver's side of 
12 the car or the passenger side? 
13 A Driver's side. Well, at the driver's 
14 side. We were on that side of the vehicle, I 
15 couldn't see what was on the other side of the car. 
16 Q Okay. So then after he comes back, 
17 reverses and stops his car at an angle, what do you 
18 see happen between the boys and the police officer? 
19 A I didn't see, I just didn't see anything 
20 actually happen. We just kind of heard the two 
21 gunshots and I told my husband, oh, no, he's 
22 shooting, they're shooting. 
23 Q At this point did you know who was 
24 shooting? 
25 A No.

1 on the driver's side, he kind of hid on the back 
2 side of the car and that's when he ran, I'm hoping 
3 I'm saying this right, there is a grassy area, he 
4 kind of ran over this way, he kind of ran this way. 
5 Q Okay. So he's running now east down 
6 Canfield? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And can you tell at this point if he's 
9 injured? 
10 A Well, he ran this way and then he kind of 
11 got into the grassy area and he kind of stopped and 
12 looked down at his hands. I'm assuming there was 
13 blood, but he looked down at his hands and then he 
14 turned back around, he turned back around and 
15 started going back towards the police officer. 
16 Q Okay. Let's stop now.

16 Q Were you or your husband or anyone else 
17 that you can hear yelling anything, that you recall,

5 just kept shooting, he just kept shooting. And I

15 just, like I said, he turned around and he looked at 
16 his hand and he turned around and he did like this 
17 and he kept walking, he just kept walking toward the 
18 officer, he didn't stop.

20 A He was just standing there, he wasn't 
21 moving, he wasn't running, he wasn't doing anything.

23 was not even walking towards the officer? 
24 A No. He walked and then it was like as he 
25 was shooting, he just started falling like a domino,

2 Q Okay. So explain to me, I don't want to 
3 be confused. Why you didn't think it was necessary 
4 for him to shoot those last rounds of shots at 
5 Michael Brown?

7 that's just me being a mother, this being a child, 
8 he was not charging at him, he did not have a weapon

22 don't want my child there. When I say that, it is 
23 
24 
just that my son is years old, he's

2 beams on. The police officer pulled him over and he 
3 stopped, he was not disrespectful, he was not 
4 belligerent, he pulled out his insurance, his 
5 license and the police officer told him, young man, 
6 I'm just giving you a warning, turn your high beams 
7 off. And my child was so afraid, the officer wanted 
8 to know if he needed us to come and pick him up. 
9 So he respects the authority, 
10 however, I don't want him to be in a situation where 
11 he has to second guess anything that my husband and 
12 I have told him about, what he's supposed to do when 
13 he's encountered by a person of authority. My child 
14 has a 3.5 GPA. He's never been suspended, he's 
15 never been in trouble, but it is always that one 
16 incident. 
17 When he leaves the house, he's only 
18 to have two people in his car outside of his sister.

20 well, but we try to train him and teach him to do 
21 things that he's supposed to do. But that's not 
22 always the case. And when you have other people in

25 that. Can you describe that a little?

15 should have stopped.

4 going to ask you if it was your husband or child 
5 that was the officer, would you feel the same way?

7 Okay. Thank you. 
8 A I have to be perfectly honest, this has 
9 changed his life, it has changed this child's 
10 family's life, everybody's life and it went from 0 
11 to 100. And honestly, I think it was just something 
12 that could have been thought through a little bit 
13 more because his life has changed, no matter what 
14 happens, both of them. It has changed a lot of 
15 lives.

17 want to make sure that I heard you correctly. You

19 We will be playing a couple of recorded statements. 
20 I thought, and Sheila and I decided, we 
21 talked, probably make more sense to play 
22 s statement first since she just testified 
23 and be fresh in your mind. And the first statement 
24 is about, well, it is 54 minutes and 32 seconds. It 
25 is just under an hour.

8 1:00 or whenever you are done with your lunch break. 
9 So he will give his testimony after lunch. I'm 
10 going to try to get somebody else. He won't take an 
11 hour and a half, but I will try to get another 
12 police officer or someone else to come in to round 
13 out the rest of the afternoon.

4 THE COURT: It is Monday, October 6th, and 
5 I'm back in front of you mainly because I'm always 
6 thinking about you and I have a little bit of 
7 information that I want to share with you. And I 
8 hope that what I'm here to say will also guide you. 
9 Urn, I received some information that some 
10 of you, and by the way, I have no names, and you are 
11 not at the principal's office right now, you have 
12 not been called to the principal's office. I want 
13 to assure you about that, but some of you may have 
14 done some independent investigation or some 
15 research, and I'm here to caution you about that. 
16 Your job, as you know, when I told you 
17 when you started here will be to listen to the 
18 evidence that you're going to hear and then at some 
19 point, you're going to be deliberating. 
20 It's very important that you all come to 
21 deliberate, that you are all considering the same 
22 evidence. You will each have thoughts about the 
23 evidence you've heard, you will each have opinions, 
24 but the very important thing to give the decision 
25 you make credibility and value is that you are all

1 considering the same information and evidence. 
2 And so I'm here to caution you do not go 
3 out and do independent research and investigation. 
4 If there is something you want, you tell the 
5 prosecutors. They will go and get that for you. 
6 And if they can't get it for you, they'll tell you 
7 why they can't get it. 
8 Ask for anything you think you need to 
9 reach the decision you're going to be reaching, and 
10 I can't caution you enough about that. 
11 I think of you often and I think of you 
12 because, and I told you this before, I told you at 
13 the beginning and I still tell you this, you are the 
14 face of our community. This decision is important, 
15 you are good people. You collectively are our St. 
16 Louis County. We have St. Louis County, that's our 
17 community here. 
18 You are, you are the face of our 
19 community. Your decision will be the decision of 
20 the community because you good people have listened 
21 to all of this evidence and then reached your 
22 decision. 
23 The decision you reach will be thoughtful, 
24 it will be thorough, and it will be based on as much 
25 evidence as you ask for and as can be brought to

1 you. 
2 And just so you are deliberating and 
3 talking back and forth, just so you all know, you're 
4 thinking about the same evidence. That's why it is 
5 so important that you not do this independent 
6 research, independent investigation. 
7 So I'm going to ask you to please, if 
8 there's something you have, it has to be shared 
9 collectively. I'm going to ask you from this point 
10 forward, do not go forward and do anything 
11 independent. Ask the prosecutors for it. 
12 I guess I've stated what I really wanted 
13 to state, but I have such faith in you. I think 
14 you, no matter what the decision is, your decision 
15 is going to be the result of a well thought out and 
16 conscientious approach to considering it. That's 
17 what is provided for in the law. You're going 
18 through a very hard task at this time. 
19 But when you go through that task, you 
20 should know at the end of the day, and I will know 
21 at the end of the day, you have done everything that 
22 is provided for under the law in our justice system 
23 when grand juries sit, and you have done everything 
24 that has been asked of you as a citizen of St. Louis 
25 County.

1 So my caution to you is if there is 
2 anything you want, you tell these prosecutors, they 
3 will get you that information. And if they can't, 
4 they will tell you why, ask them why. You are 
5 certainly free to do that.

12 questions, I am going to follow the law in that 
13 regard. I believe I have followed the law up to 
14 this point with regard to any questions from the 
15 media, I will continue to do that, but when you do 
16 independent investigation, I worry that you keep, 
17 that you may expose yourself to dangerous 
18 situations, and you may create a situation where 
19 people start talking about you and reporting they've 
20 seen this, they've seen that, and it may lead to 
21 more problems than we could ever imagine. 
22 So please keep your research and

24 yourselves safe and please know that you are the

15 a break and use the restroom and whatever, or chat 
16 amongst yourselves. And then when the food gets 
17 here, we'll give, you know, a good amount of time to

2 Q Could you please state your name and spell 
3 it for the court reporter? 
4 A 
5 Q Urn, can you please tell me how you're 
6 employed? 
7 A I am a police officer with St. Louis 
8 County Police Department, assigned as a firearm and 
9 tool mark examiner in the crime laboratory. 
10 Q And so you originally received your 
11 training to be a police officer; is that right? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
When did you become a police officer? 
In early, I'm sorry, 1991. I became an 
15 officer commissioned and hired by St. Louis County 
16 and have not worked for any other departments. 
17 Q So as a police officer after your 
18 graduation from the academy and during your training 
19 with the academy, you learned how to use firearms, 
20 correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then at some point you went from being 
23 a uniformed officer to having this specialized area 
24 of tool marks and firearms examiner, correct? 
25 A That's correct.

1 Q So can you explain for the jurors, first 
2 of all, when is it that you went and got your 
3 training for that? 
4 A After four and a half years on patrol, I 
5 went into the Crime Scene Unit and was in the Crime 
6 Scene Unit for six and a half years. 
7 So approximately 2002 I was assigned 
8 in the crime laboratory, trained under other 
9 qualified firearm examiners, both on the job and 
10 through available training outside the laboratory by 
11 firearm manufacturers, ammunition manufacturers, ATF 
12 training opportunities, FBI training opportunities 
13 and so forth. Completed that training in 2004 and 
14 have been an examiner ever since, even becoming the 
15 supervisor of the section, I think, two and half, 
16 almost three years ago now. 
17 Q 
18 you said? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
So you began in the firearms lab in 2002 
Yes. 
So there's, you had approximately two 
21 years of training before becoming a firearms 
22 examiner? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A qualified examiner, yes. 
Now, to be a qualified examiner, do you 
25 have to have any type of certification or

1 qualification? 
2 A There are opportunities for certification 
3 through an international organization. They're not 
4 required, only a small percentage of examiners take 
5 that opportunity and I have not, so I am not 
6 certified through them, but I have been qualified 
7 both in state and federal courts numerous times as 
8 the expert witness. 
9 Q So for approximately ten years you've been 
10 working solely and strictly as a tool marks and 
11 firearms examiner for St. Louis County Police 
12 Department? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And can you give me an estimate of how 
15 many times you have testified as an expert witness 
16 in that area in state and federal courts? 
17 A I wish I had counted them. Truthfully my 
18 best estimate would be dozens, not 50, but more than 
19 25. 
20 Q Okay. And in those cases, have you been 
21 qualified to testify as an expert in the field of 
22 tool marks and firearms examination? 
23 
24

Q 
Yes. 
So can you explain for the jurors,

3 A Uh-huh. 
4 Q The investigation into the shooting of 
5 Michael Brown. You were looking at firearms and 
6 ballistic materials; is that correct?

8 Q Okay. So while it might be very 
9 interesting to talk about tool marks and what you do 
10 with them, let's skip that part of your expertise 
11 and we'll go straight to the firearms portion of it, 
12 is that all right?

Now, in the laboratory setting at St. 
15 Louis County Police Department Crime Laboratory, are 
16 evidence items submitted to you for you to examine 
17 and test?

19 
A 
Q 
Yes, they are. 
And in this particular case, which is in 
20 relation to St. Louis County Police Department's 
21 Complaint Number 14-43984, were there items 
22 submitted to you for you to examine and test? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So first off, let's talk about a weapon.

1 and examine? 
2 A There was a firearm submitted for my 
3 examination, yes. 
4 Q And I say weapon, I guess that's pretty 
5 all inclusive. The weapon in particular is a 
6 firearm, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And you tested that weapon and compared it 
9 to some other materials that have been submitted to 
10 you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Did you put your conclusions in a report 
13 that you then gave to me?

A 
Q 
I did. 
All right. And I'm going to show you

21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. 
I'm going to pass this around so everybody 
23 can have a copy of that as well. So Officer

1 examination? 
2 A In this particular case, after opening the 
3 package to observe the weapon, firearm, I discovered 
4 that it had what appeared to be blood on it. In the 
5 interest of safety for myself and others that might 
6 handle this firearm after me, I cleaned it with 
7 bleach to kill any biohazards and remove that 
8 apparent blood from the firearm. 
9 
10 
Q Okay. So let's back up now. This weapon 
was submitted to you by Detective is 
11 that correct? 
12 A The seizing detective was 
13 From him it went to a secure vault that they have 
14 access to for dropping off evidence after hours. 
15 That vault is then accessed by Property Control 
16 Unit, and in this case , who is the 
17 supervisor of the Property Control Unit. Removed it 
18 from that vault and brought it to me. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
So what day did you receive that firearm? 
October 11th of 2014. I'm sorry, did I 
21 say October? I meant August, I'm sorry. 
22 Q That would have been a Monday, correct, or 
23 maybe. If the 9th was a Saturday, that would make 
24 the 11th a Monday? 
25 A That sounds correct.

1 Q Can you describe how this weapon, this 
2 firearm was packaged and how you first saw it? 
3 A It was packaged in a box that we have 
4 specifically on our department for the storage of 
5 firearms and it is sealed with evidence tamperproof 
6 tape. In other words, if the tape is torn to open 
7 the package, you can tell by the tearing of the 
8 tape. 
9 And it is also itemized on an 
10 evidence receipt that accompanies that box. So its 
11 submission has some of the case information and the 
12 contents of the box listed thereon. 
13 Q Now, when you received the box, did you 
14 examine it to determine whether or not the tape that 
15 sealed the box had been tampered with? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
It was sealed when I received it. 
Had you noticed, or in any case when you 
18 noticed that there has been a tear in the evidence 
19 tape, would you notify the seizing detective 
20 immediately? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes.

23 still be intact, correct?

1 it was packaged? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Not to my recollection. 
Now, there has been testimony from 
Page 76 
4 Detective , and I'm just going to ask you to 
5 take my word on this, that when he first found the 
6 weapon or first got the weapon I'll say, that it had 
7 been packaged, so to speak. And he described to the 
8 jurors the way that was. 
9 The weapon had been placed in like an 
10 evidence envelope and the magazine and live round 
11 had been removed from the weapon and the slide had 
12 been locked in its back position. Did you see any 
13 evidence envelope with the box that you opened up, 
14 was there anything like that in there? 
15 A Truthfully, I don't recall, however, 
16 that's not unusual. So the answer to your earlier 
17 question anything unusual, no, because it's not 
18 infrequent that that does occur, especially the 
19 firearm being made safe and unloaded and the action 
20 locked up and so forth, that is actually a 
21 requirement of the laboratory that we not have 
22 loaded or unsafe firearms. 
23 Specifically in this case I don't 
24 recall an envelope, but if there was in that box, it 
25 would still be there today.

1 Q Okay. Whatever the condition it was in 
2 was not unusual to you? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q And, in fact, the St. Louis County Police 
5 Department's Crime Laboratory examines firearms and 
6 ballistic materials from any police department in 
7 St. Louis County that would submit them to you; is 
8 that fair to say? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, including federal agencies, yes. 
And I would imagine, and I'm not sure, 
11 would it be fair to say that just different 
12 departments, they may have a different way of 
13 packaging a firearm? In other words, they might not 
14 use the same box that the county uses and so forth? 
15 A That's absolutely true. In fact, that's 
16 why it is not unusual because we have a requirement 
17 that the guns be boxed. It is for a safer storage 
18 and so forth, easier to store. 
19 Those agencies that will use those 
20 envelopes, when they arrive at our lab we will offer 
21 them boxes. It is not unusual to have that envelope 
22 in that box, no matter how they choose to submit it. 
23 Still other agencies will choose boxes very 
24 different from our own. Simply whatever they have 
25 available because then they meet the requirement of

3 
Q 
Detective 
Now, we have also heard testimony from 
that when he seizes a weapon, in 
4 order to package it and submit it for examination, 
5 that he would zip tie through the ejection port of 
6 the weapon in order to prevent that slide from 
7 moving. Did you notice if that had been done in 
8 this case? 
9 A I didn't pay particular attention to note, 
10 but every firearm is required to have a safety of 
11 some sort applied to it for its submission and that 
12 is the most common. And, in fact, when I'm done 
13 examining, I put on the very same zip tie. 
14 Q And then he also testified that he would 
15 use some kind of led identification number seal that 
16 he would put on the trigger guard of the weapon to 
17 mark it, so to speak, or number it. Is that also 
18 something that you use for sealing? 
19 A Absolutely, it's a led tab that has a 
20 steel wire coming from it. That led is manufactured 
21 for our department with our name on one side and 
22 forgive me, our number on one side that is unique. 
23 It is an incremental numbering system on those led 
24 seals. They are unique so they're not repeated. So 
25 that number, when that led wire goes through the

1 trigger back into the led and is crimped on with the 
2 led crimper, it embosses St. Louis County on it 
3 ideally. Then that is a unique number identifiable 
4 to that specific firearm and yes, I am very use to 
5 seeing those. 
6 Q All right. So when you first receive that 
7 weapon and you look at it, did it appear to be 
8 handled properly in your opinion, came to you at 
9 least in a condition that didn't raise any 
10 suspicions with you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
13 weapon is? 
14 A 
Correct, I found it as I would expect to. 
Okay. So can you describe what this 
Yes, it is a pistol. It's made, as you 
15 can see on your copies, by Sig Sauer, Incorporated. 
16 They're located in Exeter, New Hampshire. This 
17 model is a P229 and the caliber of it is .40 Smith & 
18 Wesson. 
19 Again, it is a pistol, the finish I 
20 call black, that's mainly for the color. 
21 Manufacturer's have many different names for their 
22 finishing processes. We don't try to keep up with 
23 those. We simply try to know what color that finish 
24 is. It has six lands and groves with a left twist 
25 inside the barrel, and this firearm has serial

1 number 55B003794. 
2 Q All right. The things that you indicated 
3 just now about the weapon, are those things you can 
4 see in your visual examination of the weapon or did 
5 you have to like actually look through some kind of 
6 device in order to determine that it had six lands 
7 and grooves with a right side twist, I mean, a 
8 left-hand twist? 
9 A That is the interior of the barrel. It 
10 took some lighting to eliminate that. It can be 
11 seen with the naked eye, however, low power 
12 magnification is best. I have an eye loop, it is a 
13 jeweler's loop, it is only 5X, it is not very much 
14 at all. Like a magnifying glass, it is not very 
15 much at all. It makes it easier to see. So I can 
16 look into the barrel and determine the number of 
17 lands and groves and the direction of that twist. 
18 Q In regard to the caliber of the weapon, 
19 what does that mean? 
20 A The number is roughly the diameter from 
21 the raised area of the land on one side to the 
22 raised area of the land on the other side on the 
23 interior of the bullet. Interior diameter, if you 
24 will. 
25 Q The interior of the barrel?

1 A Of the barrel. However, that's not an 
2 exact measurement. There are different tolerances 
3 that the manufacturers have. The S & W after that 
4 number is Smith & Wesson is what that stands for. 
5 They developed that caliber, so .40 Smith & Wesson 
6 caliber is a name of this caliber of ammunition that 
7 this firearm is designed to fire. 
8 Q All right. And when you say that you 
9 cleaned the weapon of blood, did you do any testing 
10 on that to determine it was blood? 
11 A The testing of any blood or search for any 
12 fingerprints if it was necessary is all done before 
13 the firearm comes to me in the laboratory. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Okay.

1 we are issued as county police officers. 
2 Q All right. And so after having cleaned 
3 the firearm, what do you do then to continue your 
4 examination of the weapon? 
5 A I then made note of these observations and 
6 then began to do some more observations and some 
7 simple tests to include determinating the capacity 
8 of a magazine that was submitted with the firearm 
9 and that was 12. 
10 The firearm has no safety, I took 
11 note of that. 
12 Q Is that unusual that a weapon of this type 
13 does not have a safety? Is it manufactured without 
14 a safety or is it somehow removed from the weapon? 
15 A This firearm and many others have internal 
16 safeties and when we speak of a safety, we are 
17 referring specifically to an external safety that 
18 can be applied by the person possessing the firearm. 
19 There are no external safeties on this firearm, but 
20 there was never designed to be. It was not removed 
21 from this weapon, it is simply not present. 
22 Q Okay. And so then you also indicated 
23 there was a magazine submitted with this weapon, 
24 correct? 
25 A Yes.

1 Q Can you describe for the grand jurors what 
2 is a magazine, it is not People or Time, obviously, 
3 but what was the magazine that was submitted to you? 
4 A Some people call it a clip, but it's that 
5 detachable part of the firearm that contains the 
6 ammunition. You can load it with as many as you 
7 like up to its capacity and in this case as many as 
8 12 live cartridges inside the magazine. The 
9 magazine when you desire, when you use your desires, 
10 would seep into that firearm and lock into it and 
11 contain that ammunition. 
12 The firing cycle, it would take 
13 individual cartilages to load and fire from that 
14 magazine. And to continue to do so as many times as 
15 you fire it until the ammunition supply is 
16 exhausted. 
17 Q So the magazine that was submitted to you, 
18 was it empty as submitted to you? 
19 A We receive it in both manners, where it is 
20 loaded and unloaded. I don't remember at the moment 
21 if he unloaded the magazine or not. 
22 Q Do you recall if there were any live 
23 rounds that were submitted with this weapon? 
24 A I did have one live cartridge submitted 
25 with the magazine and firearm.

1 Q So now I called it a round and you just 
2 called it a cartridge. Can you describe for the 
3 grand jurors what you mean by a cartridge? 
4 A A cartridge is the unfired ammunition. It 
5 is a live cartridge where the primer is ready to be 
6 fired, I'm sorry, there is gunpowder contained in 
7 the cartridge case. And the bullet is seated in the 
8 mouth of that cartridge case. Again, it is unfired. 
9 A round is a interchangeable term if 
10 you will, perhaps a layperson's term. It can mean 
11 the same thing, but among fire examiners the 
12 definition of that is a live cartridge. 
13 Q What else did you note about this weapon 
14 that you indicated in your report. You have here 
15 trigger pull SA, not applicable. What does that 
16 mean? 
17 A Trigger pull single action and next to 
18 that is DA, for double action, I put not applicable 
19 because I did not test the different trigger pulls 
20 that firearm has. It is a measurement taken in 
21 pounds. And the reason why I did not report that is 
22 because it can vary. One pull of the trigger might 
23 be 5 pounds and the next one might be 7 pounds. 
24 Unless it becomes a key element in the case, it is 
25 simply too variable to have much meaning to me and

1 for me to testify to it. It is seemingly 
2 unimportant. 
3 Q So in that case where someone says I was 
4 holding the weapon and I barely touched the trigger 
5 might be relevant, but in this case it was not; is 
6 that correct? 
7 A To my understanding, correct. There is no 
8 denial of firing the weapon, there is no question of 
9 how long the trigger pull might have been and things 
10 of that nature, so it was not recorded. 
11 Q And then CYL and CYL rotation, what do 
12 those terms mean? 
13 A CYL is standing for cylinder. And that is 
14 for a revolver type weapon, this is a pistol, so it 
15 does not have that cylinder, so it is not 
16 applicable. 
17 Q All right. And then you described the 
18 barrel length in inches; is that correct? 
19 A That's correct, three and three quarter 
20 inches. 
21 Q And then muzzle trigger length you have 
22 NA, is that because it is a short pistol as opposed 
23 to a long gun? 
24 A That's correct. That's more intended for 
25 the overall length of firearms. Sometimes that

1 length becomes an issue in the application of 
2 statutes. For example, sawed off gun, it has to be 
3 a certain length to be legal. And if it is any 
4 shorter than that, the measurement would have been 
5 taking there. 
6 Q Now, we've described the action of this 
7 weapon or firearm as being semiautomatic. 
8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What does that mean? 
Semiautomatic pistols fire one bullet, 
11 fire one cartridge with each pull of the trigger. 
12 So if you pulled that trigger one time, even if you 
13 hold it back and don't release it, it is only going 
14 to fire the one time. You have to release the 
15 trigger then until it resets internally and then if 
16 you pull that trigger again, assuming you have more 
17 ammunition it would then fire again. 
18 But again, it only fires one time 
19 with each pull of the trigger. 
20 Q Now, you described in this case the 
21 magazine that was submitted to you as having a 
22 capacity of 12 cartridges. Can this weapon, when 
23 the magazine is seated in the handle of the weapon, 
24 can it have more than 12 cartridges and be fully 
25 loaded.

1 A Yes. If you were to seat the magazine and 
2 work the action of the firearm, open the slide, 
3 release the slide, it would feed that top cartridge 
4 from the magazine into the chamber of the barrel. 
5 If you remove that magazine, and you have 11 in it, 
6 if you put another one in it. So it is now again at 
7 capacity with 12, reseat that magazine, you now have 
8 a total of 13 live cartridges available to be fired 
9 in that magazine, I'm sorry, in that firearm without 
10 reloading it again. 
11 Q And you identified the cartridge, the live 
12 round I called it, but the cartridge that you were 
13 submitted, you've listed as one Federal JHP, what 
14 does that mean? 
15 A The Federal is the marketed name stamped 
16 on the head stamp or on the base, if you will. If 
17 you stand that cartridge up on the bottom, it says 
18 Federal, that's who markets that ammunition. And 
19 JHP stands for Jacketed Hollow Point, that is the 
20 style of the bullet that's loaded into that 
21 cartridge case. 
22 Q And the cartridge that was submitted to 
23 you, is this the type and caliber of a cartridge 
24 that could be fired from that weapon? 
25 A It is. I did not note the caliber next to

1 that cartridge because it is the same caliber that 
2 the firearm is designed to fire. Sometimes 
3 ammunition that is submitted differs from the 
4 firearm, but I note when it is different here. And 
5 because there is no such note. I know that that is 
6 a .40 Smith & Wesson caliber cartridge. 
7 Q All right. You also indicated that you 
8 had been submitted five bullets. Can you explain 
9 what is a bullet, how is a bullet different from a 
10 cartridge? 
11 A The cartridge is the combination of all 
12 the elements needed to fire a weapon. The primer in 
13 the cartridge case that contains the gunpowder and 
14 the bullet. 
15 So when you're firing a cartridge, a 
16 firing pin strikes the primer, which is a very small 
17 explosive. So that sets off that explosion, that 
18 miniature explosion sends fire into the open chamber 
19 of that cartridge case where the gunpowder is. 
20 So that fire then ignites the 
21 gunpowder. It doesn't detonate, which means to burn 
22 instantly, it burns rapidly, it deflagrates, which 
23 means it creates pressure. So that pressure that is 
24 created by the burning gunpowder is the same 
25 pressure that pushes the bullet out of that

1 cartridge case through the barrel towards its 
2 target. 
3 Q And then the bullet is the piece that 
4 comes out of the barrel of the gun and is what we 
5 normally think of as a bullet, it is what it shoots 
6 at targets or things? 
7 A Correct. In this case, for example, the 
8 submitted cartridge is a jacketed hollow point 
9 bullet. So that bullet would leave the cartridge 
10 case after having been fired, go through the barrel 
11 of the firearm. It's designed to make minimal, but 
12 contact with the lands and groves in that barrel to 
13 impart spin to the bullet so that when it leaves the 
14 barrel, it's a spinning bullet in flight now. 
15 The purpose of that is if you think 
16 of the analogy of a football, if you throw a spiral 
17 football, it will go farther and more accurately 
18 then an end over end football. It is the same 
19 principles at work here. If the bullet is spinning, 
20 it will go farther and more accurately than 
21 tumbling. That rifling is what gives it that 
22 stability. 
23 Q So the bullet is forced through the barrel 
24 of the gun, what happens to then the rest of the 
25 cartridge?

The energy that pushes that bullet out the 
2 barrel is equal, but opposite on that cartridge 
3 case. And in essence on the gun in the shooter's 
4 hand itself. That's the recoil that you see in 
5 cowboy movies. 
6 That cartridge case after it has 
7 fired that bullet, it is marked in several ways by 
8 that firearm. First, as I mentioned the firing pin 
9 striking that primer will leave a mark. 
10 The pleasure from the firing process 
11 pushing that cartridge case rearward against the 
12 breech of the firearm impresses the contours of that 
13 breach into the surface of that fired cartridge 
14 case. 
15 In this case, speaking of pistols, 
16 the action of the firearm is intended to extract 
17 that fired cartridge case from the chamber. So 
18 there is a little hook on the firearm that grabs the 
19 rim of that fired cartridge case and pulls it out, 
20 pulls it rearward of that chamber as it is pulled 
21 rearward then it is designed to hit what's called an 
22 ejector. It is nothing more than a little piece 
23 that when that cartridge case is pulled rearward, it 
24 hits that ejector to deflect it out of the open side 
25 of that slide of the firearm.

1 So to answer your question in a short 
2 order, after firing the bullet, the cartridge case 
3 is ejected from the pistol and then before the 
4 action closes, it needs the next cartridge from the 
5 magazine to reload it if there is one available. 
6 Q So, what you just described from pulling 
7 the trigger and the firing pin hitting the cartridge 
8 and the bullet being expelled from the gun and the 
9 casing coming out and the next cartridge being 
10 loaded up into the firing position, is that called a 
11 cycle, is that the firing cycle? 
12 A Yes. 
13 Q And that happens at one pull of the 
14 trigger, correct? 
15 A That will happen with each pull of a 
16 trigger on a semiautomatic pistol like this. 
17 Q So it doesn't require someone actually 
18 pulling the slide back in order to cause the gun to 
19 cycle again? 
20 A No, it doesn't. In fact, if you were to 
21 that, you would be ejecting a live cartridge and not 
22 have as much firing capacity because you would be 
23 wasting your ammunition. 
24 Q Can you explain, because there has been 
25 testimony perhaps that when this weapon was fired

1 during the incident of August 9th, that the officer 
2 pulled the trigger on a couple of different times 
3 and the weapon didn't fire. Did you test fire this 
4 weapon yourself?

6

A 
Q

Q 
I did. 
Was it normal, did it fire normally? 
Yes, I noted no defects at all. 
Is there anything that you can explain 
9 that would have happen that would cause a weapon to 
10 not fire the cartridge if on this weapon pulled the 
11 trigger back? 
12 A To be clear, you're asking for speculation 
13 or generally speaking, correct. 
14 Q Sure, right. I know you don't know what 
15 happened in this case. 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I'm just asking you what could possibly be 
18 the reasons that you could pull the trigger and the 
19 weapon wouldn't fire? 
20 A Okay. Sometimes ammunition is simply bad 
21 ammo, maybe the primer doesn't have a priming 
22 compound in it. So no matter how many times you 
23 strike it, it is not going to fire. 
24 Sometimes a firearm might fail to 
25 feed a cartridge from the magazine, so you might try

Page 93 
1 to cycle it and it doesn't feed that cartridge, so 
2 there is no cartridge in it to fire. 
3 There are other scenarios if you are 
4 successful firing one cartridge, but it fails to 
5 extract, in other words, the hook doesn't grab the 
6 rim and pull it out or if it fails to eject and it 
7 pulls out from that hook, but it doesn't eject 
8 before the action closes on it. It might have it 
9 standing to where the open end of that fired 
10 cartridge case pointing up and out of the gun, they 
11 call it a stovepipe, like a stovepipe on the top of 
12 your house. 
13 Another factor might be in some way 
14 the action is impeded during the firing process. 
15 Perhaps unimpeded a firearm and ammunition might all 
16 be in perfect working condition, but if there was 
17 something blocking the action to where it couldn't 
18 cycle freely, then it might cause some of these 
19 other events to occur, especially not being able to 
20 fire after one shot because it wasn't allowed to 
21 cycle enough to feed the next one. There could be 
22 many others. 
23 Q Let me ask you a question. In this 
24 particular weapon, when you fire it, I don't know 
25 that this is the technical term for it, but the

1 hammer, is that a technical term? 
2 A There is a hammer that strikes the firing 
3 pin, yes. 
4 Q The hammer, as you can see it externally 
5 on the gun when you examine the gun, correct? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And when you fire that weapon, does the 
8 hammer come back and go forward striking the firing 
9 pin? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
So if there would be something that would 
12 prevent that hammer from moving backwards and 
13 forward, would that cause the gun to not fire even 
14 though you pulled the trigger, it could? 
15 A Absolutely it could. And that, in fact, 
16 would be a scenario where the action of the firearm 
17 is impeded. Yes, interference with that hammer and 
18 motion of that hammer would prevent the firing pin 
19 being struck and firing that cartridge. 
20 Q And then what about, you know, you've 
21 described, or I did and you also explain to where 
22 the hammer strikes the firing pin, which is 
23 basically on the bottom of the bullet, correct? 
24 A It's inline with the primer of the loaded 
25 live cartridge, yes.

1 Q If there is something that is in between 
2 the hammer and that firing pin, whether it be, you 
3 know, but something that would be between that 
4 action, could that possibly explain why you pulled 
5 the trigger and nothing happened? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q In other words, if a part of your hand 
8 would be in between that firing pin and the hammer, 
9 that could prevent the weapon from firing? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, absolutely. 
And if that were to have happened, again, 
12 pure speculation, but if that were to have happened, 
13 and the weapon would not fire, if that obstruction 
14 was removed between the hammer and the firing pin, 
15 would the weapon then be able to cycle normally

Q

Or would you have to then go ahead and

22 be expected to fire then. It is not true of all

1 that simply from your examination of the weapon? 
2 A In the scenario you've described, no. 
3 Because there are no marks on that live cartridge 
4 for me to observe. In other words, a different 
5 scenario, for example, I gave a bad ammunition was 
6 my first example. If you tried to fire it once and 
7 pulled the trigger again and that firing pin struck 
8 that primer a second time and then fired, I would 
9 note two firing pin impressions and know that there 
10 was more than one attempt to fire it. 
11 But in your scenario, no. There 
12 would be no marks made, I would have no indications 
13 on what evidence was submitted to me? 
14 Q Now, in this case, let me ask you, you 
15 described how the gun was fired from the weapon and 
16 you mention that there are marks left on the empty 
17 cartridge that is ejected from the ejection port, 
18 correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And there is also markings that are made 
21 on the bullet itself as it is forced through the 
22 barrel of the gun, correct? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And can you see those markings using a

A Yes. 1 
2 Q Are those markings made by the individual 
3 weapon that fires that cartridge? 
4 A The answer is yes and no. And if you'll 
5 allow me, let me explain. 
6 Q Okay, go ahead. 
7 A There are what's called class 
8 characteristics. The number of the lands and groves 
9 and the direction of their twist inside the barrel, 
10 as well as the dimension of those lands and groves, 
11 that is determined by the manufacturing. They make 
12 many, many firearms with those specifications. 
13 So you might have one right after 
14 another coming off an assembly line that putting six 
15 left .40 caliber barrels out to be put into these 
16 pistols. And they're going to have those same class 
17 characteristics, they are intended by the 
18 manufacturer. 
19 However, as the tool wears during the 
20 making of that part, and as the gun is used after it 
21 is manufactured and sold, by firing, cleaning, 
22 abusing, misuse, etc., there are microscopic 
23 qualities in that are called individual 
24 characteristics. They're specific. Every one of

1 room would treat it the same way and have exactly 
2 the same microscopic qualities or individual 
3 characteristics in our barrels after a hundred or a

5 Are they unique to the weapon? Yes. 
6 There are some characteristics that I look for under

8 another, from the source of another or to determine 
9 whether or not they came from the same source fire.

On the 11th I had five submitted to me. 
2 And they indeed were observed to be jacketed hollow 
3 point design bullet and .40 caliber, and it had six 
4 land and grove impressions with a left twist. 
5 Q And when we're talking about the five 
6 bullets, these are spent bullets, correct? 
7 A Right. These are fired. They would not 
8 have the lands and groves of the barrel incrust upon 
9 them until they're fired through the barrel, yes. 
10 Q Were you able to determine whether or not 
11 the five bullets that were submitted to you and the 
12 12 casings that were submitted to you, were you able 
13 to draw any conclusions after comparing those items 
14 with the firearm that had been submitted to you? 
15 A I was. In test firing the submitted 
16 firearm, I retained fired cartridge cases and fired 
17 bullets. That's what I microscopically compared to 
18 submitted evidence. I was able to determine that 
19 all 12 of the submitted fired cartridge cases have a 
20 sufficient quantity and quality of those matching 
21 individual characteristics for me to conclude that 
22 they were fired in this firearm. 
23 Q So just so we're clear, the 12 cartridge 
24 cases, they're like we call casings, or what I call 
25 casings?

Yes. 
The hollow kind of left over that gets 
3 thrown out of the ejection port, correct?

5 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And then were you able to, I see here on 
6 page two of your report, you number the bullets as 
7 QB 1 through 5, and then you also reference where, 
8 where they were discovered. Is this information 
9 that you received on the evidence packaging that 
10 each bullet was packaged in? 
11 A It may or may not be on the package 
12 itself, but I get that directly from the evidence 
13 receipt that accompanies that evidence and 
14 packaging, yes. 
15 Q So for QB 1, which is a copper jacketed 
16 hollow point bullet, .40 caliber, you have here from 
17 FPDVEH.108. What does that mean? 
18 A Uh, that is in quotations, because I took 
19 it directly from the evidence receipt. And my 
20 understanding is that stands for Ferguson Police 
21 Department Vehicle Number 108. 
22 Q Okay. And you have here a measure of 158 
23 grams and CSU Number 7. What does that mean? 
24 A The 158 is in grains, we measure in 
25 grains. And the CSU stands for Crime Scene Unit and

1 that Number 7 next to that is their item number. So 
2 seizing detectives item number was given my 
3 laboratory specimen number QB 1. It stands for 
4 questionable, by the way. QB stands for 
5 questionable cartridge case. 
6 Q And so the QB 2, 3 and 4, you indicate 
7 have been from the evidence receipt. It says from 
8 Brown's right side of back, right side of chest and 
9 right side of head. Those are all spent bullets 
10 that were seized by someone else and packaged and 
11 according to evidence receipt, were recovered from 
12 the body of Michael Brown, would that be what you're 
13 indicating? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
It is. 
And then regarding QB 5, it says from 
16 roadway and your information was then that this 
17 bullet was received from a roadway or on the street? 
18 A Yes, I had no further description of a 
19 specific location. Just what I noted there in the 
20 roadway. 
21 Q And so after examining QB 1 through 5, 
22 were you able to make any, draw any conclusion about 
23 whether those bullets were fired from the weapon 
24 that had been submitted to you, the Sig Sauer? 
25 A Yes, I was.

Q 
A 
And what were your conclusions? 
The first one listed specimen QB 1, 
3 apparently from Ferguson police vehicle was 
Page 102 
4 inconclusive. It had enough damage to its surfaces 
5 that I did not have enough of those microscopic 
6 characteristics to match to my test shots to 
7 determine that it came from the same source. 
8 I did not have enough differences 
9 either to think or believe that it came from a 
10 different source firearm. So it is inconclusive for 
11 number one. However QB 2, 3, 4 and 5 had a 
12 sufficient quantity and quality of those matching 
13 individual characteristics in the rifling striations 
14 that we've talked about for me to conclude that they 
15 were indeed fired from this firearm. 
16 Q Now, at a later date you were submitted 
17 another evidence item and asked to compare it to 
18 your QB, what's the gun called? 
19 A QF 1 or the test shots are TB 1A and B, TC 
20 1A and B, compared with my test shots. 
21 Q Okay. Did you make a report after you 
22 examined this additional evidence item?

3 Q 
Page 103 
(Grand Jury Exhibit Number 34 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And Grand Jury Exhibit 
4 Number 34, I made copies of this report for the 
5 grand jurors. 
6 So what was the additional item that 
7 was submitted to you? 
8 A It was a copper jacketed hollow point 
9 bullet fragment. In other words, it was not the 
10 complete whole bullet, it was only part of that 
11 bullet. I note that it was one side of a bullet, 
12 all the way from base to nose. It was part, once 
13 part of a .40 caliber bullet. It had six lands and 
14 groves with a left twist represented and it was from 
15 2909 Canfield, seized on September 3rd of this year. 
16 Q All right. And you examined this QB 6, 
17 your QB 6 and were you able to compare it to the 
18 test shots that you fired from the Sig Sauer weapon 
19 that was submitted to you back on the 11th of 
20 August?

22

Q 
23 from that?

I did make that comparison, yes. 
And what, if any, conclusions did you draw 
It had sufficient quantity and quality of 
25 those matching individual characteristics for me to

1 conclude that this bullet was also fired from this 
2 firearm. 
3 Q And the items that you tested and examined 
4 in this case, did you repackage them and were those 
5 submitted to property control for safekeeping and 
6 storage? 
7 A That is the intended destination and, yes, 
8 I finished my examination, resealed the packages and 
9 put them in our vault on a shelf that is intended 
10 for the evidence to be forwarded to property 
11 control. 
12 Q And just one more thing because I haven't 
13 seen the firearm that we're talking about in this 
14 case, but I recall from other cases I've had that 
15 sometimes the firearm has orange tape on the end of 
16 the barrel, is that still done when you are finished 
17 examining a weapon? 
18 A It is. It's an extra measure. We talked 
19 about the zip tie earlier, I provide the officers, 
20 my department with bright orange zip ties and that 
21 is so it is readily visible to anyone that if the 
22 firearm is handled openly, especially in court at a 
23 later time, that that's highly visible and they know 
24 that it's safe. 
25 I add in my lab when my examination

1 is done, I added, my other examiners we add that 
2 bright orange tape to the barrel as well. It is 
3 nothing more than a visual indicator for you that 
4 what is being handled is safe and can't be fired in 
5 the state it's in. 
6 Q So that bright orange tape I'm assuming is 
7 on the barrel of this gun that was placed there by

12 
Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody have any 
MS. WHIRLEY: I have just a couple. You 
13 want to go first? 
14 No. 
15 Q (By Ms. Whirley) That bullet, the copper 
16 bullet fragment from 2909 Canfield, was that like a 
17 building that it was taken from or would you know? 
18 
19 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: That's the next question. 
I understand it is another apartment in 
20 the area, but where inside that building I don't 
21 have specific knowledge. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) On first page of Exhibit 
23 Number 33, Grand Jury 33, poor condition of residue, 
24 what does that mean? 
25 A When I look in the barrel, I simply note

Page 106 
1 is it clean and free of any debris, is there 
2 residues. I'm not even certain what those residues 
3 might be. Sometimes it is dust from people carrying 
4 it, it gets clothing dust in it, sometimes it is 
5 from firing it. There is residues left behind. 
6 When you fire a cartridge, 100 percent of the gun 
7 powder isn't consumed, there is some partial burned 
8 and some unburn powders, sometimes they're left in 
9 the barrel, sometimes they just fly out of the gun 
10 and left in the nearby area. 
11 Residue is simply that there was some 
12 debris in that barrel, but the barrel itself was not 
13 obstructed. It wasn't heavily fouled with multiple 
14 firings and build up of residues, it was simply a 
15 small amount of residue. 
16 Q Okay. And the grain, like it's 158.0 
17 grain, 177.0 grain, what does that grain mean, what 
18 are we talking about? 
19 A That's a measurement much like grams and 
20 ounces and so forth. 
21 Q Of what, though, what are we measuring? 
22 A That is the weight of the bullet. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So specimen QB 1, I described as a bullet 
25 itself. The full weight of that bullet that was

October 6, 2014 
Page 107 
1 submitted to me was 158 grains. 
2 Q And they're different weights because of 
3 what they went through once they were fired? 
4 A Yes, and they're manufactured in different 
5 weights by manufacturers. Their starting weight 
6 might be, for example, 154 grains, but they might 
7 add weight because they retain wall material if they 
8 were dug out of the wall or something of that 
9 nature. 
10 Or if it is a fragment, you might 
11 only have part of the full weight of the bullet. 
12 Sometimes that weight helps us determine a caliber, 
13 it didn't really come into play in this scenario. 
14 Q The internal safety, what is that on this 
15 weapon, you said it has an internal safety? 
16 A Basically what I mean is the parts in the 
17 firearm are designed so it cannot be fired unless 
18 you pull the trigger. If you drop it, it's not 
19 going to fire. If you hit on the hammer, you know, 
20 with something, it's not going to fire. It's 
21 designed not to go off unless you pull the trigger 
22 of that firearm. 
23 Q So this weapon was fired 12 times; is that 
24 correct, based on your examination? 
25 A For there to be 12 fired cartridge cases

Q

Q 
12 individual times? 
At least, yes. 
Is that the difference between a 
7 semiautomatic and an automatic? 
8 A Yes, an automatic you could hold the 
9 trigger back and it will continue firing until you 
10 release the trigger. So a fully automatic firearm 
11 might fire every cartridge available to it with one 
12 pull of the trigger, but this is not that kind 
13 weapon.

1 mean, this is your report, is that some 
2 determination you made? 
3 A No, actually, that is some of the, as I 
4 mentioned earlier, some of the case information that 
5 is provided to us on the evidence receipt that is 
6 submitted with the evidence. That case information 
7 is entered into our laboratory system, so different 
8 areas of the lab know what evidence they have to 
9 examine and so forth. And it is auto populated into 
10 our reports. 
11 So it was submitted, again, on the 
12 evidence receipts that the offense is an assault on 
13 a law enforcement officer. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. You had nothing to 
15 do with that being determined? 
16 A That's correct. Now, we will often get 
17 receipts from the same incident that might have 
18 different offenses listed. We, there's no real 
19 rhyme or reason to figuring out which one is 
20 accurate because we're not determining what the 
21 charges might be. So most often we go with what is 
22 either most commonly submitted or what is first 
23 submitted.

11 We 
12 heard previously about this stovepiping, and how it 
13 didn't appear that there was any. Would that have 
14 to be taken off, would it have to be repaired for 
15 that gun to fire again if that was there? 
16 A Good question. No, there is no physical 
17 repair needed for that. Basically the fired 
18 cartridge case becomes an obstruction to the action 
19 of that firearm. And a practiced user of that 
20 firearm can clear that because it's not permanently 
21 trapped. It is just kind of pinched in place. So 
22 if you pull the slide back and release that 
23 pressure, it can fall out or be caused to fall out. 
24 And then there is no impairment to the action. So 
25 if you let the slide go, the firearm would then

2 Is that the only type of 
3 reason that that firearm wouldn't go, or whatever, 
4 that you would be able to see? Like you always talk 
5 about if something obstructing like a hand or piece 
6 of whatever, the stovepiping is the only thing that 
7 you would be able to examine, it is not necessary 
8 for you to be able to tell exactly what happened and 
9 say it would be able to be fired, am I explaining 
10 myself correctly? 
11 A I think I understand your question. Is 
12 there any circumstances where a firearm wouldn't 
13 function that I could tell, is that basically what 
14 you're asking? 
15 That's right, that you 
16 couldn't tell, you couldn't say no, that firearm 
17 didn't get stuck. 
18 A No. 
19 There is no possible way 
20 that it would happen that way? 
21 A I could not, you posed a good question. I 
22 can't think of a scenario where I could prove that 
23 something did not happen in the firing of the 
24 firearm.

2 
3 
A Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: If the, in the firing of 
4 the weapon the cartridge has stovepiped and you said 
5 it kind of gets caught in that ejection port and the 
6 ejection port has a door to it, correct? 
7 A There's an opening in the slide called the 
8 ejection port, but not a door per se that closes on 
9 that. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. But the cartridge 
11 gets caught in between something, correct? 
12 A Basically the barrel itself where it's 
13 supposed to feed into, it can get caught against 
14 that and then when the slide closes on that, that 
15 ejection port is what might hold that fired 
16 cartridge case against the barrel to where it is 
17 kind of standing up out of there. 
18 Q If that were to have occurred, could you 
19 look at that cartridge casing and see marks on it 
20 that might indicate that it had been stuck in the 
21 gun that way? 
22 A And that's where I was thinking the answer 
23 might take me, but is it possible? Yes. However, 
24 because those marks are unpredictable, there may be 
25 marks on a cartridge case that I can't determine

1 their origin. 
2 So while it very well may have 
3 happened and there may be marks from being a 
4 stovepipe, it's also quite possible that it is not 
5 something that I could conclusively say were from a 
6 stovepipe simply because ammunition in a pocket with 
7 keys is going to get marked. Ammunition thrown in a 
8 drawer is going to roll around. I mean, they get 
9 marked in so many ways, same as anybody's jewelry or 
10 anything else that we have with a metal surface, it 
11 is going to have scratches and so forth to it. 
12 And it's not in a uniform or

15 other examinations and sampling before it gets to 
16 me. So by the time I'm receiving it, all of that

1 If that was to happen, 
2 would that be, would it come out as a bullet or does 
3 it come out as a spent casing? 
4 A Good question. It could happen both ways. 
5 If the cartridge is fired and extracted out of the 
6 barrel and then it attempts to eject it out of the 
7 firearm, but it gets caught and trapped before it's 
8 able to clear that ejection port, you would have a 
9 fired cartridge case and it looks like a chimney or 
10 a stovepipe if you will, but if for some reason, and 
11 sometimes it is just random and there is no even 
12 reproducing it. 
13 If the action fires that cartridge 
14 and successfully ejects that fired cartridge case, 
15 but it fails to properly feed the live cartridge 
16 from the magazine, in other words, it is designed to 
17 come up out of the magazine, go up the feed ramp and 
18 into the chamber, but if it bounces up off of that, 
19 the action can close and trap a live cartridge there 
20 as well. 
21 Now, in either scenario, if you have 
22 something trapped, as I mentioned with 
23 , working the action is all you need to clear that 
24 and assuming you have more ammunition, feed the next 
25 cartridge and then continue to fire, but what you

1 would have left behind on the ground next to you is 
2 different, you would have either the fired cartridge 
3 case that was cleared or the live cartridge that was 
4 cleared. Does that answer your question? 
5 Could you demonstrate how 
6 you clear a round with that particular firearm? 
7 A Okay. If you grip that firearm, it has a 
8 grip and trigger guard, so if your finger is in that 
9 trigger guard, it is held pretty much like this. 
10 Above that, on the back of the gun is 
11 where the hammer would be, okay, visible, external 
12 hammer, all right. So when you pull the trigger, 
13 there is single action and double action, only a 
14 double action trigger pull, it is a long, heavy 
15 trigger pull that also cocks that hammer and then 
16 releases it to strike the firing pin, okay. 
17 If you fire like that, this pistol is 
18 designed for that slide then to come rearward. As 
19 it's coming rearward, the extractor or the hook 
20 pulling it rearward towards the ejector, which then 
21 hits and ejects it out the open ejection port of the 
22 firearm. Whereas that slide comes back, it is 
23 cocking the hammer as well, okay. Because this has 
24 a single action mode as well. 
25 So that hammer will be locked back

1 when that slide feeds the next cartridge and goes 
2 forward. So now you have a loaded cartridge in the 
3 chamber already cocked so your trigger pull is 
4 designed to be much, much less because you don't 
5 have to pull the full weight of it and cock it, you 
6 are only pulling enough to release. Okay. 
7 To answer your question specifically, 
8 if it were jammed, you would simply maintain your 
9 grip on that firearm, most commonly with your other 
10 hand, but if it is incapacitate there are other 
11 means to do it, but grabbing that slide, taking the 
12 pressure off of that jammed live or spent cartridge 
13 case and getting it out of the gun and then letting 
14 it go, it should feed the next cartridge and being 
15 cocked and ready to fire, okay. 
16 Can you 
17 talk about when a spent cartridge is ejected, what 
18 direction does it eject from the gun up, down, side 
19 ways, forward, back, whatever, and then about how 
20 far do you expect it to travel before it hits the 
21 ground? 
22 
23 
A I'm asked that question, I'm sorry. 
Is it pretty consistent 
24 the cartridges hit about the same area? The first 
25 question was direction after the ejection.

1 A I might actually summarize the answer for 
2 the entire question you've asked, because I'm asked 
3 question a lot. It differs for every firearm, but 
4 since we are talking about a particular make and 
5 model here and a specific firearm, I will tell you 
6 that it's unpredictable even within a single firearm 
7 because you have different elements in play. 
8 For example, if the firearm were even 
9 intended to send them in the exact same direction to 
10 the exact same distance every time, a simple turning 
11 of the firearm at any angle is going to change where 
12 those cartridge cases land and how far they go, but 
13 they're not designed to do that. They're really 
14 only designed to clear that weapon. 
15 So sometimes they'll go good 
16 distances, sometimes they'll go short distances, 
17 like they're just dribbling out of the gun, 
18 sometimes they'll fly over the back of your head, 
19 sometimes they'll go to your right, straight up, 
20 forward, and things of that nature. 
21 It is such an unreliable factor for 
22 determining where someone is positioned, for 
23 example, that we don't give any credence to ejection 
24 patterning, if you will. There is just too many 
25 variables that come into play, especially if you

1 start dealing with a scene that intentionally or 
2 even unintentionally has been tampered with is to 
3 strong of term. It could be kicked, it could be 
4 stepped on, it could be carried by a car tire, it 
5 could bounce off of things and so forth. Final 
6 positioning of cartridge cases is something that we 
7 don't even consider. 
8 Cartridge cases 
9 are very light, obviously, they bounce around. When 
10 they're ejected, they don't just roll, they often 
11 come out spinning, flying all of over the place, 
12 correct? 
13 A Absolutely. 
14 On a weapon like that with 
15 a slide that comes back and what I would say is 
16 pretty aggressive if you've ever seen it, it comes 
17 back pretty quick, pretty hard. 
18 A Oh, yeah. 
19 Do you have any guess at 
20 what kind of pressure you apply to a slide like 
21 that, could you hold a slide like that back if 
22 somebody tried to hold the slide, is that possible, 
23 or would you expect a lot of damage to your hands, 
24 the gun? 
25 A Surprisingly, it doesn't take as much as

1 one would think. And the reason I say that is I'm 
2 not going to put my hand in the way. It comes back 
3 with a good deal of force. In fact, there are 
4 officers, you know, when we're issued these guns and 
5 first training on them that if they hold their thumb 
6 in the wrong place, you are going to hurt yourself. 
7 Now that said, I have spoken to 
8 others who have been brave enough, if that's the 
9 right word, to use their thumb to try and hold that 
10 slide in place and they have been successful in 
11 firing that weapon and preventing it from cycling. 
12 So I don't have any idea, I can't 
13 describe what amount of energies and forces it would 
14 take to do that, but I know that it can be done. 
15 And that's a little 
16 surprise because when you see it, it looks like it 
17 comes back with an enormous amount of force. 
18 A Yeah. In fact, what I can tell you is if 
19 I don't have a good way to describe this, but I'd 
20 rather have my thumb on it and against it and trying 
21 to hold it forward then behind it and away from it 
22 and not expecting it because it is going to hurt a 
23 lot more getting hit like that, than it is going to 
24 take to overcome the pressure that it's creating. 
25 I guess even thinking while I'm

1 speaking, the energy that takes that bullet out of 
2 the gun, is also equal but opposite rearward and 
3 that's the recoil. 
4 So if you think about it, if the gun 
5 were to fire without any support from a human being 
6 at all, they would go an equal distance apart, but 
7 we're overcoming that in holding that gun. 
8 So I'm thinking maybe it wouldn't 
9 take so much to prevent that slide from cycling. 
10 Suffice it to say, I know it's possible, I know it 
11 can be done and there is a wide range of ways to do 
12 that. 
13 Do you have any idea what 
14 the opening, once cycle through one series, the 
15 hammer is now cocked, do you have any idea what the 
16 opening is between the back of that slide and the 
17 start of that hammer, is there enough to get a 
18 finger between, a thumb between there? 
19 A Absolutely, it is a visible amount of 
20 distance. In fact, in the training of officers, 
21 when I first started a number of years ago, my first 
22 duty firearm was a revolver and it had an exposed 
23 hammer as well. And part of the training was if we 
24 were faced with a revolver or we're to lose our own 
25 revolver to someone else, was to jam the meat of our

1 hand into that space so then that gun can't be 
2 fired. 
3 So not only are you grabbing the gun, 
4 but you are preventing it from being fired back at 
5 you. So absolutely is there room to obstruct that 
6 whether you intend or not, it could be clothing, it 
7 could be whatever. Is there room? Absolutely. 
8 So 
9 that raised another question. 
10 A Yes. 
11 So in that case, 
12 something were obstructing it other than the 
13 stovepiping, you wouldn't have to do this or do this 
14 with the slide to make it fire again. You would 
15 just have to remove whatever was obstructing that 
16 and then fire that without that added step? 
17 A Correct. If you had the hammer obstructed 
18 and it did not fire, this firearm is designed to 
19 function with another pull of the trigger. 
20 So if that obstruction is removed, it 
21 would have then fired. There are firearms that will 
22 only give you one opportunity, one pull of the 
23 trigger. If it didn't fire, then you have to work 
24 that action. This is not that kind of gun. This is 
25 one that if it doesn't fire once, pull the trigger,

3 Just to be clear. 
4 A Yes. 
5 If it were this type of 
6 situation, you have to do it this way or use your

9 there was something else obstructing it?

MS. WHIRLEY: That stovepiping situation, 
5 would you actually lose the cartridge trying to 
6 clear it so that you could fire again? 
7 A Well, if it is a fired cartridge case that 
8 is obstructing the action, you want to lose it, you 
9 want it out of the firearm, so yes.

11 never fired?

A 
Q 
Right, then you have got a live cartridge. 
You want to clear it because it is in that 
14 standing up position, you would lose that cartridge? 
15 A You would lose a live cartridge because it 
16 would automatically, it needs to load the next live 
17 cartridge. So you want to lose that as well.

19 cartridges other than the one that was in the

14 MS. WHIRLEY: And so in a stovepiping 
15 situation when you lose a live cartridge, to clear 
16 it to get it to fire the next cartridge. 
17 A Not, there is two different scenarios. If 
18 the fired cartridge case failed to eject and got 
19 trapped. The firearm might not necessarily have 
20 grabbed the next live cartridge to feed it. So in 
21 clearing it, you might not lose a live cartridge.

23 it?

1 feed a live cartridge to clear that, you would 
2 definitely lose a live round. Yes. 
3 Does a live 
4 cartridge have the firing pin strike on it so that 
5 it doesn't fire? 
6 A In that scenario it should not 
7 I think not. 
8 A however, bad ammunition would be a 
9 reason a gun might not fire. If it doesn't have a 
10 priming compound or any powder in it because the 
11 manufacturer, you know, the machine skipped that 
12 one, then you very well may have failure to fire. 
13 And it wouldn't be a stovepipe situation, but then 
14 you would still have to work the action to eject 
15 that unfired live cartridge that would have firing 
16 pin impressions, although it is still unfired. 
17 But in a stovepipe situation where a 
18 live cartridge was suspected to have failed to feed 
19 and had to be cleared, I would expect no firing pin 
20 impression. 
21 Obviously, a stovepipe situation with 
22 a fired cartridge case, yes, I would expect a firing 
23 pin impression.
