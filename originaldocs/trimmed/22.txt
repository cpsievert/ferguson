GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. It is 
Page 5 
3 November 11th, Happy Veterans Day everybody, and it 
4 is 8:42 a.m. 
5 So we had originally planned we were going 
6 to go to 2:30 today. As I've mentioned to you in 
7 the past because we are drawing kind of near the 
8 end, it is difficult sometimes for me to get enough 
9 people to fill your day. Today might be one of 
10 those days where we get done early. But originally 
11 I had scheduled an officer to come in at 8:30 this 
12 morning, he was going to talk to you about he 
13 actually measured Darren Wilson's car and so forth 
14 and photographed it. 
15 He called me on the way to work this 
16 morning he said he's a crime scene detective and he 
17 is right now at a crime scene. And so he asked if I 
18 could push his testimony off three or four hours. I 
19 said, well, just text me when you're done and we'll 
20 see where we are. 
21 I have photographs that he took of the 
22 vehicle and then I also have a sheet of paper that 
23 actually was, I think, emailed to me quite some time 
24 ago with the measurements on it that he had taken. 
25 Urn, and so what I would propose to do is 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 that I believe it might be helpful for you to have 
2 those things prior to going down and looking at the 
3 car, just for your own sake. 
4 And so if anybody has an objection to 
5 that, you know, I would like to hear. My thought 
6 was I could give you those photographs and the 
7 measurements and then you all can go look at the 
8 car. And then when you come back, if you have 
9 questions for that officer, you know, we can get him 
10 in later this morning and you can ask questions 
11 about what he did. 
12 You know the only thing he was going to 
13 testify to, yeah, I took these photographs and, 
14 yeah, I took these measurements. So, you know, 
15 unless you had additional questions for him, that's 
16 kind of, you know what I mean, it is not like really 
17 earth shattering. 
18 So that's my proposal that if you are 
19 ready, I will get that stuff for you because I 
20 didn't bring it in here yet to make a copy of 
21 measurements for everybody. 
22 Pass the photographs around so you can 
23 kind of look at them before you go out there and 
24 then you go out and examine the vehicle and you take 
25 the time that you need to do that.

1 Our investigator has made, he has a couple 
2 of steps that he made so he'll give you those for 
3 you to use if you want to do some of your own 
4 investigation. And then at 10:30, I have scheduled 
5 the field training officer for Darren Wilson when he 
6 was an officer at Jennings. You asked about that a 
7 little bit ago, I contacted him, he is coming in at 
8 10:30. 
9 I will probably do a very brief 
10 questioning of him and what his duties and 
11 responsibilities are, and then you can ask him 
12 questions that you think you need to ask. 
13 And then I have, we have the physician's 
14 assistant coming in. She can't be here till 1:00. 
15 Again, we maybe have a gap there and so she will be 
16 here at 1:00 and she will be the last witness of the 
17 day. 
18 Urn, in the meantime, while you're gone 
19 examining the vehicle, Sheila and I talked about it 
20 and we thought we don't have actually the physical 
21 evidence over here at our office yet. That is a 
22 plan before this is all done you are going to be 
23 able to look at things that you want to look at. 
24 There's, we're not going to have discs 
25 brought over, there is no point in looking at a disc

1 because there are lot of discs in evidence. 
2 We do have the clothing of Michael Brown, 
3 which is, as you would imagine is bloody, it is 
4 dried, but it is still bloody. Those are packaged 
5 and in a box. We'll bring that box over for you, 
6 but if you all want to open the box and look at it, 
7 we're going to have to get you gloves and masks and 
8 stuff like that to do that. 
9 But everything else that is in evidence 
10 like the gun, shell casings, the bullets, things 
11 that, you know, the sandals, the bracelets, you 
12 know, things that were seized, we're going to have 
13 those all in a room for you to examine as much as 
14 you want. 
15 And then in the meantime, though, I 
16 thought Sheila and I had said it might be time, that 
17 you could spend working while you are gone examining 
18 the vehicle, I could put out a lot of these 
19 photographs that we've seen over time, crime scene 
20 photographs, and that way, you know, as you are 
21 sitting here, if we're waiting for the next witness, 
22 you all can kind of pass those around and look at 
23 them at your leisure or talk about them just so 
24 you're not sitting here twiddling your thumbs. 
25 And then have you all thought any more,

1 because like I said, we are nearing the end. Are 
2 there any additional witnesses that you think you 
3 need to hear from or would like me to try to get in, 
4 other than as I mentioned, we're still, there is 
5 still about four or five lay people who, you know, 
6 have given some kind of statement in the past about 
7 having seen something, we are trying to get them in. 
8 So we may or may not get all or none of 
9 them in before this is over, but is there anyone 
10 else that y'all would like to hear from or if you 
11 would like to recall a witness, we'll need to know 
12 so I can get that scheduled before, you know, we 
13 conclude everything. 
14 So y'all can talk about that while you are 
15 looking at photographs and stuff too. If there is 
16 any additional people you like or again, if you want 
17 to hear all of the witnesses' testimony is on an 
18 audio disc. We have transcripts of that, so if you 
19 want to review somebody's testimony while you're 
20 here, we can certainly play that for you or just 
21 give you a transcript or whatever you need to review 
22 things, okay. 
23 So with that being said, I guess we'll 
24 take a recess or brief break now while everybody 
25 gets their coats on and I'll get

1 we'll get you over there to look at the vehicle. 
2 And just so you all understand for the 
3 record, this is not Darren Wilson's vehicle, this is 
4 another Tahoe that's the same make, year and model 
5 as Darren Wilson's because the door, as I explained, 
6 is still not on Darren Wilson's vehicle, but the 
7 measurements that I have, actually, don't get your 
8 coats on yet. I told you I was going to get you the 
9 pictures and the measurements. 
10 So we'll take a recess now and I'll go get 
11 those and when you are ready to go over and look at 
12 
13 
the vehicle, we'll get and to take. 
Okay. 
14 (Recess) 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. This is 
16 Kathi Alizadeh, it is November 11th. Sheila Whirley 
17 is here, all 12 grand jurors are here and the court 
18 reporter is taking down what's being said. 
19 So this morning y'all went over, went to 
20 look at the police vehicle. That is the same make, 
21 year and model as Darren Wilson's vehicle or the 
22 vehicle he was driving on August 9th. 
23 You all had plenty of time to do that. Is 
24 there anybody that felt they didn't get to see what 
25 they wanted to see?

1 Also, prior to you all going out there, we 
2 had planned for our witness to testify who actually 
3 photographed and measured, took certain measurements 
4 on Darren Wilson's vehicle. He was going to testify 
5 this morning prior to you seeing that, but the crime 
6 scene detective was actually called to a crime scene 
7 this morning. So it is my understanding that you 
8 don't have any questions for him? So I will let him 
9 know he doesn't need to come in. 
10 Right now we're waiting for our next 
11 witness. So in the meantime I passed out some 
12 photos that have already been, not introduced, but 
13 you all have seen them, but I passed them out so if 
14 you all wanted to look at them again. 
15 I've also given out a another transcript 
16 that contains Darren Wilson's testimony and then 
17 there was also a request to hear again Grand Jury 
18 Exhibit 59, which is a disc that contains a video 
19 audio file that a witness, was 
20 actually talking on Glide, an app that allows you to 
21 talk in realtime. He inadvertently had recorded 
22 
23 
some of the gunshots. If you recall, he said there 
were two shots before he began the recording. So 
24 there was a request to play that again.

1 have other than having graduated from the police 
2 academy in order to be a field training officer? 
3 A There's no legal requirements, most 
4 departments have policies. There is no testing for 
5 it. The academy, the police academy, you go to the 
6 police academy, they have the field training course, 
7 usually a week long.

1 Also policies and procedures of your agency and to 
2 mentor them to become successful police officers. 
3 Q All right. How long did you do that for 
4 the City of Normandy? 
5 A I didn't do it continuously because I went 
6 to different positions for about two years though. 
7 Q And then after leaving Normandy, you went 
8 back to Pine Lawn for about a year. Did you, were 
9 you a field training officer in Pine Lawn? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And then after that, you went to Jennings 
12 and you said you were a field training officer in 
13 Jennings? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And so when a new police officer is 
16 assigned to you, for you to be his FTO, how long is 
17 it that you are training that officer? 
18 A There is different levels of the training. 
19 They are under your direct supervision, ride along 
20 with you, usually for six weeks and then depending 
21 on their performance, you decide whether they are 
22 going to be released to a vehicle on their own, but 
23 you still shadow them. 
24 You are still training the officer, 
25 you are still responsible for them. They're on

1 probation for up to a year. You are basically 
2 responsible for that officer for that whole time. 
3 Q And so typically an officer might ride 
4 along with you for up to in excess of six weeks? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, these officers that are assigned to 
7 you, are they commissioned police officers? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So they've already completed their 
10 training at a police academy, they've already been 
11 hired by the City of Jennings? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
How many officers have you mentored or 
14 been a field training officer for? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I'm guess maybe about ten. 
And during that time, have they all been 
17 brand new police officers fresh out of the police 
18 academy? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
So sometimes are your trainees already 
21 experienced police officers, but they may be new to 
22 your municipality? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And so you said that they would ride along 
25 with you for a minimum of six weeks and then

1 depending on how you felt they were doing, they 
2 might then have their own cars? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And then do you always work the same shift 
5 as your trainee? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q And so if they go on a call, do you go 
8 with them on a call? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
But in a separate car? 
Yes, ma'am. 
So is it your job then to kind of observe, 
13 let them handle the call, but to be there to help 
14 them or observe how they are doing? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And were you the field training officer 
17 for Darren Wilson when he was a Jennings Police 
18 Officer? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And do you remember when he came to

22 academy?

1 Q And so did he ride along with you for at 
2 least six weeks before he then got in a vehicle on 
3 his own? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q Okay. And just in general, how did you 
6 think he did as a trainee during that six weeks? 
7 A He did very well. Out of the officers I 
8 have trained, he was one of those that was probably 
9 a better officer. 
10 Q And then after the six weeks were 
11 completed, did he then begin to ride on his own? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And did you continue to train him or be 
14 his mentor for that first year that he was a police 
15 officer in the City of Jennings? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Q Okay. Now, when a trainee begins to ride 
18 on their own, are they allowed to make their own 
19 arrests? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so they can function in every way as a 
22 police officer in the City of Jennings, except for 
23 the fact that they have somebody that's watching 
24 over them, correct?

3 A No, ma'am, no. 
4 Q Did you ever have any concerns about 
5 Officer Wilson using excessive force during an 
6 arrest? 
7 A No, ma'am. 
8 Q How did you feel he worked with the 
9 community in the City of Jennings? 
10 A Urn, I thought he did very well. One point 
11 that really stands out that I remember distinctly 
12 while he was riding with me in the first six weeks, 
13 we were having a conversation and he brought up the 
14 topic he said, I feel comfortable with the police 
15 work side of it, but I have not had much experience 
16 in the African-American community, such as the one 
17 I'm working in now. I haven't been in that 
18 community. Can you help me with that? 
19 I really thought that that was, 
20 admired him for doing that because it is hard for 
21 somebody to admit that. He took a vested interest 
22 in learning about the community he was working in. 
23 Q So at the time that he was in the City of 
24 Jennings, would you say that the population of 
25 Jennings was, the majority of the population were

1 African-American? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
It is, as it is today I would say. 
Did you ever witness him being what you 
4 consider inappropriate as far as anything that you 
5 thought was racist that he might do or say? 
6 A No, ma'am. 
7 Q Now, I explained to you that there was an 
8 interest of the grand jurors coming in and asking 
9 you some questions, so I'm done asking questions. 
10 Sheila, do you have any questions? 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, I do have just a few. 
12 So tell me how long did you work at 
13 Jennings before you became a field training officer? 
14 A Within my first year they had me start 
15 training at the end of my first year. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Your first year. Did 
17 you have to be on probation for a year. 
18 A I was still on probation when I started 
19 training officers. 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: You were on probation, but 
21 serving as a field training officer? 
22 
23 
A Yes, ma'am.

MS. WHIRLEY: How long did you work at

1 doing well enough to let him be on his own? 
2 A In the City of Jennings as a field 
3 training officer it was computer based program, it 
4 has specific goals, also specific topics that were 
5 covered. You know, like constitutional law, your 
6 state law, your policies, your procedures and also 
7 went over the reports, like fraud report, so you had 
8 all of that. It was already lined out for you. 
9 And there was three things that you 
10 had to do, you had to explain that to the officer 
11 that you were training. 
12 The second one was that they had to 
13 be able to articulate it back to you and then the 
14 third was they I had to actually see them perform 
15 that duty. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: A lot of that is done in the 
17 police academy, is that not correct? You have 
18 constitutional law, criminal law, report writing, 
19 same thing you just mentioned?

1 Q Now, do you write an assessment or some 
2 type of evaluation after the training of the 
3 officer? 
4 A Again, that's all in that computer based 
5 program that the City of Jennings has every day. 
6 You did a daily observation report and you would go 
7 through the list and put the date in what you did 
8 that day. I don't remember weekly or monthly, but 
9 at the end you signed off on that officer. You 
10 signed off after six weeks stating that they are 
11 ready to go on to be shadowed, as we call it. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: You did sign off on Officer 
13 Wilson? 
14 A Yes. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: He met every benchmark that 
16 he was supposed to meet? 
17 A Yes, ma'am.

2 Wilson. 
3 A He started with us in 2009, mid 2009. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And were there ever 
5 any complaints from the residents about him? 
6 A I never had any issues with him or none 
7 were brought to me. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: So it is possible there 
9 were, but you don't know?

A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you already 
12 answered no complaints about excessive use of force, 
13 correct? 
14 A No, ma'am, none. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: What did you teach, is there 
16 anything taught about use of force while you're 
17 training officers? 
18 A Yes, ma'am. Two things that are big 
19 issues with law enforcement. You go over right away 
20 with them pretty much one is use of force. The 
21 second is your emergency vehicle operations, those 
22 are just two things that officers civil liability 
23 affects people's lives. You get your policy out of 
24 your agency at the time, you go over it with them, 
25 make sure they have that. Make sure that they refer

2 Jennings, in our police department, 
3 we have mobile data computer terminals. You can 
4 always look back and look up the policy while you 
5 are on the call or anything of that nature to refer 
6 to. 
7 So you go over that policy and then 
8 for myself, I would go through scenarios like after 
9 we have been on a call. I would play the what if 
10 game and have him articulate to me what he would 
11 have done in this situation. What if this occurred, 
12 how would you handle it and play the what if game. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So there's written 
14 policy and then you kind of do hypotheticals to 
15 verify his knowledge of what he knows what he needs 
16 to do. 
17 What did you or your department do to 
18 assist Officer Wilson with working with the 
19 African-American community? You said that he 
20 actually asked you, told you that he wanted to work 
21 with the community or he didn't know much about 
22 African-Americans and I guess wanted to be a better

7 MS. WHIRLEY: What is important to the

9 A One of the biggest issues I've seen with 
10 young law enforcement they don't take a vested 
11 interest in the community. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear 
13 the last one? 
14 A They don't take a vested interest in the 
15 community they work in. We go to work every day, 
16 the residences are throughout, not usually in the 
17 community you work in. And you come there for 12 
18 hours a day, you go home. 
19 The residents, that's where they 
20 live, that's their home base and it is really 
21 important you take a vested interest in that. When 
22 you do, your job is a lot easier. I think it is 
23 better with the relations with the residents and on 
24 your calls. You understand things.

A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Were there any 
12 African-American field training officers? 
13 A No, ma'am. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So now going back to 
15 the question. What kind of things did you do to 
16 help Officer Wilson understand how to work better 
17 with the African-American community? 
18 A I know you don't want to talk about 
19 Normandy, but I was a school resource officer there. 
20 In Jennings a lot of the residents that I had as a 
21 school resource officer in Normandy were now 
22 residents of Jennings. I would go to those 
23 communities on a call.

25 health issues. And she's fine when she's on her

1 medications, but at times she's not. I would go and 
2 check on her once a week after I had been on a call 
3 there. How you doing. I was able to when she was 
4 not on her medication talk to her and get her back 
5 on medication. That's taking a vested interest in 
6 the community. It is not just going to the call and 
7 answering it and writing the report and leaving. 
8 It is going back on a stolen car, did 
9 you get your car back, you know, did you get it 
10 fixed, things of that nature. That's taking a 
11 vested interest in the community. 
12 
13 A 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
As a school resource officer I was able to 
14 show him that he was always teased, everybody knows 
15 you. When I was a school resource officer, I did 
16 the adopt a student. I would take them to the 
17 basketball games. I took them to those things when 
18 they came up. That's taking a vested interest in 
19 the community.

1 Wilson do some of those things with the 
2 African-American community? 
3 A Yeah, I've seen him buy meals for the 
4 youth, I've seen him follow-up on calls, go and talk 
5 to the residents, you know. He wasn't encompassed 
6 in that police car, he was out and about in the 
7 community. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Questions? 
9 What type of behavioral 
10 screening is there in the academy or maybe you as a 
11 trainer, are there warning signs, certain 
12 personality types that you would fail them from 
13 becoming an officer just because of behavioral 
14 issues, you understand? 
15 A We have, I know for the City of Jennings 
16 you have to go through a psych evaluation before you 
17 can even be hired on the department, and that's 
18 where that is determined. 
19 As far as myself, of course, if you 
20 have anger issues. The person's mental state is not 
21 stable, they can't control their emotions or things 
22 of that nature. That's the concern. That's where 
23 you address those issues. That's in your 
24 evaluations and you try to see what the remedy would 
25 be for that.

14 asked the questions, but what do you look for 
15 personally. Do you look for anything personally on 
16 a personal level with a new officer that you might 
17 feel would be a concern? 
18 A Biggest thing for me I want to see in an 
19 officer the ability to communicate. That's the 
20 biggest part of our job communication. I look for 
21 that. I want to see can they, the problem solving, 
22 how are they, do they look outside the box. Those 
23 are the things I look for in an officer.

9 A Florissant area, in St. Louis County area. 
10 That's it. 
11 You know the reason why 
12 Officer Wilson left Jennings?

14 police services, we were all laid off. 
15 You were all laid off? 
16 A Every officer there was laid off. They 
17 disbanded the police department.

1 on the same shift. 
2 Are you familiar with a term 
3 that was used, use of force triangle, or use of 
4 force continuum? 
5 A Yes, sir. 
6 Can you describe what that 
7 means? 
8 A Basically it is teaching the officers a 
9 suspect can, basically what level of force do you 
10 need to use to control the situation. Not using the 
11 least amount, but to get it done effectively and get 
12 compliance. 
13 To simplify it, you have your just 
14 compliance, officer present, they're compliant. 
15 That was in the triangle, you have that in the 
16 center. And you have threatening resistent, which 
17 will be physically attack. Nonthreatening, which 
18 would be noncompliance. I'm not moving, I'm staying 
19 here. Then you have deadly force, but all goes back 
20 to the center of that triangle to where compliance 
21 is. 
22 You teach the officer, the suspect is 
23 who decides what happens. They're the one who makes 
24 the decision. Everything within the force continuum 
25 is reactive on our part. It is a delicate equation,

1 though, you have to decide what force do I need to 
2 use, but I don't want to use excessive force, but I 
3 don't want to use too little force to where someone 
4 gets hurt also. 
5 Sometimes if you use too less of a 
6 force, then you have to use another avenue, say 
7 mace, you use that. You should have used something 
8 more forceful. You have to go to the time that's 
9 two encounters, two uses of force. Basically where 
10 you used your baton from the beginning that would 
11 have gotten the compliance. 
12 This is something that is 
13 taught to the officers in all of their training, 
14 academy type of training? 
15 A That's taught in the academy, there's also 
16 continued training. Any time that you go to the 
17 academy in the State of Missouri you have to do 48 
18 hours of continuing training every three years. Any 
19 time you have any class using your firearm. Any 
20 defensive tactics or anything, that's brought back

2 very tight compressed time situation that that was 
3 something that an officer would instinctively fall 
4 back onto? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
Thank you. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question for you. 
8 In either the police academy training or in what you 
9 might train as being a field training officer, if an 
10 officer is faced, finds himself in a situation and 
11 he makes a decision to use deadly force to react to 
12 something that he sees is a threat to himself or the 
13 community, is there any training in the police 
14 academy or in field training where you, the officer, 
15 is taught or instructed to, for example, if you are 
16 going to use your firearm to like shoot at their 
17 legs or shoot at an area of their body that might 
18 not be a fatal shot? 
19 In other words 
20 A All training you are taught to in your 
21 firearms training to aim towards center mass to stop 
22 the threat. Your goal, again, is compliance, stop 
23 the threat. It is not to aim for the leg in high 
24 stress situation, you're not able to do that 
25 physically.

1 Also, in trying to stop the threat, 
2 the only way that the end of use firearm that you 
3 would stop the threat immediately without their 
4 willingness to comply would be something that 
5 strikes the central nervous system. A shot in the 
6 leg and they are still able to attack you and do 
7 harm to you. You can take a shot to the heart and 
8 still basically fight for up to 30 seconds easily, a 
9 minute. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So it is a part of 
11 training if you are reacting to a threat that you 
12 deem you need to use a firearm to meet that threat, 
13 you aim for the center mass? 
14 A Correct. When I say center mass, whatever 
15 is exposed, whatever you have. It is not always 
16 going to be just the chest, it is going to be 
17 whatever is exposed that you are aiming at. 
18 We heard about two 
19 African-American police officers out of 40

1 the academy, what was the dynamics? 
2 A We had no African-American officers in my 
3 academy class. 
4 You said that you were 
5 trained to hit at center mass, okay. And I've heard 
6 a lot of people in the media talk about why didn't 
7 the police officer just let him run away and put an 
8 all points bulletin on him. Can you tell me about 
9 your training as far as not just your safety, but as 
10 far as the community, would that be against what you 
11 would be taught in the academy, just let a suspect 
12 go and get him later? 
13 A No, ma'am. That's our job as a police 
14 officer to apprehend suspects. Whenever somebody 
15 has a crime committed or anything, they call us, we 
16 are the ones that have to respond while everybody 
17 else is trying to get away from the area. It is our 
18 duty to protect the community. That's what we swear 
19 to when we we're hired. And in doing so, you have 
20 to prevent a suspect from fleeing, then they can do 
21 further harm to the community. 
22 No, you're not taught to shy away 
23 from that. We always respond, that's our job and we

1 protocol, kind of step by step protocol of making an 
2 arrest? 
3 A From what part? 
4 I guess the point at which 
5 an officer determines there is a cause for arrest 
6 and then what kind of protocol is going forth? 
7 A Each agency has their own policy. I can 
8 give you a general rundown. As an officer you 
9 observe or probable cause to believe that a crime 
10 has been committed. And in doing so for speeding, 
11 you write them a ticket. Some agencies have 
12 policies that you have to arrest people for certain 
13 offenses, which even could be something to write a 
14 ticket for driving while suspended. If you observe 
15 the crime, you take your enforcement action. You 
16 write your report to articulate everything about 
17 that incident, the elements of the crime. 
18 So as far as the arrest part, that's 
19 where that comes in when you apprehend the suspect. 
20 From there most agencies you go to 
21 the station, complete the booking process. Usually 
22 in the municipalities the judges have a bond 
23 schedule, who has to post bond. Some are released 
24 on a summons after they are processed and you see if 
25 they have warrants, if they have to go to another

1 agency or anything of that nature. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Officer , let me 
3 ask you a question. When an officer in your 
4 training, an officer, once the officer makes a 
5 determination that he is going to place the suspect 
6 under arrest, is he taught to use whatever means is 
7 necessary to affect that arrest given whatever 
8 circumstances he may be presented with. 
A Yes, ma'am. 9 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So, for example, if you 
11 have a fleeing suspect. 
A Yes, ma'am. 12 
13 Q Is there any training based on either 
14 police academy training or training under a field 
15 officer, field training officer where you would give 
16 that suspect commands to stop and desist, get down, 
17 freeze, you know, phrases like that. And then if 
18 the suspect does not, would that, do you have any 
19 training on do you then pursue that suspect or do 
20 you just let them run away? 
21 A You have to look at the totality of the 
22 circumstances of that particular incident. 
23 You have to weigh the safety of the 
24 community, the safety of the officer. For example, 
25 in a vehicle, if their crime doesn't outweigh them

1 running and taking off in the vehicle and us 
2 pursuing them and we hit an innocent victim and 
3 they're killed, does their crime outweigh that? No, 
4 we don't. If the danger that they could cause the 
5 community is greater, then yes, you will pursue. 
6 Q So someone who is speeding and won't pull 
7 over, you're not going to engage them in a high 
8 speed pursuit? 
A No, ma'am. 9 
10 Q But the suspect that you are attempting to 
11 pull over, if he has a warrant for murder in the 
12 first degree, a violent offense such as an assault 
13 or a sexual crime, you might under the circumstances 
14 make a determination to pursue that suspect? 
A Yes, ma'am. 15 
16 Q So it is all dependent upon the 
17 circumstances, correct? 
A Correct. 18 
19 Q And officers are trained and taught that 
20 they have to very quickly assess the circumstances 
21 and use their best discretion and their decision 
22 making on whether you pursue that suspect, allow 
23 that suspect to get away. And what means you need 
24 to take in order to affect an arrest if you 
25 determine to pursue the suspect?

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Did you ever have any question about 
3 Officer Wilson's ability to quickly assess a 
Page 42 
4 situation, like was he overly, you know, some people 
5 are over thinkers, they want to really sit back and 
6 decide, to have time to examine all possibilities 
7 and some people react too quickly without really 
8 giving thought to what they're doing. Were you ever 
9 concerned that Darren Wilson was either over 
10 thinking and might not react appropriately in time 
11 or that he was too quick to react without thinking 
12 things through? 
13 A I thought his judgment, he always made 
14 sound judgments on his decisions. Of course, we 
15 always go back and look how could we have done it 
16 better the next time. At the time when he is 
17 handling things, he always had good judgment.

1 say you may have like, I guess, someone speeding 
2 away from you, you may say, hey, it is not worth it. 
3 Let's give an example, let's say you were 
4 in a residential area and there's cars going in both 
5 directions, people taking their garbage out, be 
6 people walking their dogs and the suspect is running 
7 away. How would that kind of situation be handled

9 people could get hurt?

In a vehicle, the suspect is in a vehicle? 
No, the suspect is walking? 
What am I stopping them for? 
Jaywalking. 
MS. ALIZADEH: For jaywalking, is that 
15 what you said? 
16 Yeah. 
17 A And they take off on foot? 
Yes. 18 
19 A I would pursue them, if I'm taking 
20 enforcement action and take off on foot, yeah, I 
21 would. It also depends. I've been in foot pursuits 
22 where someone has jumped off a high concrete wall on 
23 the entrance ramp to a highway, I'm not going to put 
24 myself in danger to do that for a jaywalking. 
25 At some point you'll say

1 well, I mean, I see people here, people on their 
2 balcony, people here, maybe I shouldn't shoot in 
3 this situation? 
4 A I don't know where we got to the shooting 
5 part on this. You said simply jaywalking. You said 
6 fled on foot. 
7 Fled on foot. 
8 A What actions? 
9 You had a confrontation and 
10 he runs away on foot? 
11 A I can't play the what if thing game, it 
12 has to be the totality of the circumstances. 
13 I'm getting to the part 
14 where you have the suspect and you notice that their 
15 are traffic, cars, you know this is residential area 
16 and there is people on balconies, people could be 
17 walking their dog, and people taking their trash 
18 out. And this person is unarmed, would you decide 
19 maybe this is not the best way to pull my gun out or 
20 somebody else could get hurt? 
21 Does he know the person is 
22 unarmed?

24 you're saying.

1 little bit. Did you ever teach officer Darren 
2 Wilson when to or when not to open fire in a 
3 residential, to have a different response? 
4 A When you decide to use deadly force, it is 
5 the threat that you perceive at the time. If it is 
6 in a residential area, at times you will have to 
7 fire in a residential area. 
8 Okay. 
9 A Again, these are vague, you are asking 
10 vague when you have a situation. You are asking me 
11 to make a determination on something that you can't 
12 do, you have the totality of the circumstances. 
13 Okay. 
14 A Just for jaywalking, would I pull a gun? 
15 No. If I stop somebody for jaywalking and it turns 
16 into a physical altercation, it is not a jaywalking 
17 any more. We've gotten beyond that. 
18 The thing also you have to look at 
19 is, what I perceive that I stop somebody for may not 
20 be what that suspect perceives. 
21 I know when an officer stopped 
22 somebody for a simple speeding, little did he know 
23 that guy had just committed an armed robbery at a 
24 7-Eleven. So the officer think's he's just going to 
25 a speeding enforcement, but the suspect in his mind

1 thought he was being stopped for the robbery. So 
2 that decides the suspects, but for a simple 
3 jaywalking, no, you don't pull your weapon. But 
4 when the assault occurred, we are not talking about 
5 jaywalking, jaywalking is irrelevant at that point. 
6 And we both, two people have 
7 used that speeding example. So if you try to pull 
8 somebody over who is speeding and they refuse to 
9 stop, would you take, what would happen, would you 
10 just let them go or would you try another means to 
11 have them pull over? Not necessarily going on a 
12 high speed chase, but would you like try to get in 
13 front of them or call somebody else to try to help 
14 you or would you just let them go? 
15 A You use your radio, you put radio traffic 
16 out there. You never would put your vehicle in 
17 front of another vehicle for speeding. 
18 Okay. 
19 A Your decision to pursue that person for 
20 speeding, a lot of times to continue to drive in 
21 traffic, you back off, get a license plate or 
22 something to go and follow-up on. But you use your 
23 other agencies, if you have a helicopter above, 
24 things of that nature.

1 whether or not you want to go on a high speed chase, 
2 that doesn't mean you are going to let that person 
3 get away with it? 
4 A I will not go on a high speed chase just 
5 for speeding, I will tell you that. 
6 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) I have a question, 
7 Officer We know a little bit about your 
8 walkie-talkie and the mobile radios in cars, and 
9 does your walkie-talkie have an alert button? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ours do with our agency, yes. 
And did your walkie-talkie have an alert 
12 button when you were training Officer Wilson? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And is there any instruction or what do 
15 you train your officers to do as far as when it is 
16 appropriate to use that alert button or not 
17 appropriate, or is it just the officer's discretion 
18 or what? 
A The alert tone on your radio is used for 19 
20 when you need assistance. If you feel that you need 
21 officers to respond, you need aid, that is when you 
22 use your alert tone. 
23 Q If, for example, you have already used 
24 your radio to call for assistance, you already 
25 verbally said I need an assist car, can you send

Page 48 
1 somebody right to my location or whatever, so let me 
2 ask you. Would you say that the alert tone is more 
3 for something that's a lot more serious than, hey, 
4 send another car to assist me on a stop? 
5 A Alert tone is I need help, get here as 
6 fast as you can. That's when you would use the 
7 alert. 
8 Q 
9 situation? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Maybe life or death or very serious 
I'm under attack. 
And maybe the officer can't get to his 
12 radio to call out on his mike? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A With our radios, they don't get out 
16 everywhere, even the alert tone doesn't get out. 
17 The radio gives confirmation that it did get 
18 received actually, but it doesn't get out. There's 
19 some buildings that I was involved in a situation 
20 where I was being assaulted and my radio I couldn't 
21 get out and transmit and my alert tone would not get 
22 out of the building. 
23 Q You head the alert button and dispatch 
24 does not get that alert tone? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. You know, if the radio frequency

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Grand Jury Volume XXII November 11, 2014 
Page 49 
1 that's what it is transmitted on as well. 
2 For a scenario, just a 
3 scenario, if you had already called something in on 
4 your radio, and something escalates, you wouldn't 
5 necessarily, or you would maybe necessarily use your 
6 alert button because you already know, either you 
7 knew or that's a backup way to get here more 
8 quickly. 
9 A You asked me to assist, things are under 
10 control. It gets to where it is volatile, I can't 
11 concentrate on transmitting on my radio, I can hit 
12 my button. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: But you have to have a free 
14 hand to hit the button? 
15 A Correct. 
16 You know what Officer 
17 Wilson's range for proficiency was? 
18 
19 
A No, sir. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Officers that are 
20 commissioned police officer have to qualify on a 
21 regular basis. In other words, they have to show 
22 that they're proficient in firearms? 
23 A 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

Page 50 
1 MS. ALIZADEH: How often do you have to 
2 qualify? 
3 A We do it there every six months. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So that means going to a 
5 range, you have to hit the target in a certain area 
6 a certain number of times in order to be able to 
7 continue to be an armed officer? 
8 A Correct. It is pass or fail. 
9 When you say feel, that you 
10 have to hit your alert button and you say you feel 
11 that you are under attack, what's your under attack, 
12 what's your definition of it? 
13 A At the time I've used my alert I'm 
14 physically involved in an altercation with a suspect 
15 or if I'm having several approach me, anywhere where 
16 I feel a threat is, it is imminent for somebody to 
17 get there to help me. 
18 Suspect is running way from 
19 you, and then right in front of you would you still

It happened a month after this whole

9 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, wait a minute. If 
10 this is still under investigation, I'd rather you 
11 not. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: I would agree, it is 
13 something still pending; is that right? 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Let's not talk about it. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: I would agree with that. I 
16 was thinking something earlier. 
17 
18 
19 
A No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
If a suspect is fleeing from 
20 you, what the other juror said, and you didn't 
21 really feel under attack, that would not keep you 
22 from trying to get him still? 
23 A Oh, not at all. I would still go after 
24 him. 
25 You are still going to

1 pursue him? 
2 A Correct. 
3 And that can be in second's 
4 notice? 
5 A It depends on the attack on myself. 
6 That's where you weigh the circumstances. The 
7 attack on myself is him getting away a danger to the 
8 community 
9 When he's running away you 
10 wouldn't necessarily feel like you're under attack, 
11 so the need for an alert button wouldn't be there at 
12 that time, maybe not? 
13 A I won't say that, no, I'm not saying that. 
14 You wouldn't feel under 
15 attack, running away? 
16 A No. 
17 So I can understand it, when 
18 a suspect after they've had an altercation with you, 
19 okay, for example, and they're running away, you 
20 would still consider them to be a threat possibly to 
21 the community because, or yourself, and I'm just 
22 thinking is it because maybe they could get a weapon 
23 somewhere, maybe they could take someone hostage, 
24 you don't know if they're armed or not or whatever, 
25 is that the mindset to this where you would still

1 pursue them, decide it being your job to pursue and 
2 capture a suspect that's done something, you know, 
3 broken the law or whatever? 
4 A If somebody has assaulted me personally as 
5 a police officer, they can assault anyone out there. 
6 I mean, someone who assaults a police officer or 
7 someone in authority, what would prevent them from 
8 assaulting anyone else. 
9 Suspects know we are trained, know we 
10 have weapons of that nature, you know. If they are 
11 willing to attack us knowing that we have that, what 
12 would prevent them from attacking a citizen who 
13 doesn't have that, those tools. 
14 How have you been taught to 
15 utilize your vehicle's lights and siren 
16 appropriately? I guess, what would cause you to use 
17 those? 
18 A In the State of Missouri state law, if 
19 you're going to violate any traffic laws or anything 
20 be consider an emergency room vehicle, your use of 
21 lights and audible signal, doesn't specify siren, 
22 audible signal must be used. In the State of 
23 Missouri at least one flashing red signal. You use 
24 those when you are responding to calls and on the

1 something of that nature and if you want to stop a 
2 traffic violater then you use it, things of that 
3 nature. 
4 You wouldn't use it, for 
5 instance, like you were stopping someone on foot? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Like a pedestrian check. 
8 A You might use it if, you know, you are 
9 stopping somebody on the side of the highway, 
10 walking on the side of the highway, I'm going to 
11 turn my warning lights for warning purposes, but no, 
12 it is not required to stop that person. 
13 Thank you. 
14 If you were blocking traffic 
15 kind of, you would turn just your lights on, but not 
16 the sirens to signify that this is a police matter 
17 or something? 
18 A It depends on the roadway. I've pulled 
19 over onto the shoulder many times without turning 
20 any of my emergency equipment on. In residential 
21 areas, you park on the side of street just like cars 
22 do.

14 someone's course of walk or the direction they are 
15 headed, would you take your vehicle and block it in 
16 their path to address that? 
17 A At certain times you would. 
18 Do you think that could be 
19 seen as aggressive? 
A By the suspect? 
Yes. 
20 
21

18 different from maybe a nurse or a physician? 
19 A So we are considered midlevel providers. 
20 So we have master's level degree training. We 
21 practice medicine under the supervision of a 
22 physician. So in our particular practice we would 
23 practice in the same manner that a physician would. 
24 Our charts are reviewed at the end of the day by the 
25 physician.

Would there be times when you might

16 call in a physician to assess a patient? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Okay. And so, for example, minor injuries 
19 or things that don't appear to be emergent in

1 A No. In the State of Missouri midlevels do 
2 the have the option to obtain a controlled substance 
3 license as well as DEA number. Most of the 
4 midlevels in our facility do not because it is 
5 unnecessary. We don't prescribe a lot of narcotics 
6 and the little times we do, a physician is always 
7 on-site to cosign our prescription.

Q 
Yes. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) If you were to 
17 prescribe, for example, a nonnarcotic medication or 
18 something that's not a controlled substance like 
19 Naprosyn, is it Naprosyn or Naproxen? 
20 A Naprosyn is a brand name and Naproxen is 
21 the generic.

23 a control; is that correct?

So if I get that, it has to be prescribed? 
Correct. 
But being nonnarcotic, you can write the 
12 prescription for me? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And then if you were to have a DEA number 
15 and have obtained the ability to prescribe 
16 controlled substances, and that's an option for a 
17 midlevel care physician's assistant, correct?

1 ask you this then. Can you describe for the grand 
2 jurors what your training and background is in order 
3 to be a physician's assistant? 
4 A So I have my undergraduate degree, my 
5 bachelor of science in athletic training. And then 
6 I went on to graduate school where I got my master's 
7 of science in physician assistant studies. So in 
8 total with the 2 degrees it was about seven years of 
9 training. 
10 Q And then when you, do you have to pass any 
11 board examinations in order to be a physician 
12 assistant? 
13 A Yes. We have a national certified board 
14 that we have to certify initially and then every six 
15 years after that. 
16 Q And so a physician's assistant would not 
17 be considered, obviously, you are not a medical 
18 doctor, correct? 
19 A Correct. 
20 Q But a physician's assistant has more 
21 education and training than, for example, a 
22 registered nurse or a practical nurse? 
23 A Correct. 
24 Q Okay. And so when you are working, and

Christian Northeast. 
Is it a part of Christian Northeast? 
Yes. 
So if somebody has an emergent situation, 
8 they are going to go to Christian Northeast, would 
9 they come into your department? 
10 A They may. It just depends on their 
11 location. The two emergency rooms are about 7 miles 
12 apart. It depends on where they're located. 
13 Q On August 9th, where was your department

8 Darren Wilson on August 9th?

1 four hours like everybody has to before a doctor can 
2 see you? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q Sorry, I couldn't resist that jab. We've 
5 all been there. So a nurse will do an initial 
6 assessment to do how quickly this patient needs to 
7 be seen? 
8

A 
Q 
Right. 
Does that nurse take some basic 
10 information from the patient?

12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after that nurse, for example, if 
13 that nurse determines that this is not a patient 
14 that needs to be seen like, you know, ASAP or stat, 
15 or whatever your language is, then who would the 
16 next person be that that patient will see? 
17 A The patient would then likely see one of 
18 our techs who would bring the patient back to a room 
19 whenever it became available. 
20 They would take vital signs for the 
21 patient and then the person after that would 
22 actually be the nurse that would be caring for the 
23 patient while they were in the exam room.

1 looking at this, this is an admission form? 
2 A Correct, this is something that 
3 registration would fill out. 
4 Q So this has to do with insurance and just 
5 basic pedigree information, address and so forth? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q So then the next page is an abstract 
8 summary. Now you and I talked about this and what 
9 is, what we call coders. There are people in the 
10 hospital that have to at some point put codes into 
11 these records so that the insurance gets billed for 
12 the right procedure for what was done, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q So these codes on here for the diagnosis, 
15 reason for and then there's primary diagnosis and 
16 then secondary diagnosis, it is difficult to see 
17 because they are in those black bars. Those are all 
18 things that a coder selects based upon what they 
19 read in the records was the diagnosis, correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And they have to select from a finite 
22 number of options to put a code in, correct? 
23 A Yes.

25 insurance reasons?

8 nurse would have taken or the triage person as you 
9 said? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q Okay. And so down in the paragraph it 
12 says triage, it says chief complaint quote, and then 
13 in quotes it says, he needs x-rays he was hit in the 
14 face a couple of times. 
15 You're not the person who entered 
16 that into that paragraph, correct? 
17 A No, that was our triage nurse who sits out 
18 front in our waiting room. 
19 Q Do you know if the triage nurse got that 
20 information from the patient or could it have been 
21 from somebody with the patient? 
22 A I believe it was somebody with the 
23 patient, specifically his supervisor.

25 police officer's supervisor?

2 Q And then also down it says here that on 
3 the next line, the patient presented with St. Louis 
4 County Police to the emergency room for evaluation. 
5 So that means he was with police 
6 officers, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And then it says from home? 
9 A Right. So, yeah, usually the nurse, the 
10 triage nurse will ask, you know, did they come from, 
11 say if they were in a car accident, did they come 
12 straight from the car accident or did they go home 
13 first and then come from home. 
14 At some point he must have said that 
15 he came from home. Now whether or not he did or 
16 not, that's not something I discussed with him. 
17 Q Okay. So that's a note that's put in by 
18 the triage nurse? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And whether or not Darren Wilson said that 
21 or one of the people with him told her that, or 
22 whether or not that's even accurate, we don't know? 
23 A Correct.

1 warm and dry. 
2 So what is the triage nurse assessing 
3 when she's looking at someone's skin? 
4 A Just that he's not, that he's not pale or 
5 sweating excessively or blue or red or having any 
6 obvious issues with circulation or difficulty 
7 breathing, which may change their skin color. 
8 Q This is part of a neurologic examine. Not 
9 like you are noticing that he has redness to his 
10 forehead? 
11 A Correct. Just very initial exam. Is the 
12 patient upright, is he aware what's going on, is he 
13 able to speak. 
14 Q And, again, downward in the medical 
15 screening continued, the note is that the skin is 
16 pink, warm and dry. Is that just in general the 
17 skin on his body appears to be normal? 
A Just in general, yes. 
Q And then patient denies physical or 
18 
19 
20 emotional abuse. Is the patient asked if he was 
21 abused? 
22 A This is a question that every patient gets 
23 asked when they come into our department and it is 
24 referring to domestic abuse at home.

1 involving this patient? 
A No. 2 
3 Q So every patient, and I think you said 
4 even if they came in for a sore throat or cold is 
5 asked that question? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And then on the next page, also down where 
8 it says abuse screening, it says patient states that 
9 he or she is not a victim of violence. Is that 
10 domestic violence specifically? 
A Yes, domestic. 11 
12 Q He's not asked if somebody hurt you, he's 
13 asked if anybody had any domestic assault or

2 Q And so the patient on those particular 
3 times graded his pain consistently on those four 
4 occasions a six out of ten? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q And then where it says description, it 
7 says aching. Is that something the patient provided 
8 or would the nurse put that in there? 
9 A The nurse would have given him some 
10 options for description, such as sharp, or stabbing 
11 or aching or throbbing. And then the patient would 
12 pick the one that most fits it. 
13 Q So Darren Wilson on that day said my pain 
14 is aching and it is six out of ten? 
A Correct. 15

Q 
Yes. 
And that's what goes in there then?

23 someone trip you or push you down the stairs, or 
24 were you drinking alcohol that caused you to fall 
25 down the stairs or you just trying to find out how

1 the incident occurred? 
2 A We might ask what, you know, as far as 
3 falling down the stairs, what made them fall and 
4 they can say oh, I tripped, I slipped, I passed out 
5 and then I fell down the stairs. 
6 Q Okay. And in this case, someone who says 
7 I have bilateral joint pain after being punched in 
8 the face while attempting to detain a suspect, he 
9 was also scratched in the neck. Again, that's stuff 
10 that Darren Wilson told you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Did you then inquire about what were you 
13 going to try to arrest the suspect for, what 
14 happened immediately prior to being punched in the 
15 face? 
16 A No, no, that's not stuff we would go into. 
17 Q Okay. And let me ask you to clarify. You 
18 know that this examine you did was in relation to 
19 Officer Wilson and his involvement that culminated 
20 in the shooting of Mike Brown, right? 
21 A I do now, we were unaware of the event at 
22 the time. 
23 Q Okay. So when you were treating Darren 
24 Wilson, you didn't know anything about Mike Brown 
25 having been shot?

A Correct. 1 
2 Q Would you have treated him any differently 
3 or is there something that now you look back I wish 
4 I would have done had I known? 
5 A No, basically because his complaint was 
6 jaw pain, our focus is, you know, how did the jaw 
7 pain occur. He got punched. What, who punched him, 
8 you know, and then what his complaint is as far as 
9 pain or any complications from that. 
10 But from a medical standpoint it is 
11 not going to change how we treat him or what we do 
12 based on what led up to that event. 
13 Q Okay. And ultimately, you know, after you 
14 having reviewed this record, you diagnosed him with 
15 contusion of the mandibular joint area? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
And so your mandible is your jaw, correct? 
Correct. 
So what is a contusion? 
Contusion is basically a bruise, 
21 inflammation, irritation to the soft tissue. 
22 Q And we talked about that a little bit ago 
23 about bruising and we all have had bruises, we've 
24 had kids that had bruises, do people bruise 
25 differently?

A 
Q 
Page 78 
Yes. 
And do different areas of the body bruise 
3 differently? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q We've also talked about that bruises can 
6 go through like a continuum, almost like a color 
7 spectrum from deep purposely to blue to greenish 
8 color to a yellow issue color, correct? 
A Yes. 9 
10 
11 
Q Do all bruises go through that continuum? 
A No, it really depends on the area. It 
12 also depends on the severity of the initial injury. 
13 So sometimes it can start as just a mild redness and 
14 then it resolves or it can go through the color 
15 stages of red to purple, blue and then fading to 
16 green and yellow. 
17 Q Did you notice any swelling to Darren 
18 Wilson face? 
A Nothing significant, no. 19 
20 Q Okay. And, obviously, probably we've all 
21 seen pictures and you've probably seen in real life 
22 when someone, like the entire side of their face is 
23 swollen, that would be something very evident and 
24 apparent, correct? 
25 A Correct.

1 Q Are there times when people may have some 
2 slight swelling, but you can't tell if that might, 
3 they have a chubby face or that's just the way their 
4 face looks normally, for example? 
5 A Correct. Several times patients will come 
6 in complaining of swelling and it is just not 
7 evident to us because we don't see what their normal 
8 tissue looks like on a normal day. So if he 
9 complained of any swelling, it wasn't noticeable

16 cause a contusion?

does that look like the patient you 
that day? 
Yes. 
Is that how he appeared when you saw him? 
Yes. 
Did you seize any specimens from him by 
12 any chance or take anything from him? 
13 A He submitted a urine drug screen, not to 
14 us, but to an outside company called Guardian that 
15 we contact for work related injuries. 
16 Q And you learned that this happened while 
17 he was on duty, correct?

20 injury?

And so that's considered a work related

1 Q Okay. And so did you or another nurse 
2 take his urine sample when he was there? 
3 A No. A representative from the company 
4 Guardian comes into the department and handles that 
5 full aspect of it. 
6 Q And the testing of the urine sample is 
7 done by that company? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then I'm just going to show you some 
10 pictures that have been taken while he was at the 
11 hospital, do you note any of the redness in any of 
12 these pictures in particular that help to 
13 demonstrate what you saw that day? 
14 A Yeah, his primary complaint was to the 
15 right side of the jaw, and so you can see a little 
16 bit of redness there and a little bit of redness 
17 there. We didn't notice any issues to the left side 
18 of the jaw. 
19 Q Did he complain of pain to the left side 
20 of the jaw? 
21 A Very, very mild pain to the left side of 
22 the jaw.

A 
Q 
Correct. 
Are there any of these images where they 
7 depict the injuries that you describe or that are 
8 shown that we might use? 
9 A A little bit of redness here at the 
10 hairline. It is a little difficult to see in the 
11 photograph the actual kind of linear marks that I 
12 saw during the examine, but you can kind of see some 
13 lines developing with the redness. 
14 Q Okay. And so you were pointing out Image 
15 Number 12 as showing the redness of the hairline? 
16 A Correct.

18 linear marks?

5 the hairline, right?

A No. 
Q Did he talk about any pain in that area? 
A Nothing of significance, no.

9 
10 
11 Q Now, and I talked to you just briefly 
12 before this and I told you that Officer Wilson was 
13 photographed, similar photographs were taken of him, 
14 I believe, on the 13th, which would have been 
15 actually on the 12th. And I asked you, we talked 
16 about bruising and how bruises appear and how long 
17 it takes bruises to appear. 
18 In these photographs do you see any 
19 apparent bruising that might demonstrate that is 
20 consistent with your diagnosis of a contusion? 
21 A It appears the redness that he had 
22 initially has resolved. I don't see any of the 
23 purple discoloration that sometimes follows 
24 contusions.

1 redness three days, I'm not sure what time those 
2 pictures were taken, but let's just say roughly 
3 three days after the injury resulted or occurred, 
4 does that change your opinion as to the diagnosis? 
5 A No, because it will not always progress to 
6 that point that it turns into that distinctive 
7 purple bruising that we are used to seeing. 
8 Q You still, in your opinion, is the same 
9 that you've diagnosed Darren Wilson with a contusion 
10 of his mandible? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And he was x-rayed and there is no 
13 fracture or any other injuries to his jaw or face;

Right, yes.

MS. WHIRLEY: Urn, yes. Progressing from 
19 redness to the face to bruising, which you looked at 
20 the photos of him a couple of days later and there 
21 was no bruising according to the photos, and you 
22 only saw redness on the face, correct, no bruising? 
23 A Correct.

25 of the face to a bruise, would that depend on the

Page 86 
1 impact, how hard a person is struck? 
2 A Yes. You know, generally the harder the 
3 impact, the more blood vessel involvement. So a 
4 bruise is caused by broken blood vessel. So the 
5 harder the punch, the harder the impact, the more 
6 likely you are to have more blood vessels being 
7 broken. And that's when those blood vessels start 
8 to bleed, that's what creates that purple 
9 discoloration as that blood kind of seeps out 
10 underneath the layer. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: If the face is red, but 
12 never turns purple, does that mean that the impact 
13 was not hard enough to break any blood vessels? 
14 A It was likely that the impact just 
15 involved the very superficial capillary layers, as 
16 opposed to deeper tissue which would result in the 
17 deeper purple bruising. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I don't think I heard

1 his eyes at all? 
2 A No, he did not complain of any eye pain or 
3 nose pain or tooth pain or any head pain. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Head pain you said. 
5 A No head pain. There was no evidence of 
6 any injury to these areas. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: So in your opinion there are 
8 no permanent injuries? 
9 
10 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And you said there were no 
11 fractures. Would he have needed to take time off 
12 because of the injury that he was treated for? 
13 A No. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: No. And as far as the 
15 document saying that he was injured by being 
16 stricken or however it is phrased, that is his 
17 self-reporting, correct?

Could you see redness of the face?

3 self-reporting? 
4 A Yes. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: I could get redness to the 
6 face from several different ways or mechanism?

3 A On Graham Road, yes. 
4 So you are right across the 
5 street from the physician building? 
6 A Yes, yeah. 
7 You said the area and the 
8 severity of the injury can be affected by how the 
9 bruise continues to manifest itself, correct? 
10 A Yes, a worsening, a deeper bruise 
11 typically indicates a more severe injury. 
12 And Naprosyn is an 
13 anti-inflammatory drug. 
14 A Yes. 
15 So with the application of 
16 ice, what you told him to do, apply ice. 
17 A Yes. 
18 And consumption of an 
19 anti-inflammatory also have an affect on how the 
20 bruising would manifest itself? 
21 A Yes. So the sooner ice is applied, the 
22 sooner anti-inflammatory medicines are taken, the 
23 more likely that a bruise or injury would resolve 
24 sooner than if no treatment were taken.

1 anti-inflammatory drug while he was there? 
2 A Yes, he was given a single dose of 
3 Naprosyn. 
4 And a single dose is 500

23 something similar.

1 you ask a patient for pain, kind of how that relates 
2 to what they feel versus what you as a professional 
3 can evaluate? 
4 A The pain scale, is that what you mean? 
5 
6 A 
Yes. 
That is very subjective. So that the way 
7 that it is worded generally is, rate your pain on a 
8 scale of one to ten, ten being the worse pain that 
9 you've ever experienced or could ever imagine 
10 experiencing. So for someone who has never 
11 experienced much pain in their life may have what 
12 others would call relatively mild pain, but still 
13 may be the worst pain that they personally ever 
14 experienced. They may rate it on a higher scale. 
15 So it very much differs from 
16 person to person. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Nothing that a doctor or 
19 nurse no matter their education or training could 
20 disagree with or agree with?

20 swelling, how long does it take someone to swell? 
21 A Really varies from person to person. It 
22 really depends on the injury and location of the 
23 injury. Someone may develop swelling within 
24 minutes, some may develop swelling within 24 hours. 
25 It really depends on each person and the location.

1 When you were talking with 
2 Darren Wilson, getting assessment from him, was he 
3 100 percent himself or was he relying on the 
4 supervisor or others around to assist with his 
5 responses? 
6 A The detectives that were present with him 
7 in the room did not speak the entire time that I was 
8 in there. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: So you have an independent 
10 recollection of your interaction with this officer; 
11 is that correct? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
A 
Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: What was his demeanor? 
Urn, calm, cooperative, nothing seemed out 
15 of the ordinary to me. Possibly at most slightly 
16 apprehensive initially. I feel that when I walked 
17 into the room I was probably interrupting a 
18 discussion between him and the detectives. Once I 
19 started my exam, he was calm and didn't appear 
20 overly anxious or anything. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: He didn't say anything to 
22 you what happened other than he was struck in the 
23 face? 
24 A His words were he was punched in the face 
25 by a suspect while attempting to detain the suspect.

MS. WHIRLEY: Did he tell you anything 
No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
Could an arm keep rubbing on 
6 a face, could that have made the face red? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Injuries like this, is that 
9 something typically you would see on a day-to-day 
10 just because the incident happened, we have to make 
11 sure we get this documented? 
12 A This is something that we would typically 
13 see day-to-day. We see a lot of assault victims, 
14 not necessarily always regarding a police officer at 
15 work, but just anyone in general. But we do see a 
16 lot of our local police department coming in with 
17 various injuries that they sustain on-the-job. This 
18 was by no means out of the ordinary what we do see 
19 day-to-day. 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: Do you see regular people, 
21 lay people come in with a red face looking for 
22 treatment? 
23 A Yes. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Ma'am, would you also, 
25 someone who maybe reports being struck twice in the

1 face who has that type of injury that you observed. 
2 You might, you actually in this case decided to do 
3 x-rays to see if he had a fracture, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: If he had a fracture, there 
6 would be possibly other treatment involved? 
7 A Yes. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So I guess what I'm trying 
9 to get at is obviously there's potential that this, 
10 somebody wanted to document this because obviously 
11 work related injuries, people want documented, and 
12 in the event that this was, you know, again 
13 investigated in a criminal nature or to maybe 
14 ascertain whether or not there was a more severe 
15 injury than simply my jaw hurts and it's red? 
16 A Right. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
18 I have a question. 
19 Considering that you did give Naprosyn, did you feel 
20 that there was a need to prescribe an 
21 anti-inflammatory instead of just a pain killer, did 
22 you feel that the injuries looked like, you know, an 
23 anti-inflammatory was needed? 
24 A Yeah, given the injury. Usually, whether 
25 it be a contusion or a sprain or a strain, we do try

Page 97 
1 to do anti-inflammatory medicines versus like a 
2 narcotic pain reliever. Simply because it does have 
3 that anti-inflammatory effect, which generally helps 
4 with the pain and helps resolve the injury a little 
5 bit more. 
6 I kind of secondarily prescribe 
7 Naprosyn versus a narcotic because I knew that he 
8 was going to be submitting a urine drug screen and I 
9 did not want something that I gave him to interfere 
10 with that. 
11 Did you feel his injuries 
12 were consistent with the need to have an 
13 anti-inflammatory drug? 
14 A Yes. 
15 At any time did Darren 
16 Wilson mention he had already seen an EMT? 
17 A No, he did not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? 
(End of the testimony of . )

20 MS. ALIZADEH: So Kathi Alizadeh, it is 
21 about two minutes after 2:00. We just finished with 
22 the last witness of the day and you were scheduled 
23 to be here till 2:30. I think it is a good idea if 
24 you want to cut out now. 
25 We talked off the record earlier today

1 about scheduling and things that you might need 
2 because as we all have said, we're getting close to 
3 the end. Did you have a chance to talk during your 
4 lunch hour about whether or not you thought you 
5 might want some additional evidence or witnesses 
6 that you haven't heard yet or seen yet or whether or 
7 not you want to recall any witnesses that you've 
8 already heard from that you now have questions for? 
9 Did you all talk about that at all? 
10 We haven't talked about, I 
11 don't think there is anybody at this point. It is 
12 possible when we start getting into the 
13 deliberations that, you know, if there is a 
14 controversy, we may want to recall somebody. I 
15 would not expect that to be the case. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Here is our plan. Y'all 
17 are here Thursday till 5:00. As I mentioned 
18 previously, Dr. is going to be here and I 
19 think he's going to be here at 8:30. He will be the 
20 first witness of the day. We still are trying to 
21 track down up to five lay people that may or may not 
22 show up on Thursday. 
23 And then, of course, we talked about 
24 Detective being kind of the last witness who 
25 would wrap things up and kind of summarize and

1 answer any leftover questions that you might have 
2 about the investigation. 
3 I didn't realize when we started up that 
4 we didn't have all 12 grand jurors, we weren't 
5 hearing evidence, we were just talking about the end 
6 of the day has come and that if any additional 
7 witness or evidence I need you to get that to me as 
8 soon as possible. 
9 Thursday at 8:30 we are going to start 
10 
11 
with Dr. We may have some lay witnesses if I 
can find them, then may be testifying if 
12 we have the time, he's going to be the last witness 
13 of the grand jury. 
14 And then you may or may not if Thursday is 
15 our last day, you may or may not begin your 
16 deliberations then. And as I said before, you know, 
17 the end of the day is at 5:00. You want to keep 
18 going until 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, it doesn't 
19 matter to us. We're here, be here as long as you 
20 need. 
21 If you do not begin deliberations that day 
22 or if you don't complete your deliberations that 
23 day, the next day you have scheduled is the 
24 following Friday, a week, a little more than a week 
25 after that. So that would be right now the plan is

1 that if we don't finish the evidence, we will see 
2 you on that following Friday. 
3 If we do finish the evidence, it will 
4 begin deliberations and continue or you'll come back 
5 the following Friday. Is that a plan that everybody 
6 is okay with? Okay. 
7 In the meantime, I know you have asked for 
8 someone to help you in your deliberations. 
9 Obviously, things to write with and things to put on 
10 the wall. Did they show you the thing we are going 
11 to put on the wall? 
12 It is a like this, it is big enough to 
13 push pins into, but it is bigger than that. I think 
14 we might try to put a couple of these two things 
15 right here. And then if you need more, we'll get 
16 more. 
17 We're going to have a flip chart, we have 
18 the easel which is excellent and then we'll give 
19 you, you know, Posted Notes, push pins, everything 
20 else. If you want different color highlighters 
21 because you are doing that, we'll get you whatever 
22 you need. 
23 And with that, any questions at the end of 
24 the day as we are coming to a close? 
25 Also the charges, what do

1 you call them? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We're going to do that 
3 tomorrow, because we didn't have time last night and 
4 today we started up with this. Either the rest of 
5 today or by tomorrow we will give to you for 
6 indictments for you to consider and then we'll give 
7 you the law on self-defense because we've already 
8 given you the excessive force or the use of force 
9 statute. 
10 Anything else? 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: We still talking about the 
12 probable cause and that standard. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: We had a conversation with 
14 that even last night and we still have to kind of 
15 work that out, we're not really sure. 
16 Probable cause, you are 
17 still looking at? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: We both agree that you 
19 can't return an indictment unless you believe there 
20 is probable cause to believe that a crime occurred 
21 and that the defendant or suspect or the person 
22 you're considering committed it. But the question 
23 is, if you're going to consider self-defense and use 
24 of lawful use of force to affect an arrest are 
25 affirmative defenses and they're what we call

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

1 complete defenses. 
2 And so if you believe that the person 
3 acted in lawful self-defense or if you believe the 
4 person was justified in the use of force as a law 
5 enforcement officer, then it is a complete defense, 
6 there would be no indictment on any charge. 
7 The question we don't really know is that 
8 beyond a reasonable doubt, what is the standard by 
9 which you have to consider that. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Those two issues. 10 
11 Will that be outlined in 
12 writing for us as well? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't know because we 
14 don't know. If this matter were a trial, it would 
15 be different because, obviously, in trial it is 
16 beyond a reasonable doubt. And in trial it is the 
17 obligation of the defense to raise the issue, and if 
18 the issue is raised, it becomes the obligation of 
19 the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
20 the person did not act in lawful self-defense or was 
21 not justified in the use of force, but that's in a 
22 trial setting. 
23 So we don't know how this, this 
24 investigation was, we talked about yesterday, is not 
25 typical on how we would present cases to the grand

1 jury. This is an investigation and I believe, and I 
2 think Sheila agrees, I don't want to speak for you, 
3 that your determination of whether or not force was 
4 justified either as self-defense or use of force to 
5 affect an arrest is a part of your decision process. 
6 So that's something for you to consider. 
7 I don't think the answer is simply, well, we believe 
8 that a crime was committed, you know, probable cause 
9 to believe a crime was committed and he did it and 
10 not at all talk about those defenses. 
11 But I don't know, we don't know what kind 
12 of instruction to give you on, do you have to 
13 believe that there's probable cause to believe that 
14 he used excessive force. I don't know, we don't 
15 know that. We don't want to tell you the wrong 
16 thing. So we're still trying to work that out. 
17 Okay. I hope I haven't said too much. We 
18 want you to make the right decision, we want your 
19 decision to be based on the law. And given that 
20 neither Sheila nor I have ever had this experience 
21 before and actually, we talked, there's only been 
22 one grand jury investigation on officer's use of 
23 force in the past 15 years that anybody can 
24 remember, so we're kind of not sure how to proceed.
