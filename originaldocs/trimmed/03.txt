GRAND JURY HEARING

2 MS. ALIZADEH: Good afternoon. For the 
3 record, I'm Kathi Alizadeh with the Prosecutor's 
4 Office. Also present is Sheila Whirley with the 
5 Prosecutor's Office, and all 12 jurors are present 
6 today and as well as the court reporter who is 
7 taking down everything that's being said as well as 
8 audio recording the proceedings that are going on 
9 this afternoon. 
10 As you can tell, we've kind of rearranged. 
11 We're trying to figure out how to best work the room 
12 with the equipment that we have. 
13 As you can see this screen kind of moves. 
14 Do you see the wind, the air blowing on it? It is 
15 blowing on the screen, but not on you, 
16 unfortunately. So we're going to try this out. 
17 If this is too annoying, we'll next time 
18 try something else out, but this is a bigger screen 
19 and we thought maybe it would be easier for 
20 everybody to see it. If everybody gets car sick 
21 because pictures are kind of wiggling on there, we 
22 will figure something out. 
23 Also, and we have some additional fans, 
24 I'm going to try to bring another fan in tomorrow to 
25 make it a little more comfortable. I'm doing the

1 best I can as far as the heating and cooling. 
2 So my understanding that you all are going 
3 to be able to be seated today from 1:00 to 5:00; is 
4 that correct? And so for today we've scheduled two 
5 witnesses. The first witness is here and it will be 
6 another crime scene detective. 
7 His name is Detective 
8 And then the second witness that's 
9 going to testify is the medical examiner who 
10 conducted the autopsy, his name is Dr. and 
11 because of his schedule, I'm going to tell 
12 Dr. probably isn't going to be here until 
13 two, he's going to get here as soon as he can. 
14 If we're not done with Detective 
15 we are just going to interrupt his testimony because 
16 he can very easily come back on another day. It is 
17 hard for me to get the doctor here. He is going to 
18 be going out of town, so we might have to interrupt 
19 Detective and bring him back to finish up 
20 with whatever questions or additional we have with 
21 him, okay? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
So with that being said.

15 
16 
17 
Q How long have you been a police officer? 
A 33 years. 
Q Okay. Now, Detective you are kind 
18 of a soft spoken person a little bit. I want to 
19 make sure that everybody back here can hear him and 
20 if you cannot hear him, please raise your hand and 
21 let us know if you can't hear him. 
22 I don't think the microphone 
23 amplifies, it is recording actually. So you 
24 probably just have to keep your voice up a little 
25 bit.

14 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are you a training officer for crime scene 
15 detectives? 
16 A Yes, both in division patrol and also the 
17 crime scene unit. For the past 27 years, I've been 
18 a field training instructor. 
19 I also teach the basic and advance 
20 crime scene schools at our police academy and I also 
21 lecture at four area schools and universities. 
22 Q And is there a board certification for

3 Q Were you working then as a crime scene 
4 investigator for St. Louis County on August 9th of 
5 this year? 
6 A I was. 
7 Q And did you receive a call sometime in the 
8 early afternoon of that day to respond regarding a 
9 police involved shooting? 
A I did. 
Q About what time did you get that call? 
10 
11 
12 A Uh, about 1:00 p.m. I was notified at home 
13 by my supervisor to respond to our office, which is 
14 in north county, to retrieve a crime scene van and 
15 then contact one of our crimes against person 
16 detectives at Christian Northwest Hospital. 
17 Q So did you go from your home to the office 
18 to pick up a crime scene van? 
19 
20

Q 
I did, I arrived about 2:20p.m. 
And did you make contact with a detective, 
10 now you say crimes against person, are you all 
11 familiar with the bureau in St. Louis County? The 
12 detective bureau is divided up into separate 
13 distinct units, crimes against persons is a unit 
14 that deals with, obviously, crimes against persons, 
15 but it would be homicides, assaults, rapes and so 
16 forth. 
17 So Detective when you got to 
18 the hospital, who did you contact? 
19 
20 
21

One of our detectives by the name of 
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson was 
23 there, the assist chief of Ferguson Police 
24 Department and an attorney for the paternal order of 
25 police for Mr. Wilson.

4 A Based on the information that I received, 
5 I was to document visible injuries or complaint 
6 sites of injury on Darren Wilson. We were to 
7 document his clothing. I was going to seize his 
8 clothing and also the weapon that he carried that 
9 day. 
10 At some point in time I was also 
11 tasked with the processing of the Ferguson police 
12 vehicle, which was a fully marked Tahoe.

1 A I asked him what areas hurt other than 
2 what I was seeing. He went through several sites 
3 that he complained of injuries. I retrieved the ER 
4 charge nurse to make sure that I wasn't missing 
5 anything as far as the ER staff doing their initial 
6 assessment of Darren Wilson. 
7 Q So you spoke with the charge nurse, do you 
8 recall his name? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No, I do not. 
Did he indicate to you that there were 
11 additional injuries that you did not assess or not 
12 see? 
13 A No, we walked through with Darren Wilson 
14 his injury complaint sites, consisting of mainly his 
15 facial area, the back of his neck and he said his 
16 head hurt. 
17 Q Did you photograph the areas that he 
18 indicated hurt? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
I did. 
Now, we also heard Detective 
21 yesterday, not yesterday, I keep saying yesterday, 
22 previously, about when he photographs crime scenes,

1 A Correct. There's a standard format that 
2 we teach in the crime scene school and we also teach 
3 during our field training program. 
4 There's a normal sequencing event. In 
5 this case you take overall pictures, you take what's 
6 called midrange pictures to tie in that location to 
7 something else that's recognizable, you will take a 
8 specific image and in these kind of circumstances 
9 you'll also put a measuring device or a scale in 
10 your information to give you an idea of how large 
11 this area is or how small this area is.

13 photographing the injuries on Darren Wilson?

I did. 
And did you have those, I can't remember, 
20 do you burn it onto a desk or do you take the memory 
21 card to the lab? 
22 A No, the memory card is placed in, in the 
23 old days referred to as a film envelope, and then 
24 that was hand carried by myself to our photo lab.

2 completed, on homicide cases, officer involved 
3 shootings and other cases of note, they will print 
4 the photo lab, meaning they, will print 8 X 10

7 those images are reviewed my me and then they are

11 you and I get this envelope yesterday, did you 
12 recognize this from my office yesterday? 
13 A We did. When I stamp these photographs, I 
14 fill out the front of this with a header information 
15 as far as date, complaint number, what type of 
16 incident it is, and in this scenario since I went to 
17 three different locations, those three different 
18 locations are also marked on front of the envelope.

3 Q Did you all arrive at the Ferguson Police 
4 Department at around the same time? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q When you got there, what's the first thing 
7 you did? 
A After meeting with Detective Darren 8 
9 Wilson, Lieutenant Colonel we entered 
10 Ferguson Police Department and went to their 
11 detective bureau. 
12 I was told that's where Officer 
13 Wilson or Darren Wilson's department issued firearm 
14 was, his uniform shirt and that's where we were 
15 making arrangements to have clothes brought to him 
16 so I could document the uniform that he was wearing 
17 and also seize those uniform pants from him. 
18 Q And so when you went into the detective 
19 bureau, did you locate the weapon? 
20 A Yes, I inquired of its whereabouts and I 
21 was told that someone had placed Darren Wilson's 
22 department issued side arm in an evidence envelope, 
23 which wasn't sealed. It was on a desk there in the 
24 detective bureau with other detectives from that 
25 department present.

4 Q And you said it wasn't sealed, did you 
5 remove the contents of the envelope? 
6 A I did. 
7 Q What was inside the envelope? 
8 A His department issued Sig Saur firearm, 
9 the magazine and one live round, and that's how the 
10 firearm was placed in that envelope. I did not 
11 download that weapon when I inquired about it. I 
12 was told that Darren Wilson had downloaded the 
13 weapon and then probably at the direction of the 
14 supervisor, it was placed in that envelope and 
15 merely for conveyance purposes, I assumed from the 
16 scene back to Ferguson Police Department until I 
17 arrived.

19 correct?

Q

Yes. 
And you all know what that means, 
3 downloading, other than like on the internet, can 
4 you explain what that means for the jurors? 
5 A Sure. When you download a semiautomatic 
6 weapon for our terminology, that means that the 
7 magazine is removed, all rounds that are in the 
8 magazine and whatever is chambered is removed and 
9 the slide is locked back. That's a safe way to

5 laid on top of the Ferguson Police Department's 
6 evidence envelope in exactly the condition that I 
7 removed it from. 
8 Q You and I talked about this yesterday, 
9 what's this thing right here? 
10 A That is just part of the seal on the back 
11 of their evidence envelope. I did not apply that 
12 and nor was it sealed.

3 A As a general rule, I always wear two sets 
4 of gloves. If the first set becomes contaminated or 
5 in this case, if I was to swab this for any other 
6 potential forensic evidence. That first set is 
7 removed before I move onto the next step and then 
8 another set of gloves is put on so I don't run the 
9 risk of cross-contamination.

14 So the envelope, 
15 it was your understanding that was the first time it

1 clarification. What is the protocol for when you 
2 seize a weapon and it is placed in the evidence bag 
3 to be inspected, what's the protocol as far as 
4 putting it in there and everything else after that? 
5 A I can speak for the County Police 
6 Department, I can't speak for another agency, okay. 
7 We do not package firearms in this manner. 
8 If I go to a scene and there's a 
9 firearm laying there, okay. There's a standard 
10 protocol that we always follow, and I think you may 
11 have seen some of those from Detective 
12 We'll take an overall view, we'll 
13 take what is called a midrange view to tie in that 
14 firearm, if we are talking about bag this, where it 
15 is on this section of the table. The overall view 
16 would be the entire room, okay. Midrange view would 
17 say, well, it is near these two jurors and these two 
18 microphones. 
19 Then we would take a close-up view of 
20 it, but it is still in place. We have not 
21 manipulated it, we have not touched it and then what 
22 you folks will see here shortly we follow the same 
23 protocols as far as images. 
24 Once it is photographed in place, 
25 then wearing gloves, we will pick it up, usually lay

1 it on another surface, whether it is an evidence 
2 envelope or evidence box, which would be the County 
3 Police Department. We don't put fires arms in a 
4 package. 
5 And then we would lay that firearm, 
6 we would photograph both sides, we would take an 
7 image of the serial number, we would remove the 
8 magazine, photograph all of these things as they 
9 are, and then we would unload the magazines and 
10 whatever rounds in the magazine. We would display 
11 them next to the magazine to document, well, these 
12 are the rounds that we found in there. 
13 We would then lock the slide back and 
14 whatever is in the chamber or not in the chamber 
15 then we would document that. 
16 We would package those items 
17 separately, but they all go into one gun box. 
18 If we were to seize this and render 
19 it safe, then it would be inspected by another 
20 detective or one of my supervisors to confirm 
21 Detective looked at this gun and he cleared 
22 it, and I'm checking to make sure that it is cleared 
23 so everyone is safe.

2 here. And per our firearms unit, we would put in 
3 essence, it is a orange zip tie that runs from, if I 
4 can change images, Miss Alizadeh? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Sure, just identify the 
6 image you are going to put up there. 
7 A The next image is Number 21. This is the 
8 other side of the weapon. Again, our normal 
9 sequence. And right here would be the ejection 
10 port, that orange zip tie would initiate going 
11 through here, it comes out of the bottom of the 
12 magazine, goes in and then we would secure that. 
13 Then it is sent to the firearms unit 
14 to verify when that gun gets there, that it couldn't 
15 have accidently slide, go forward, it could have 
16 been knocked around or something. And we want to 
17 confirm when it goes to our crime lab personnel that 
18 that gun is safe, has been inspected and has been 
19 confirmed.

I have the question about 
3 the clothing. Is it common practice to have 
4 somebody travel from one spot to another before you 
5 take the clothing, I mean, I'm wondering is there a 
6 reason why somebody couldn't bring that to the 
7 hospital where he was instead of having him travel 
8 somewhere else before he got there for his clothing.

10 was Ferguson's decision. If I was to work, and I've 
11 worked hundreds, if that was a County Police

14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Does anybody, the first 
15 image of the weapon was Photograph Number 20, does 
16 anybody need that back up? We are moving back now 
17 for 21, which has been on the screen. Describe what 
18 you are seeing? 
19 A That is the other side or the right side 
20 of the weapon, the slide locked back. Visible in it 
21 serial number, as I explained earlier. 
22 And Image 22 is a close-up view of 
23 that serial number. You folks may not be able to 
24 see that. We can certainly pass that around. I 
25 don't know how to make that clearer.

That's great. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) I kind of skipped over 
10 that, let's talk about that right now. 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Sure. 
So when you were, were you told that there 
13 was a physical struggle over this weapon? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
I was. 
And were you told that Michael Brown may 
16 have had his hands on the weapon? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So was there some discussion between you 
19 and other officers about swabbing versus 
20 fingerprinting? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
There was. 
Okay. Have you all had a fingerprint 
23 expert testify before you before? 
24 (All jurors indicate no.)

1 firearm, how would you go about examining that, do 
2 you want those firearm pictures again? 
3 A Just let me have one of them please, 
4 ma'am. 
5 Q How would you go about looking on that 
6 weapon for fingerprints? 
7 A Okay. Based on the information that I was 
8 told regarding the incident, I was informed that 
9 Darren Wilson while holding his firearm, his 
10 department issue pistol, while he's holding it, 
11 there was a struggle between Mr. Brown and 
12 Mr. Wilson while the officer was seated in his 
13 police vehicle and Mr. Brown was outside. 
14 So if you take that and say okay, 
15 well, the officer is holding his gun, he never 
16 relinquished it, the gun was never taken away, 
17 however, we are wrestling over this gun. 
18 Common sense would tell you that if 
19 I'm holding the handle of the gun here, then what 
20 opportunity or what else is the other person 
21 struggling over. Probably this area of the gun. 
22 The magazine was never released from 
23 the gun during the incident, it was never dropped or 
24 picked up, the officer never lost control of his 
25 gun.

1 If you have a violent event like 
2 that, you have to make a decision whether you are 
3 concerned about hopefully getting a DNA profile or 
4 the possibility of retrieving latent fingerprint 
5 evidence. 
6 Q Let me stop you really quick here. We are 
7 going to finish him up describing this because our 
8 doctor is here, but I'm going to let him finish this 
9 area about the fingerprint versus swabbing. 
10 Now, I want to clarify that the 
11 things that you are talking about concerning a 
12 struggle over the gun, that is not from your 
13 firsthand knowledge, correct? 
14

17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And not Darren Wilson? 
Correct. 
And then you are making some assumptions 
21 about where you might fingerprint based upon just 
22 common sense and your experience? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. So this is not to say that this is 
25 how it happened, but this is based upon your

1 experience and what you have been told at this point 
2 where you might expect to find fingerprints? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q Okay. You can then go ahead and talk 
5 about, you have to make kind of a decision between 
6 whether to swab for DNA or to look for fingerprints? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q So why did you make a decision to swab for 
9 DNA? 
10 A Based on training and experience, and also 
11 based on the information that I was given, you're 
12 not going to have fine ridge detail during a violent 
13 encounter. It would be different if this gun was 
14 like this and someone just came up, other than the 
15 officer, and touched it. 
16 When we process that, yes, you can 
17 get fine ridge detail. So the decision was made 
18 between myself and the crimes against person 
19 detective, homicide detective, that it would be 
20 better to swab the weapon. 
21 Now, if you are going to swab it, 
22 then you need to swab all the relevant areas that 
23 could be touched by someone other than Darren 
24 Wilson. 
25 Q Because, of course, you know Darren Wilson

Q 
A

A 
Q 
A 
Exactly, he was holding it. 
It would tell you nothing if his DNA is on 
Absolutely not. 
We know he touched the gun? 
Right, it is his gun. 
All right. 
Once that decision is made and you swab, 
10 then you're going to have to swab those areas that 
11 were described earlier. If there was fingerprint 
12 evidence, you are going to be swabbing through them, 
13 so that's why you need to make a decision whether 
14 you want to process this for fingerprints or do you 
15 want to process this for DNA. 
16 Q And in processing this weapon for 
17 fingerprints, could you after that swab it for DNA? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No. 
So you had to pick one or the other? 
Right. 
And based upon your information and 
22 consulting with the detective, crime scene 
23 detective, not crime scene, crimes against person 
24 homicide detective, was a decision made to swab for 
25 DNA?

Yes. 
4 Q Did you package those swabs in the regular 
5 manner? 
6 A I did. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you have any questions 
8 about his processing this gun or about the gun 
9 itself or anything like that? 
10 Did you 
11 describe what type of gun is it again? 
12 A It is a Sig Sauer P229. It is a .40 
13 caliber weapon. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Just so you know and, of 
15 course, he is familiar with this weapon, but we will 
16 be calling, you know, someone from the crime lab 
17 that is an expert on ballistics and can answer all 
18 kind of questions about this weapon and how it fires 
19 and so forth. 
20 Once you swab 
21 the critical areas for DNA, is all of the DNA at 
22 that point removed from the object basically, it is 
23 rendered clean? 
24 A You might have a trace only because these 
25 are cotton swabs and when we swab something, we do

3 potentially a defense attorney so we keep one on

5 When you are holding these two cotton 
6 swabs, if you folks can picture Q-Tips, okay. You 
7 are holding two of them together, unless you're 
8 going back and forth and completely swabbing every 
9 little spot on this thing, you're not going to 
10 remove all of the DNA, all right. 
11 You're trying to get the most profile 
12 or profiles that you can by swabbing those areas 
13 back and forth. Kind of like painting a first coat, 
14 you're not going to paint, you're not going to cover 
15 everything with your first coat. The same thing 
16 applies when we're swabbing for DNA. So potentially 
17 could be DNA left on there, but we try to get the 
18 largest sample as we can.

4 you collect evidence and you get the bag, all the 
5 evidence is in the bag and you seal the bag until 
6 the right person comes and inspects the bag? 
7 A Again, I can speak for the County Police 
8 Department, yes. What I was told, the information 
9 that I was given is that it was just placed there 
10 for, in essence, conveyance or storage until I got 
11 there. 
12 And then, obviously, when I arrived 
13 and I processed or I seized or I package something, 
14 then I follow what the County Police Department 
15 crime scene unit and our crimes lab protocol as far 
16 as how we package things.

1 shooting? 
A No, ma'am. 2 
3 Q In fact, Ferguson had asked county to come 
4 in and take over this investigation within maybe an 
5 hour of the shooting, would that be your 
6 understanding? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And so to your knowledge, did any Ferguson 
9 crime scene detectives have anything to do with 
10 seizing evidence, processing any scenes? 
11 A No, ma'am, that's why they requested my 
12 unit to respond. 
13 Q And so I'm only guessing or speculating, 
14 had a Ferguson crime scene detective actually seized 
15 this weapon, he might have handled it in a different 
16 manner than what was done in this case, would that 
17 be a guess or fair to say? 
18 A That would be accurate because Ferguson 
19 Police Department has sent some of their officers to 
20 the crime scene school that I teach at our academy. 
21 I'm confident in stating that they would probably 
22 have followed protocols if they were actually 
23 seizing pieces of evidence.

1 Yes. You 
2 may have said it, who actually put the gun into the 
3 envelope? 
4 
5 
A I have no idea. 
Okay. Would there be an 
6 issue when you do the swab of somebody else's DNA on 
7 the gun. 
8 A What I was told is that Darren Wilson had 
9 unloaded his own weapon, so if he handed it to 
10 someone else, I was never informed of that. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, I will tell you we 
12 will have DNA people testify and they will tell you 
13 what DNA was found on that gun and if they can 
14 identify whose DNA it was. 
15 So as far as that goes and let me ask you, 
16 Detective did you take a swab from Darren 
17 Wilson at the hospital. 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So there was a sample of 
20 Darren Wilson's DNA taken by you at the hospital? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that is done by rubbing something on 
23 the inside of his cheek?

Yes, it is called a buccal swab. 
And you are fully gloved?

1 Q And so when you began working for the 
2 County Medical Examiner's Office, was there any 
3 training that you underwent or any on-the-job 
4 training that you had to go through when you first 
5 began? 
6 A Urn, I mean, the main thing that's 
7 important is that you've done a certified or 
8 approved forensic fellow, which I did do at St. 
9 Louis University through their system at the St. 
10 Louis City Medical Examiner's Office. So that's the 
11 main thing that you do need, plus your medical 
12 degree and eventually being board certified to be 
13 able to practice what I practice at. 
14 Q And so in probably, what I would say in 
15 layman's terms, one of your chief duties and 
16 responsibilities is to perform autopsies, correct? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And just we all think we know what an 
19 autopsy is, but can you explain for the jurors in 
20 general when you have a deceased person how you 
21 begin an autopsy? 
22 A The autopsy itself, it is kind of layman's 
23 terms just for the general examination that occurs 
24 that I have for a case and it entails a lot of 
25 features depending on the circumstances, some things

1 are not done or done, but in a complete sense of an 
2 autopsy, you do an external examination, which is 
3 looking at the external features of the body with 
4 the clothes on and then removed. 
5 Once they are removed, you want to 
6 look at any type of identifying characteristic, any 
7 kind of scar, any type of wounds, any type of 
8 tattoos, anything that you can physically see on the 
9 body that may be an abnormality or be something 
10 different, that's the external portion of the 
11 examination. 
12 That is then ultimately followed with 
13 an internal examination where you are actually 
14 assessing all of the organs, weighing the organs 
15 looking at the organs to see if you see any type of 
16 pathological or disease type changes, any type of 
17 injuries on the inside of the body. 
18 In terms of different ancillary 
19 studies that would be things that are in addition to 
20 external, as well as the internal examination we do 
21 toxicology, that's taking fluids from the body just 
22 in a general sense, blood, urine, fluid from the 
23 (listen) eyes where that fluid is tested to see if 
24 there is any type of drugs, any type of toxins 
25 within the body.

1 The body is x-rayed some time to look 
2 for any type of fracture, in homicide to see if 
3 there is any type of projectiles within the body or 
4 any type of knives or things of that nature. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
And by projectile, you mean like a bullet? 
Correct, like a bullet. Other things that 
7 are done, sometimes I do cultures, that is just 
8 looking for any type of bacteria or viral packaging 
9 that may be in the body, that may be the cause of 
10 death. Medical records, if they are present, I will 
11 review those as well and sometimes I have to use 
12 histology, which is looking at actual tissue that 
13 has been processed to be able to look under a 
14 microscope, where I look under the microscope and 
15 then I can make a diagnosis of different type of 
16 disease changes. 
17 So those are kind of the basic things 
18 that go into an autopsy and as I said, sometimes all 
19 of those things are used, and sometimes bits and 
20 pieces are used, but more the most part complete 
21 external examination, internal examination and the 
22 toxicology, that's pretty much routine on all cases. 
23 Q And now you are not the toxicologist; is 
24 that correct? 
25 A That is correct.

1 Q 
Page 57 
You just collect the samples that are then 
2 tested by a toxicologist? 
3 A That is correct. 
4 Q Now, prior to your beginning and autopsy, 
5 do you receive information from anyone about the 
6 deceased that may assist you in knowing what you are 
7 looking at and what to look for? 
A Yes, I did. 8 
9 Q And in this case did you have a 
10 conversation with 
A Yes, I did. 11 
12 Q Is he one of the investigators from the 
13 Medical Examiner's Office? 
A Yes, he is. 14 
15 Q Now, in this particular case, did you 
16 examine the body of Michael Brown? 
17 A Yes, I did. 
18 Q What day did you examine him? 
19 A August lOth. 
20 Q So this would be the day after the 
21 shooting, correct? 
22 A Correct. 
23 Q Now, in every autopsy that you perform, 
24 are there police officers there during the autopsy? 
25 A Not every autopsy I perform.

1 Q In a situation where there might be 
2 criminal activity involved in this person's death, 
3 is there always a police officer who is present for 
4 the autopsy? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, there is. 
And are you familiar with some of the St. 
7 Louis County crime detectives, crime scene 
8 investigators? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, I'm familiar with them. 
And are those generally, well not 
11 generally, do they on occasion attend the autopsies? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, they do. 
And are you present when a police officer 
14 is photographing the autopsy? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes, I am. 
Do you at times direct the officer, you 
17 know, get a picture of this because this shows this? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
And then if you are removing anything 
20 foreign from the body, do you then, does the officer 
21 document that object? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, he does. 
Does typically the officer would then 
24 seize those objects if there was anything seized 
25 from the body that might be evidentiary in nature?

Q

Yes, they do. 
So you're not, your job is not collection 
3 of evidence? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
No. 
But there is someone present during the 
6 entire autopsy whose job is there to collect 
7 evidence? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. Now, in this particular case, this 
10 autopsy performed on Michael Brown, what information 
11 did you have from that was something 
12 that you considered prior to beginning the autopsy? 
13 A Urn, when I was contacted by 
14 he called me on my personal cell phone to let me 
15 know what particular cases came in on his shift and 
16 he informed me of the cases that came on his shift, 
17 and one of the cases was Mr. Michael Brown. 
18 The circumstances that I got from him 
19 were very brief and minimal. At that particular 
20 time he informed me that there was a police 
21 shooting. He mentioned to me that there appears to 
22 have been a struggle and that was kind of the extent 
23 of the information that I had at that particular 
24 time. 
25 So from that point, I know that the

1 body is going to have to come in for examination due 
2 to the nature of the particular type of event. 
3 There is certain cases that are under 
4 my jurisdiction as a medical examiner and that 
5 particular case of Mr. Michael Brown fit that 
6 jurisdiction, so I knew that that case was going to 
7 come in for examination. 
8 Q Are you aware that Missouri has a statute 
9 that says that the actual body and its possessions 
10 of a deceased person are the property of the Medical 
11 Examiner's Office? 
A Yes, I am. 12 
13 Q And so in this particular case, well, let 
14 me back up. 
15 You're aware that 
16 ultimately prepared a report, correct? 
A Yes. 17 
18 Q But he didn't have his report prepared 
19 when you first began your examination; is that 
20 correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And did you see any other police 
23 reports or any other reports about this incident 
24 before you began your examination? 
25 A No, I did not.

1 Q Did you get any other information from 
2 anywhere else, whether it be a police officer or 
3 witnesses or anybody else? 
4 A Before I started my examination, Detective 
5 was present at my autopsy 
6 examination and I did ask him about the 
7 circumstances that he knew at that particular time. 
8 Q What did he tell you about what he knew at 
9 that time? 
10 A Trying to remember exactly, it is a while 
11 back, but it was just basically similar situation of 
12 there were two gentlemen in the street, police 
13 officer responded to that particular area, from that 
14 point in time a struggle ensued and then after that 
15 things were difficult to determine at that point in 
16 time, but ultimately it ended in the result of 
17 Mr. Michael Brown obtaining fatal wounds. 
18 Q Okay. And so jumping forward now, at the 
19 conclusion of an autopsy, do you prepare a report? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
And is that report reviewed by anyone else 
22 in your office? 
23 A Urn, there's a secretary who transcribes 
24 the information that I speak into a digital 
25 recorder, but it is my words and she transcribes my

7 prior to your testimony today? 
8 
9

Yes, you did. 
This is a list of terms of anatomic 
10 orientation. In your report, you use terms that I 
11 would say a layperson isn't going to be familiar 
12 with, would that be fair to say? 
13 
14 
A 
Q

And when you are autopsying a body, is it 
15 one of your jobs and responsibilities to describe 
16 the location of a wound? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. 
And if it is some kind of piercing wound,

20 describe the path of that wound or the trajectory so 
21 to speak of that wound? 
22 
23

12 take, go ahead and take those notes in your

That is correct. 
And was there another detective there who

11 autopsy is completed, is it a standard, I'm sorry, 
12 and in the case when the police are also involved in 
13 the autopsies as far as documenting things, does the 
14 Medical Examiner's Office receive a complete copy of 
15 the photographs that the police took at the autopsy? 
16

Yes, we do.

Now, we've already done this a couple of

7 you would sit in that chair there and take those and 
8 have them on your lap. 
9 And when we talk about these, now we 
10 have already had some testimony from some crime 
11 scene detectives about these photographs, and 
12 including the fact that each photograph has a number 
13 on the back of it. And so when I refer to the 
14 photographs, since I haven't marked these

1 placard that was prepared by the officer who took 
2 these photographs and that would be his DSN down at 
3 the bottom And my knowledge is that that is 
4 Detective And if necessary he can 
5 testify about taking these photographs if you need 
6 to hear from him about what he's done. 
7 But, of course, it is going to have 
8 to be the doctor who testifies about what we are 
9 seeing in these photographs for the most part. So 
10 Image Number 1 is the placard. 
11 Can you put Image Number 2 up there,

So when the body 
11 leaves the scene, is it taken directly to your 
12 offices or where is the examining on the lOth, what 
13 happens between when it is collected and this day? 
14 A The body is picked up from a delivery 
15 service, delivery service is responsible for picking 
16 the body up from the scene. At that point when the 
17 body is picked up from the scene, it is brought 
18 directly to the St. Louis County Medical Examiner 
19 and it is placed in the morgue, in a cooler, until 
20 eventually I'm going to come for the examination.

22 comes in and it is checked in by the morgue staff or 
23 it is given a number, and just to make sure that it 
24 is logged in appropriately and put into the morgue, 
25 but the body goes into the cooler to wait until the

Q 
You are welcome. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So when the body was 
7 removed from the cooler, was it still locked in the 
8 bag? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
We heard talk about the fact that 
11 there is a lock placed on the bag at the scene by 
12 him? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
After the body is received at the Medical 
15 Examiner's Office, does anyone before your autopsy 
16 begins unlock that bag? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
No. 
If that lock had been disturbed or broken 
19 or opened when you began your autopsy, would you 
20 have noted that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so when you open the body bag, this is 
23 the body of Michael Brown as it appeared when you 
24 open the body bag?

That is correct. 
So after that has happened and the officer 
12 has photographed what we see in Image Number 2, what 
13 happens next? 
14 A Urn, at this point, in theory and in terms 
15 of normal protocol or in terms of how I approach the 
16 case, at this point I will eventually myself start 
17 looking at the body, start the initial external 
18 examination that I spoke with you all at the 
19 beginning where I am looking at the clothing that 
20 the particular decedent has on. And just stating 
21 how the body appears to me, at least initially, in 
22 terms of clothing and that would be the next step. 
23 Q Okay. And so let's move through the 
24 photographs as we go and Image Number 3? 
25 A Yes, this is Image Number 3.

1 Q So just describe, if you briefly want to 
2 describe what we are seeing here? 
3 A This is just the decedent, Mr. Michael 
4 Brown, from the other side of his body, looking from 
5 the other angle before the angle is just flip 
6 flopped. So it is just the other side, you are 
7 looking at the right side of his body as opposed to 
8 the first image which was the left side of his body. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. Image Number 4? 
Image Number 4 is just kind of an overall 
11 view of Mr. Michael Brown's face as he is as soon as 
12 the bag is removed to expose his face and rest of 
13 his upper body. 
14 Q And this up here, that's the placard that 
15 you were talking about? 
16 A That's the identifying placard that was 
17 prepared by St. Louis County Police Department, this 
18 is Mr. Michael Brown's face. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. And Image Number 5? 
Image Number 5. So this is, we actually 
21 have a ladder in the actual morgue suite where you 
22 are able to get a higher vantage point to be able to 
23 get a larger view of the body. 
24 So the officer in this particular 
25 case has got on top of the ladder, he is doing an

1 overall of Mr. Michael Brown where you can see at 
2 least down to the mid thigh, from the head down to 
3 the mid thigh and seeing the arms and the torso, and 
4 here is the identifying placard again. 
5 Q Let me stop you here. As you say the body 
6 was, you know, the bag was opened and you examined 
7 it, are the clothes disturbed for the purposes of 
8 these photograph? 
9 A No, the clothes were not disturbed. This 
10 is how they are maintained within the bag as soon as 
11 it is opened. 
12 Q So nobody lifted up the shirt, nobody 
13 pulled the pants down, that's how it was when you 
14 first saw it? 
A Correct. 15 
16 Q Okay. At this point, are you the one who 
17 puts the body onto the table? 
18 A Urn, so from here, he was placed on this 
19 table initially within the morgue cooler, it is on 
20 wheels. So when it comes out, he is staying on here 
21 the entire time. So the entire autopsy is going to 
22 start coming from the cooler, to this part where you 
23 are seeing the pictures, to me actually doing my 
24 incisions and remove organs, so he stays on this 
25 table the entire time.

Image Number 6. So this is still a view 
3 from the ladder where the officer is taking 
4 pictures, here is that identifying placard and here 
5 is a shot from the head would be here, the feet are 
6 down here and you can see the hands and you can see 
7 the rest of the lower extremities of Mr. Michael 
8 Brown and what he was wearing. 
9 Q Now, there is a white object that's 
10 affixed to his right ankle, do you know what that 
11 is? 
12 A These are added to the body just as 
13 identifiers to make sure we know whose who when they 
14 are coming in for examination.

1 and upper body. 
Q Okay. Number 8? 2 
3 A This is number 8. So we are looking at 
4 the right side of Mr. Michael Brown's face and you 
5 can see the shirt that he's wearing and you can see 
6 the right side of his face. 
7 Q Number 9? 
8 A This is Image Number 9. And this is 
9 predominantly, you know, this is the right side of 
10 the face here, the left side would be here off of 
11 the view of the picture. So you can see some of the 
12 injuries here to the right side of the face. 
13 Q Now, before I get too far ahead of 
14 ourselves here, do you have other images in this 
15 stack that better document the injury that you 
16 documented? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
So you haven't, in other words, you 
19 haven't cleaned him up?

22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No, that is correct. 
And at some point do you clean him up?

And is it easier to visualize the injuries 
24 after that?

1 Q Okay. So we'll go through these and then 
2 we will talk about the injuries when we have the 
3 other photographs. And that is Number 9 is next, I 
4 think? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. This is Number 10. 
Yes, that's right. This one is Number 9, 
7 you've got Number 10 up there on the screen? 
8 A Yes. This is similar image to what I just 
9 showed. We are still looking at the right side of 
10 the face and what has been introduced here by the 
11 officer who is taking the photos. He has introduced 
12 a ruler, the ruler is important for scale in order 
13 to if you want to go back in time to say how big or 
14 how small things are, that's the purpose of the 
15 ruler that has been introduced into this picture. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Okay. And the next would be Number 11? 
So this image is flip flopped a little 
18 bit, mouth and the nose would be up here, the top of 
19 the head is here, we are still looking at the right 
20 side of the face and then you still have this ruler 
21 that has been introduced into the picture. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. Number 12? 
This is Image Number 12. Now, we're 
24 seeing a little bit more of the left side of the 
25 face, but still predominantly focused on the right

an injury here on the right side of the 
Number 14? 
This is Image Number 14. Similar to the 
that I just showed you. The only 
12 difference is the ruler has been inserted into the 
13 photograph for scale. So we are looking at the 
14 right side of the face, again, focusing on this 
15 wound. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Number 15? 
Image Number 15. Flipped upside down, but 
18 the mouth would be here, the top of the head is down 
19 here, once again focusing on the right side of the 
20 face depicting injuries. 
21 Image Number 16. So we're looking at 
22 the right side of the body, there was a similar 
23 image of this before, but the feet are down here, 
24 the head is up here, this is the right side of the 
25 body.

13 here, the head is up here, you have the right arm 
14 being extended kind of perpendicular in a 90 degree 
15 angle from the table. The hand is up here, the 
16 shoulder would be down there. And we have these 
17 wounds here near the forearm, this is the forearm.

23 
Q

Number 19? 
This is Number 19. We are looking at, do 
24 you want me to just go through the picture or you 
25 want me to reference them to my report at this

A 
This is prior to being cleaned up or not? 
It is kind of in between. It is a little

Q

Q 
Okay. I can just go back and pull them 
We can pull them out? 
Okay. 
And, Doctor, is it your habit when you 
14 begin to describe injuries, do you like start from 
15 the head and work your way down, or do you just pick 
16 a certain way to describe them? 
17 A Urn, my usual approach is, I kind of go in 
18 terms of more significant injuries to the least 
19 significant. So I typically will start with the 
20 things that look to me to be, you know, more 
21 immediately impactful to the life of an individual. 
22 So when I get to the situation where 
23 I have wounds of the arms and things of that nature, 
24 those would be further down in my report. That's my 
25 typical approach when I do cases.

1 Q Okay. So we've scene the photographs of 
2 the head and the side of the body, and now we are 
3 looking at injuries to the right arm? 
4 A To the arm, yes. So this is the right 
5 forearm and there is an injury right here where they 
6 introduce the ruler scale in this particular photo. 
7 This is Image Number 20. We're still 
8 looking at the right forearm and this is on that

12 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley.

2 And the next Number is 21, I think, 21, yeah?

5 that wound here on the forearm and then here is 
6 another one on the right forearm. 
7 Is this 22? 
Q Yeah. 8 
9 A This is Image 22. So we're backing up a 
10 little bit and it is kind of hard, I can see it on 
11 my picture, we will get a little bit closer. So the 
12 head of Mr. Michael Brown is here, this is still his 
13 right arm, and this is like his torso here. What 
14 I'm going to be focusing on there is a wound right 
15 here on the middle part of his upper right arm. 
16 There is a wound right here.

A 
Number 23? 
This is Number 23. And this is a closer 
19 picture of the wound that I couldn't really show too 
20 well on the overhead projector, but this is the 
21 wound in question right here. So it is on the upper 
22 portion of his right arm, but it is on the inside 
23 portion of the arm, medial. 
24

7 This is Image Number 25, so the head 
8 of Mr. Michael Brown is here, the hand, the right 
9 hand is out here, this is the shoulder area and we 
10 are looking at the medial or kind of the inner 
11 aspect of the right arm, but what I'm focusing on 
12 right here there's another wound right here in the 
13 bicep region on the right arm. And then there is 
14 also a tattoo here on the forearm that reads Big 
15 Mike.

17 portion of the right arm. When I say the upper 
18 portion of the right arm, I'm talking from the elbow 
19 to the shoulder. So where your bicep would be and 
20 this is a different portion of the right arm, but 
21 there's a different identifying tattoo here.

3 A Image 31. So now we are looking, the 
4 shirt has been raised, we are still looking at the 
5 right sides of the body. So over here on the right 
6 lateral side of his chest, lateral is to the 
7 outside, you have a wound right here and that's the 
8 main thing that I'm focusing on at this point. 
9 So this would be 32. This is just a 
10 closer up view of that wound that I just showed you 
11 previously here on this lateral part of the right 
12 chest. And this is the nipple on right side. 
13 Q 33, it should be? 
14 A Image Number 33. The only thing different 
15 in this photo is, the ruler has been introduced per 
16 scale. Still looking at the same wound I just 
17 showed you. 
18 This will be Image Number 34. So 
19 here is Mr. Michael Brown's head, the shirt has been 
20 raised up further in this particular situation. 
21 That previous wound that I was just showing you was 
22 down here, there is a new wound here on the, kind of 
23 the upper part of right chest, and that's what I'm 
24 focused on right now, a different wound?

3 Q 36. 
4 A Image 36. The only difference is a ruler 
5 has been introduced per scale and there is also a 
6 wound out here, this is like an abrasion here on the 
7 right side of the chest. So there is two things of 
8 interest here and here. 
9 Image 37. We have switched over to 
10 Mr. Michael Brown's left arm and what, so his head 
11 is here, this is the left side of his body, this is 
12 the left arm and left hand that is still bagged with 
13 a brown paper bag. And there's an injury here on 
14 left forearm as well as there is a tattoo right next 
15 door. 
16 So this close-up image of the left 
17 forearm showing that injury that I just mentioned as 
18 well as the identifying tatoo. 
19 
20

Just for the record, that was Image 38. 
Image 39. Only thing different is the 
21 introduction of the ruler, still showing that injury 
22 on left forearm as well as the identifying tattoo. 
23 Now, 
24 you are classifying this as an injury rather than an 
25 wound, any significance to that?

2 This is Image 41, this is still left 
3 arm, the head is here, this is showing the dorsal, 
4 or the back side of the hand after the bag has been 
5 removed. 
6 This is 42. Now, I'm flipping back 
7 over to the other side of the body and this is going 
8 to be his right hand and the bag has been removed 
9 and here you can see an injury. 
Q I think 43? 10 
11 A Yes, 43. Image 43. This is the back side 
12 of the right hand and this is the, you know, the 
13 right forearm, right hand, this is after the bag has 
14 been removed from the hand. 
15 Image 44. This is just a closer view 
16 of the injury to the right hand and this is the 
17 ventral surface of the hand or the palmar surface of 
18 the hand. And that's the particular part that we 
19 are looking at. 
20 This is a close-up of the ventral or 
21 palmar surface of the hand. This is the right hand, 
22 this is the thumb and this is the particular area of 
23 interest, there is an injury. 
24 Image 46. Only thing different here 
25 is the introduction of a ruler. We are still

1 looking at the right hand looking at that surface 
2 where this injury is. 
3 This is 47. So in terms of getting a 
4 different take on the hand and the injury, the hand 
5 has been cleaned off at this point. So I have 
6 removed some of that blood and material that was 
7 stuck to the hand. So this is a cleaner image of 
8 the hand after the bag has been removed and after it 
9 has been kind of cleaned off and we are still 
10 looking at the palmar surface or ventral surface or 
11 front surface of the right hand. 
12 Before 
13 you washed the hand, you collect under his nails or 
14 whatever it is he has gunpowder or skin? 
15 A A good question. The question raised was, 
16 before I am starting to wash or clean the hand, do I 
17 do any type of forensics or other biological 
18 evidence from the hands, and I do. 
19 Once the bags are removed, they are 
20 documented with pictures and in this particular 
21 case, I did do scraping underneath the nails to get 
22 material which is then submitted for analysis. And 
23 I also took fingernail clippings from both hands, 
24 which is submitted for evidence. 
25 And the actual clipper that I

1 actually used to remove the finger nails, that is 
2 also submitted as evidence. So all of those things 
3 are done before the hand has been altered or washed. 
4 And then at that point once I have taken the 
5 fingernail clippings and the scrapings, then I go 
6 ahead and wash the hands and then continue my 
7 process. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the clippers that you 
9 used to clip the nails, those are one use clippers, 
10 they are sterile, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then regarding, let's talk about that 
13 injury to the right palm. We have seen in the 
14 photograph that you have washed it off so you can 
15 get a better look at the injury, correct? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, at some point you took, you cut a 
18 piece of that wound out; is that right? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
That is correct. 
But you haven't done that at this point? 
No, I have not. 
22 Q What do you wash the wound with? 
23 A Usually just water, warm water and a towel 
24 or a rag, or sometimes they have like kind of like a 
25 bristle type brush to be able to scrub off that

(By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. So now back to

15 A We are at 48 now. So this is still the 
16 right hand, the hand has been cleaned, it is just a 
17 closer view of that injury to the palmar surface of 
18 the right hand. 
19 This is Image 49. So only thing 
20 different, a ruler has been introduced for scale. 
21 So this is Image 50 and now we are 
22 back on the left side of the body. And this is the 
23 left hand and that's that wound or injury I was 
24 showing you guys earlier. I'm trying to focus on 
25 the thumb here, there is a little abrasion there.

1 Q Now, let me ask you, let me put this back 
2 up here. We see the position of the arm and the 
3 wrist and the hand is bent. 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Is that being held in that position or is 
6 that the way the body is fixed? 
7 A Most likely some of it is me putting a 
8 little bit of tension onto the hand to be able to 
9 better see the particular injury that I'm looking 
10 for, but at the same time there is also particular 
11 ways that the body, it is called rigor mortis, the 
12 body will be kind of fixed in a certain position. 
13 So there is mixtures of kind of these two events 
14 happening at the same time. 
15 The natural fixation or rigor mortis 
16 of the body, plus me putting tension on it to get a 
17 better look at the injury that I'm trying to show in 
18 this photograph. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. So the next photo is? 
This is Image 51. So this is a close-up 
21 of that left hand and it is just this little injury 
22 right here. Technically it is an abrasion, this is 
23 what I'm focusing on right here.

4 difference is the introduction of the ruler for 
5 scale. 
6 This is 53. So we are still looking 
7 at the left hand and I've, I'm starting to pull this 
8 fifth finger or the pinky finger on the left hand, 
9 I'm trying to expose a little area of discoloration 
10 on that hand. 
11 Showing you 54. So this is that 
12 fifth finger, that pinky finger on the left hand and 
13 this is this little area of discoloration, that's

1 from the body? 
2 A 
3 Q And is the clothing removed by cutting it 
4 off? 
5 A Urn, it depends, but in this situation it 
6 was just removed normally as you and I would take 
7 off our clothing. The only time the clothing is cut 
8 is if it is too difficult to remove it, but in this 
9 situation the clothing was not too difficult to 
10 remove, so it was not cut. 
11 Q Okay. And after the clothing is removed 
12 and that's seized and packaged by someone else, any 
13 items that were inside the clothing is taken care of 
14 by someone else, do you then clean up the body?

1 because your hands can move from one way or another 
2 anatomically, would it be correct that in an 
3 anatomical diagram the person would be standing 
4 upright and their palms would be forward? 
A That is correct. 5 
6 Q So if you are describing an injury on the 
7 palm, that would be a front injury to the front of 
8 the hand, anterior, ventral? 
9 A It is still ventral. The front would be 
10 anterior, it could be ventral, all of those are 
11 interchangeable terms or palmar, they are all the 
12 same, all the same thing. Just depicts the front 
13 portion of that body part in the standard anatomical 
14 position. And when I document the injury, it is 
15 always from this position. This is my reference 
16 point. (indicating) 
17 Q So when you're talking about, for example, 
18 an injury to the forearm, your forearms move when 
19 you turn your palms outward, correct? 
20 A Correct. 
21 Q So when you are talking about front or 
22 anterior, you have to imagine that this is a person 
23 whose palms is facing out. We might think this is 
24 the inside of our arm, he doesn't describe it that 
25 way. So for clarification, imagine that your arms

10 now? 
11 A This is Image 70. And the wound I will be 
12 talking about first will be Number 9. 
13 The next photo is going to be closer, 
14 but just to kind of let you know, so this is Number 
15 9 that we're looking at. Specifically I term this 
16 is medial ventral right forearm. 
17 So what that means is, I will stand 
18 up so you guys can see. So the normal anatomical 
19 position is like this. So when I'm saying medial, 
20 medial is in reference to, you know, draw an 
21 imaginary line down the middle of that particular 
22 extremity, medial is to the inside, lateral is going 
23 to be to the outside of that imaginary line. 
24 Ventral, as we have already discussed 
25 before, is talking about the front part of that

1 particular extremity or whatever we are looking at. 
2 It is also synonymous with anterior, front or 
3 whatnot. 
4 When I say medial ventral, or right 
5 forearm, so talking about something that is off the 
6 midline inside, which makes it medial. Ventral 
7 meaning it is on the front and depicting a 
8 particular area which is the right forearm. So 
9 that's the terminology. So, and we're talking about 
10 this wound right here. 
11 So this next image, which will be 71, 
12 showing a close-up of wound Number 9. 
13 So a lot of this is just jargon for 
14 me to be able to say where it actually is on the 
15 body in terms of reference points. So with all of 
16 my gunshot injuries, I like to have two reference 
17 points. 
18 One of them is a fixed point, so in 
19 this particular situation, I find something is going 
20 to be the right elbow and I'm going to say how far 
21 above or down it is to be able to specify, you know, 
22 the upper dimension or the lower dimension, which is 
23 kind of just your natural body axis. 
24 So in this particular situation this 
25 wound is 15 centimeters below this right elbow, and

1 then you want to be able to say where in the midline 
2 that is and that lets me know medial or lateral. 
3 So in this particular situation, this 
4 particular wound is 5 centimeters to the left of the 
5 anterior midline of the right forearm. 
6 So when I say left, it is from my 
7 left, not from you looking at me. 
Q From the body's left? 8 
9 A From the body's left. So this is the 
10 right side of my body, since I'm going to the left, 
11 I'm going over here, that's how it gets to where it 
12 is supposed to be. 
13 So from that point, what I want to do 
14 after that is, I measure all of the wounds in terms 
15 of dimensions to see how big it is. In this 
16 particular situation it is about 2 centimeters wide 
17 as it is long. So it is 20 millimeters by 20 
18 millimeters or 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters, 
19 whatever you want to use. It is the same changeable 
20 amount. 
21 Once you do that, you want to look at 
22 the edges of the wound, meaning why that is 
23 important, with exit wounds as well as entrance 
24 wounds, there is particular identifying 
25 characteristics that you can see on a case by case

1 basis. They are not always there, but there is 
2 certain things that kind of give me inside track to 
3 kind of figuring out what it is. 
4 So in this particular situation when 
5 I'm looking at the edge of this wound, it is more 
6 irregular, it is kind of like, you know, someone 
7 kind of took a bite out of it, it is not a nice 
8 smooth circle or oval, it is more irregular. These 
9 edges are kind of tattered and look different. 
10 So I specify how that looks to me. 
11 So in this particular situation I say that there's 
12 irregular edges, the wound is irregular and it is 
13 also clean, meaning that I don't see any type of 
14 injury to the actual edge of the wound. 
15 Exit wounds, classically, this is 
16 kind of how they look. So once all of that is done, 
17 I'm able to say at this point that this is an exit 
18 wound. 
19 So once I'm familiar with this as an 
20 exit wound, eventually I'm going to want to try to 
21 find out where the entrance wound is. 
22 So we know where we are on the arm, 
23 on the right arm, we are on the inside portion of 
24 the arm and we are off medially of that midline. So 
25 this is the exit wound of that right forearm.

2 discoloration right here at about 10:00 on that 
3 picture, what does that mean? 
4

6 
A 
Q 
A 
That's just blood, dried blood. 
Okay. 
When the blood coagulates, it darkens, 
7 that is what a clotted piece of blood looks like 
8 after it sits there too long, that is what that is. 
9 Q In your report when you describe these 
10 various wounds or injuries, you talk about there 
11 being no stippling and no soot present? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And you didn't find any stippling or soot 
14 on this wound, but why don't you explain to them 
15 what that is and what that means to you? 
16 A All right. So the concepts of stippling 
17 and soot. Stippling, so let's just take a step 
18 back. 
19 You have a bullet and it's fired out 
20 of a gun, a bullet is made up of like a primer, it 
21 is kind of the igniting substance that's within the 
22 actual bullet. And when that hammer of that gun 
23 strikes that primer, kind of combusts and kind of 
24 explodes, for lack of a better word, and then lights 
25 the gunpowder that's within the actual bullet. That

Page 106 
1 ends up being propelled and that's what allows the 
2 bullet to come out of the barrel of the gun. 
3 The concept with stippling is that 
4 when that primer ignites that gunpowder, in theory 
5 it all combust or burn, thus ultimately turning into 
6 soot, but when it doesn't turn into soot, you still 
7 have unburned particles that are real small, but due 
8 to the fact that they are being projected or shot 
9 out of that barrel of the gun, they are able to 
10 injure the skin. And those injuries of the skin is 
11 called stippling. So you will see little small 
12 individual dots around a wound. 
13 What is important about the stippling 
14 is it helps you with the range of where that weapon 
15 is fired from. 
16 So just roughly it depends on gun to 
17 gun, bullet to bullet, but roughly if you see 
18 stippling, you can say that that gun was fired a 
19 foot and a half to 3 feet to that particular part of 
20 the body. So that's what stippling is good for. 
21 Now soot is, what I just kind of 
22 briefly mentioned, is when that primer kind of 
23 combusts, then lights that gunpowder, that gunpowder 
24 thus combusts and then it turns into soot, that's 
25 going to come out of the gun as well. When that

Page 107 
1 comes out of the barrel of the gun that can be 
2 deposited on the skin. 
3 The concept of soot is when you see 
4 soot on the body, you are looking at something 
5 that's closer than a foot and a half. You start to 
6 look and say that particular bullet was probably 
7 fired within 6 to 9 inches, or 6 to 12 inches of the 
8 actual body. So that's the importance of mentioning 
9 do I see soot, do I see stippling, so I describe 
10 what they are, and I describe what the importance of 
11 them is. 
12 So at the end of the day, it is 
13 really helpful with range of where that particular 
14 projectile was fired from the gun. 
15 Q And in this case, you do describe in each 
16 wound whether there was present stippling or soot, 
17 but this being an exit wound Number 9, you wouldn't 
18 expect to see any soot or stippling knowing it is an 
19 exit wound, correct? 
20 A Correct, wouldn't expect to see that, so 
21 that's another thing to let you know that okay, this 
22 is most likely an exit wound. We don't see those 
23 features, you don't always have to see them. That 
24 is something that kind of puts you in that category 
25 we are not dealing with a close wound.

Is there 
2 any question ever at this particular point in the 
3 examination that those wounds were caused by a 
4 bullet or anything else? 
5 A Urn, for me for the amount that I've seen, 
6 I've seen enough that I myself know that it was a 
7 projectile, yeah. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You will describe in a 
9 minute the corresponding entrance wound, but 
10 sometimes it is probably just a layman's term, we 
11 call that a through and through where a projectile 
12 passes entirely through the body. Is that something 
13 you've seen in gunshot wounds?

15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. And knife wounds would look

Yes, that is correct. 
All right. So now have you described 
19 everything? 
20 A Yes, so we've described all of the 
21 important features for this particular wound. I'm 
22 convinced that this is an exit wound, so I know that 
23 there is an entrance wound somewhere else on the 
24 body, so that's my next step eventually when I get 
25 there.

Seven or Six? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is that an exit wound? 
This is Number 7. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And that's an exit wound? 
Yes, I'm about to describe it. So we're 
8 looking at Number 7. So the particular location is 
9 the upper dorsal right arm. 
10 So what we are talking about is, 
11 remember I was telling you about the forearm is 
12 going to be from the wrist to the elbow, the upper 
13 arm is going to be from the elbow to the shoulder. 
14 So upper arm, that's where we are at. And then when 
15 I say dorsal, and dorsal means the back part. 
16 So we are looking, you know, 
17 anatomically speaking, if you turn around like this, 
18 if you look back here, this is kind of where this 
19 wound is. It is here. So that's the dorsal part of 
20 the upper part of the right arm. And then that's 
21 where we are at right now in terms of position. 
22 Now, once you look at it, what is 
23 important is now I go through that same type of 
24 algorithm that I had before. You want to look at 
25 the contour of it, so this one is a little more

1 stretched out, more linear as opposed to that other 
2 wound, which is a little more irregular. Not really 
3 a big deal, but you still want to take the same type 
4 of approach in describing what you see. 
5 So this particular one, that's kind 
6 of the shape and it's length is 18 millimeters by 10 
7 milliliters. In terms of location, I do that again, 
8 two fixed points. When I say how far it is from the 
9 shoulder and say where it is from the midline, I've 
10 done that. 
11 Then you want to assess the edges, 
12 meaning assessing the edges is determining how they 
13 appear to you because that is going to be important 
14 to determine whether it is entrance or exit. 
15 In this particular situation, they 
16 are a little bit irregular, but there is no type of 
17 additional margin around it, it is still a clean 
18 wound. 
19 So when I say clean, there is no 
20 contusion, there is no abrasion around it, it is 
21 just coming, coming right back out the skin, making 
22 really no abnormalities to it. 
23 So with me seeing that, this once 
24 again let's me know that this is another exit wound, 
25 but on a different part of the body. I know that I

1 have an entrance wound someplace else. So this 
2 would be Number 7 where it is located. Do I have 
3 any questions about that? 
4 So what explains 
5 the elongated hole rather than a round hole? 
6 A A lot of times it is the actual tissue of 
7 where it is. So if you have an area where there is 
8 more fat on the arm, this particular area you can 
9 get a more elongated wound. 
10 You have different types of soft 
11 tissue make up there. So depending on where you get 
12 hit, you are going to see different types of 
13 orientation of the wound or contours of the wound. 
14 So that is kind of a more fatty area of the body, so 
15 it is going to stretch out a little bit more as 
16 opposed to a place that's tighter, where the skin is 
17 tighter, you are likely going to see a different 
18 type of wound and more irregular. 
19 If you feel your forearm yourself and 
20 you kind of tense it up, your forearm is lot tighter 
21 as oppose to the back side of your arm. 
22 This is Image 74. And this is the 
23 same exit wound and we're looking, only difference 
24 is we just introduced the ruler for scale.

1 at Wound Number 11 on the autopsy report. We are 
2 looking at the ventral surface of the right thumb, 
3 or near the ventral surface of the right thumb. So 
4 anatomical position like this. So we are looking at 
5 the front part, anterior part of the ventral part of 
6 the hand. We are looking at the right hand is where 
7 we are at right now. 
8 This is 76. There is a lot going on 
9 here and I will just try to do it step by step. 
10 Wound number, so this is 76, Wound Number 11. So we 
11 are looking at the ventral surface of the right 
12 thumb. 
13 So in terms of describing this one, 
14 this wound has looked a little bit different than 
15 the two that I just kind of showed you guys earlier. 
16 This one is more elongated, meaning it is more 
17 stretched out as opposed to being like a circle. 
18 When you look at it, what is 
19 important to realize is appreciating the elongating 
20 nature and then two, there's these little tags that 
21 you see, kind of like little sharks teeth. These 
22 tags are ultimately going to be important for 
23 determining the direction that you can say the 
24 bullet is coming out of the gun and how it struck 
25 his hand, but I will get to that part after I kind

2 The fact that I'm looking at this 
3 kind of elongated wound, I'm seeing this kind of 
4 shark teeth, call them skin tags. I know that this 
5 is like a graze wound or a tangential wound. 
6 Tangential just means that it is going parallel to 
7 the surface of whatever it is striking. 
8 So in this particular situation, got 
9 that, and then you want to measure it, which we've 
10 done. And the measurement is just five centimeters 
11 by two centimeters, and it is orientating kind of a 
12 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock fashion. It is 12 o'clock 
13 to 6 o'clock based off the anatomical position. So 
14 we are kind of going from down, or down to up or 
15 however you want to do it, it is no big deal. 
16 All right. What is important about 
17 these skin tags is how it lets you know what 
18 particular way the bullet is coming from. The skin 
19 tags point towards where the gun, the barrel of the 
20 gun is. 
21 I'll come up here and show you. If 
22 the gun, the barrel of the gun is pointed this way, 
23 this is the way that the bullet is going to be 
24 traveling. These skin tags point back towards the 
25 barrel of the gun. You can't refute it. It is what

1 it is. These tags are pointing back this way. They 
2 are pointing towards this. 
3 So I know for a fact that the bullet 
4 is coming this way. It is going like that. 
5 (indicating) 
6 Now, in terms of the anatomical 
7 position of the body, in order to keep both 
8 reference points the same, I'm still like this. So 
9 the reason that my trajectory is up is because it is 
10 just going up based on what the body is going 
11 towards the head because I'm like this. 
12 In real life did it go up? Can't 
13 really say that, but just having the anatomical 
14 position of how I have to stay static so that I can 
15 have a reference point every time that I can discuss 
16 these, you have got to keep yourself like this and 
17 my direction of upward is purely based off of being 
18 like this. I want you to make sure that you 
19 understand that. 
20 So what I know at this point is I 
21 have a tangential wound, I know which way it is 
22 going, I know which way it is coming from. 
23 Now other things that are important 
24 at this point with this wound, I can see it better

1 you have. You can kind of see, it is kind of dark 
2 here, kind of black, but here is it is a lot darker. 
3 Can I show? 
4 If you look at the hand, and I will 
5 kind of walk around. If you see that material in 
6 there, you can't really appreciate it too well on 
7 the screen, but that's something where we are 
8 talking about soot and talking about stippling, this 
9 is where this is coming into play. This isn't 
10 stippling, the stippling, I told you, is unburned 
11 particles that cause the little dots on the skin. 
12 This is soot, which is the burned gunpowder that's 
13 coming out of the barrel of the gun and it is being 
14 deposited on the skin discoloring it and leaving it 
15 there. So there is soot there on the hand. 
16 
17 
MS. WHIRLEY: So what does soot look like? 
So that means that it was 
18 a close range to the gun? This entered his body or 
19 grazed his body at a closer range to the gun than it 
20 would be if it was stippling or nothing at all?

13 So front 
14 of the body facing this way, it can also that it 
15 entered, can it be entered this way too? 
16 A Well, just how you did it, it has to be 
17 like that. If you are sitting there, I have to be 
18 above like that for it to come. That's the only way 
19 it can come, it can't come any other way, or if you 
20 are like this or you are like that or you are like 
21 this. There's lots of different ways regardless, it 
22 has to be coming at you that way, you can't get it

2 What 
3 again is the maximum distance you would expect to 
4 see soot? 
5 A Soot, it depends, it is a gun by gun 
6 basis. It is a primer, gunpowder thing, but about 6 
7 to 9 inches roughly where the discharge of that 
8 material would be left on the body. 
9 Is there a middle 
10 distance, like if his hand was on the end of the 
11 barrel, would you still see the soot, so it is up to 
12 that 6 to 9 inches? 
13 A You would still get some discharge of 
14 material if his hand was there, but the problem with 
15 that is, so when you say hand, you mean like? 
16 He was reaching out 
17 struggling for the gun? 
18 A You are like that, the wound is going to 
19 look different. Now we are dealing with a contact 
20 wound. If you are talking about actually physically 
21 holding something, that's something extra and 
22 different. 
23 And for myself, let me take a step 
24 back about the soot and stippling. Stippling, when 
25 I see it, that lets me know that I'm dealing with an

1 intermedia type of wound, meaning that it is like 
2 maybe like a foot and a half to 3 feet away. Then I 
3 have indeterminate wounds where I don't see 
4 stippling, don't see soot, I do know it's an 
5 entrance wound, so there is nothing extra on the 
6 wound to let me know about closeness. So in that 
7 situation, those are called indeterminate. They are 
8 probably 3 feet or further away, that's all I can 
9 say. 
10 Soot, like we just discussed, we're 
11 talking about 6 to 9 inches. Contact wound, if it 
12 is a contact wound, so we are talking about we are 
13 up close and personal to whatever it is. 
14 So with that you are going to see 
15 different type of characteristics on the scene, you 
16 are going to see more searing or burning of that 
17 skin because there is hot particles and gas escaping 
18 from that weapon that are going to cause alterations 
19 of that skin surface. 
20 And when you actually examine the 
21 wound, you may see that soot type material deposited 
22 deep into the tissue or be black and deeper on the 
23 inside than the outside, or you may see a muzzle 
24 imprint. A muzzle imprint is where the end of the 
25 gun actually is so close to the skin surface or body

1 surface where it leaves the end part of that barrel 
2 imprint on the hand. So those are some of the 
3 things you look for a contact wound. 
4 So closest thing you've got of a 
5 contact wound, next is a close range wound with the 
6 stippling, I'm sorry, soot. And then intermediate 
7 is where we are dealing with stippling, and then the 
8 last thing is indeterminate, too far away, you can't 
9 determine. That's kind of my range of wounds and 
10 what the actual terms of contact, close, 
11 intermediate and indeterminate mean. 
12 This is 
13 telling us that it was a closer range and that the 
14 hand was open, not around --
15 A All I can say it is a close range wound. 
16 For him to get that, he is within 6 to 9 inches of 
17 however scenario you want to create in your head, 
18 that's all that that means.

2 So as I said before, when I'm doing 
3 an autopsy, part of a complete autopsy examination 
4 is sometimes you have histology. Histology is the 
5 preparation of tissues that you take from the body, 
6 you process through some dehydration steps, alcohol 
7 step, you eventually put it into a block of paraffin 
8 wax. Where you then take microtone, which is just a 
9 blade and cut off a very thin silver of that tissue, 
10 put it on a glass slide and then using different 
11 type of dyes, pink dye, a blue dye, you are able to 
12 stain it. And then I get a slide back and then I 
13 put that under my microscope and then I can see the 
14 histology. That's just the study of tissues under a 
15 microscope. 
16 In this situation I took some small 
17 pieces of skin from those areas of discoloration and 
18 I did histology on them. I got those back, and I 
19 looked under there, under the microscope. And when 
20 I can see in my actual skin sample is, I see foreign 
21 particles of matter, and what that means is, there 
22 is some of them are pigmented, some of them have 
23 different colors, but there is material there that 
24 he wasn't born with that had to be introduced into 
25 his skin as foreign material. I know that much.

histology and from what I have seen in the past, the 
material that I'm seeing is consistent with products 
that are discharged from the barrel of a firearm. 
So that's why I can look at that 
picture on my eye, it looked concerning for some 
18 type of extracorporeal, meaning something that is 
19 coming from outside of the body. Some extra matter 
20 that I wanted to figure out what it was. 
21 It is not something that he woke up 
22 in the morning with or something like that, but 
23 taking those samples with my pictures as well as 
24 looking at the histology, was consistent with 
25 products that are discharged from the barrel of a

1 firearm. 
2 And lots of products come out of a 
3 firearm. You have primer material, you have metal 
4 fragments, gunpowder, soot, you get all kind of 
5 things. There is mixture of things that are in 
6 there, that are foreign. That's why I say it is 
7 consistent with products discharged from the barrel 
8 of a firearm, does that make sense? 
9 So did everybody get, I didn't get to 
10 specifically say the areas I'm concerned about, you 
11 can see the dark. 
12 I have one question, 
13 So that wound, the hand wound, so 
14 basically the projectile, there was no exit wound? 
15 A Exactly, it is just running along the skin 
16 surface. It is a graze wound.

1 that I'm going to talk about next. And specifically 
2 the region on the body is, it is the right bicep, 
3 which is here, the bicep is just the muscle that is 
4 in between your elbow and attached to your muscle 
5 here, the deltoid, which is your shoulder muscle, 
6 that's the area that we are talking about. We are 
7 talking about this wound right there. 
8 In particular this one too is similar 
9 to the other one that I just described, this is also 
10 a graze wound or a tangential wound, meaning that it 
11 is just running along the surface of the skin. 
12 Now, what is different about this one 
13 is, this is going to be Image 79. So I'll just 
14 describe it first and then we will get to the 
15 differences between the two. 
16 So this one is located 6 centimeters 
17 above the level of the right elbow, so it is a flat 
18 fixed point, so it is up above the elbow and then it 
19 is just to the left of the anterior midline. So it 
20 is more kind of medial than anything. It is going 
21 close to here as you saw in the picture. 
22 So the wound is measuring 3 
23 centimeters by 1 centimeters. In terms of how it is 
24 positioned, it is kind of going, you know, I guess 
25 you say this is 9 o'clock. So the face of the clock

1 is here, this would be 12, this would be 6, so it is 
2 going 9 to 3. So it is going in kind of a 
3 horizontal fashion. 
4 Now, this one, what's different is, 
5 the other one had nice skin tags, we could determine 
6 the directionality of the wound because it went deep 
7 enough and it also hit a part of the body where the 
8 skin on your hand is pretty tight. So it is more 
9 resilient to being disrupted. So it is going to 
10 pick up more changes of damage. 
11 With this particular situation, you 
12 don't see any of those skin tags and what you do see 
13 is a drying or an area of discoloration here on the 
14 outside of this particular wound. 
15 And when I palpated it, meaning 
16 touched it with my fingers, this wound was very hard 
17 and was very firm. 
18 So in this situation, this is not 
19 soot, this is not any gunpowder, this is just the 
20 drying of the edge of the wound where some blood 
21 starts to leak out around the edges and interactions 
22 with air and interaction with clotting, it turns 
23 dark. 
24 So this is just discoloration from 
25 dry blood, this is not soot or anything like that.

1 So in terms of determining distance on this one, I 
2 can't. In terms of trying to determine 
3 directionality, I cannot. This is something that 
4 came from greater that 3 feet away. I don't have 
5 any characteristic things of stippling or soot or 
6 searing or muzzle imprint to determine how close it 
7 is. So this thing is farther than 3 feet. I don't 
8 know exactly even which way it is coming, but I do 
9 on, you know, you do mention the directionality of 
10 it, the three, I can't even say. There is nothing 
11 to let me know which way it is coming from. So 
12 that's that wound and that is how it is different 
13 from the hand wound, but it is still a gunshot wound 
14 nonetheless, but a different type.

7 Miss Whirley, myself and the court reporter. Please 
8 continue. 
9 A So this is Image 81. On your paper, on 
10 the report where I have Wound Number 6, the I 
11 specific area of this injury is the upper ventral 
12 right arm. So what I'm talking about here is 
13 roughly, you know, kind of here in the area of the 
14 bicep. 
15 You have a gunshot wound here, so it 
16 is the upper part, meaning in between the elbow and 
17 the shoulder. The right arm, and then dealing with 
18 the ventral portion, which is the front part of the 
19 arm. So that's where this wound is. 
20 And as I said before, I go through 
21 the same process of documenting the size and the 
22 actual location on the body were two fixed points. 
23 So this one is 20 centimeters below the level of the 
24 right and 1 centimeter to the right of the anterior 
25 midline of the upper arm. This particular wound

1 measured about 10 millimeters by 10 millimeters, or 
2 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter. 
3 Now, what is different about this one 
4 and what I was showing you guys before is, I showed 
5 you one wound that was more irregular, some tissue 
6 was kind of coming out, there was a little piece of 
7 clotty blood, it was more elongated, it had clean 
8 exits. This one is more oval in shape. 
9 And what I can see here on the 
10 picture, which is demonstrated a lot better than 
11 here, but the difference between this one, first 
12 thing is oval in shape. You can make right here a 
13 little bit of pink tissue right here. You can make 
14 an argument is that an abrasion. A definition of an 
15 abrasion is just the superficial layers of your skin 
16 are rubbed off and it exposes the pink of the white 
17 meat of your hand and that's what an abrasion is. 
18 So when these bullets come in, they 
19 don't always go straight in, they can come in at 
20 different angles. So when it comes in and it starts 
21 to rub that tissue off, that's what an abrasion ring 
22 or an abrade is on a gunshot. 
23 If you see that, that's kind of 
24 indicative of an entrance wound. So in this 
25 particular situation you can make an argument is it

1 there or not. I said it wasn't really definitive, 
2 but you can see a little bit there. But around it, 
3 it is kind of like a little bit of a reddish hue and 
4 that's kind of like a contusion ring. 
5 So there is an injury to the skin 
6 from the outside going in. And so this part, when 
7 you see that, these kind of features together this 
8 lets me know this is an entrance wound. 
9 And then the flip side of the exit 
10 wound, the exit wound just pretty much it will stay 
11 the same color, brown color of the skin, you can see 
12 a little bit of purple around it, you can see a 
13 little bit of pink, but it is pretty much just the 
14 wound. That's the difference between the two and 
15 those are the little small differences that you are 
16 trying to look for to be able to appreciate when you 
17 are trying to separate out an entrance wound from an 
18 exit wound. So that being said, this is an entrance 
19 wound. 
20 Now at this point, what I do now is 
21 that, take a step back. 
22 With cases I can also do x-rays with 
23 gunshot wound cases where people are dying from 
24 wounds or gunshot wounds. You want to be able to 
25 x-ray the body to be able to one, determine where

1 there are projectiles, to also see any type of 
2 injures that may have fragmented the bullet, or to 
3 be able to help with the path of the bullet. Main 
4 thing is to see you still have evidence in the body. 
5 So the whole body in this case has to 
6 be x-rayed from head to toe. So this particular 
7 part of the arm that we're looking at has been 
8 x-rayed. So when you look here at what I'm talking 
9 about. Eventually I say, x-ray showed bullet 
10 fragments associated with that wound, that's what 
11 that means. 
12 So in terms of also looking at range 
13 in this case, I said that there is no stippling 
14 identified, there is no soot identified. So that 
15 lets you know that we're dealing with another one of 
16 these wounds that is at least 3 feet away or 
17 greater. I don't know, I can't tell. I just can't 
18 assess it because I don't have those distortional 
19 changes of soot, gunpowder or stippling. They are 
20 just not there, that's that part. 
21 Now, once that's done, you want to be 
22 able to say, okay, I've got the entrance wound now, 
23 I should have an exit. So this story now completes 
24 that exit wound that was up here by the, kind of the 
25 fat up in the armpit, that this entrance wound is

1 related to that exit wound. So once I know these 
2 two are related, now I have determined the path and 
3 the path is based off of what I told you all before 
4 is off of the anatomical position of the body. 
5 Now I know I have the in, got the 
6 out, then I can say what is trajectory of the body. 
7 So in this particular situation this 
8 bullet is going slightly upward, instead of 
9 backward, and it is going up, meaning that where it 
10 comes out at is a little higher than where it comes 
11 in at. That's the upward, upward talking from the 
12 feet to the head like this. So it is coming out a 
13 little bit higher than where it came in at, that's 
14 upward. 
15 Backward means this is the front part 
16 of the body, this is back part of the body. So if 
17 it is coming in here, going out there, you know it 
18 is going front to back, so it is backwards. 
19 In terms of the actual left to right, 
20 it is coming back a little bit this way on the body. 
21 So it is coming to my left and coming that way. So 
22 that's the trajectory of this bullet. A little up, 
23 a little to the left and it is going backwards 
24 that's the trajectory. It is based off of like this 
25 not, you know, jumping around, it is just like this.

1 Now, once that's done, you need to 
2 say the actual path in terms of the layers of the 
3 skin, soft tissue, everything in between you want to 
4 say what will it track through. So in this 
5 particular situation, underneath the arm of the 
6 skin, it went through soft tissue and then it came 
7 out of the skin on the back side on the right arm. 
8 So that's the actual path going 
9 through the body that it went. So soft tissue, so 
10 skin outside, soft tissue is everything like muscle, 
11 fibrous tissue, all of that stuff that is on the 
12 inside of your arm that is not bone, even blood 
13 vessels always needs to be considered soft tissue. 
14 So it went through there and came 
15 back out the skin, so it did not hit the bone. Hit 
16 everything else in between there except the bone. 
17 So that is what I mean by going skin, soft tissue, 
18 exit wound skin. 
19 So now we have one of those tracks 
20 kind of together. So we have the in and we have got 
21 the out, and that is what is going on right here. 
22 Questions? 
23 I have a

2 and exit describe the upper going through the back, 
3 I assume it does not necessarily give you any idea 
4 where the elevation of that weapon was? 
5 A Exactly. You have to think about it an 
6 arm, this arm can be in so many different type of 
7 ways. It is very difficult to be able to say 
8 exactly what elevation you are dealing with, that's 
9 why the arm is very difficult. 
10 The fact that you've got you have an 
11 elbow joint, you have a shoulder joint and then the 
12 wrist, you have a lot of mobility within that arm 
13 and it can be in a lot of different scenarios. It 
14 is very tough and even impossible for me to say. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And, Dr. not 
16 necessarily with this wound, but have you found in 
17 your experiences that often with projectiles that 
18 enter and pass through the body, it is not always 
19 necessarily a straight path, depending on if they 
20 hit bone or if they pass through other types of 
21 tissue, you can't necessarily say if it went 
22 straight through, that that was the angle that the 
23 bullet entered from and so forth? 
24 A And that's correct. You have to be 
25 cognizant of that fact that there are things that it

1 is hitting and going through that can alter the 
2 flight or trajectory of that bullet. 
3 This is 82. Same wound, only 
4 difference is there is a ruler for scale. 
5 This will be 83. We are looking at 
6 Number 8. Should be the dorsal right forearm. When 
7 I'm saying dorsal, anatomical position. This is the 
8 front of the forearm, and the forearm is between the 
9 wrist and the elbow. This is the front, dorsal is 
10 the back. So we are dealing with a wound here on 
11 the back side of the right forearm, and that's right 
12 here. 
13 And I've already talked about its 
14 associated exit wound which is here on the ventral 
15 part of the forearm, which is medial. Here is the 
16 entrance and here is the exit, I'm going to talk 
17 about the entrance now. 
18 So we are at Image 84. This is just 
19 a close-up view of this gunshot wound here on the 
20 dorsal part of the right forearm. 
21 So doing same thing again, always 
22 want to measure from a fixed point as well as 
23 imaginary line, it separates left to right, which is 
24 the medial from the lateral. 
25 So in this particular situation, it

1 is 16 centimeters below level of right elbow and 2.0 
2 centimeters of the posterior midline of right 
3 forearm. 
4 The hole itself was 11 centimeters by 
5 10 centimeters. So it is very similar in size to 
6 that last exit wound that I showed you that was part 
7 of the ventral arm. 
8 Looking at these edges, which is 
9 important to do every time. These look, the shape 
10 is kind of oval, but what you can start to see now, 
11 if you look at this little edge, there is a little 
12 bit of a rim of kind of red tissue right here to the 
13 outside, a little bit brown. This is kind of a good 
14 classical abrasion margin. So the abrasion margin 
15 is the thing I talked about before, kind of almost 
16 definitive, it lets you know this is an entrance 
17 wound, in the right situations. 
18 There is some other situations where 
19 you can see this, but it is not an entrance. I'm 
20 not going to confuse you with all of that right now. 
21 But this has the classical features 
22 of kind of being round to oval, having a nice 
23 abrasion collar right there on the outside, that's 
24 kind of critical and that's key. 
25 So when I see that, without getting a

1 probe, I also probe the wound with just kind of a 
2 little flexible rod to make sure my entrances and 
3 exits they are communicating together as they pass 
4 through the skin. 
5 Sometimes the rod won't pass through 
6 and I may have to open up the arm or whatever to see 
7 the actual wound track just to verify. Most times 
8 they will communicate and I probe these wounds to 
9 make sure that they are connected so they are not 
10 just a hole here and here. I'm just assuming they 
11 are together. I make sure I probe them, I make sure 
12 they are in communication whichever. This is the 
13 entrance wound here on the right dorsal forearm. 
14 So once that's being said, this 
15 particular body part, and in this situation when it 
16 is being x-rayed, there is little small metallic 
17 fragments that are showing up on an x-ray. And most 
18 likely these metallic fragments are fragmented 
19 bullet and the reason that it's fragmented is, is 
20 when this passes through the arm, it hits a bone in 
21 the forearm. 
22 You have two bones in your forearm, 
23 you have the radius and you have an ulnar. Your 
24 ulnar, if you feel your arm, you kind of feel the 
25 bone that is on the medial part of your arm, that's

1 your ulnar. The other part of the forearm out here, 
2 that's your radius. So it kind of makes sense that 
3 this exit wound that came out of that medial part of 
4 the ventral forearm, that it hit that bone. 
5 So when it came from out here, kind 
6 of where it is. When it passes through, went 
7 through those soft tissues, it hits that ulnar bone, 
8 shattered it and then that bullet came out. 
9 So going back to your question, why 
10 do exit wounds look different and look odd? So if 
11 you have a projectile that has now lost its normal 
12 shape and it is fragmented when it comes out of that 
13 skin, it is going to have a different shape as 
14 opposed to something that stayed intact. 
15 So that could be an additional reason 
16 for why you may see something elongated, some more 
17 irregular, you have to take into account the fact of 
18 what that bullet's actually doing when it strikes 
19 objects within an actual body. And a bone is a hard 
20 substance and it can be deflected some, so the 
21 actual trajectory is going to be, is going to be 
22 slightly upward, forward and left. 
23 So once again, it is going, this one 
24 in this situation is because the entrance wound is 
25 on the back side of the body, which the trajectory

1 is now forward because I'm like this, but it is 
2 coming from the back and going to the front, so that 
3 is why it is forward. That makes sense it is just 
4 purely based off of this position, not like this or 
5 anything like that, just like this. So it is coming 
6 back to front, and so that's the forward part. 
7 And in terms of the actual things 
8 that it hit, I have actually kind of said it a 
9 little bit, it is going through the skin, soft 
10 tissue, hitting that right ulnar and hitting the 
11 soft tissue again and coming out of the skin, an 
12 exit wound. So now we have another communication of 
13 a wound path. 
14 So we have entrance and exit right 
15 here on the back and the dorsal part to the ventral 
16 part, and we just talked about the one that's coming 
17 in here on the ventral part of the upper arm and 
18 coming out of the dorsal part of the arm, so got 
19 that both taken care of.

1 A A new wound here, 86. We are at Number 
2 4, the right front chest. We are specifically 
3 talking about this wound right here. 
4 Just to describe the image, you have 
5 Mr. Michael Brown's feet here, his head here, 
6 instead of laying on his back you can see another 
7 wound here and this is one of interest. You can see 
8 the entrance to the right side of his face. 
9 This should be 87. So this is a 
10 gunshot entrance wound to the upper right chest. 
11 And as usual, I always do two fixed points to 
12 determine where he's at on the body. So in this 
13 particular situation it is 16 centimeters below the 
14 level of the hole of your ear going down this way, 
15 and then it is to the right of the imaginary midline 
16 of the chest, so kind of right there. 
17 In terms of the actual dimensions of 
18 the actual wounds, it is 15 centimeters, 15 
19 millimeters by 10 millimeters. It is oval in shape, 
20 meaning it is pretty round. 
21 Now the edges, I always assess those 
22 to determine entrance or exit. When you look at 
23 this one, you can see a little bit on the edge, 
24 there is a little bit of a defect there, right there 
25 on the side, so that's the abrasion once again.

1 is most likely an entrance wound. At that point you 
2 want to be able to look for any additional injuries 
3 that need help with range. 
4 So there is no soot, meaning kind of 
5 that discoloration that you see around wounds and 
6 there is to no stippling, that would be those little 
7 small dots that you see around a wound, you don't 
8 have that. 
9 So once again, I'm looking at a wound 
10 where there is an indeterminate distance, is the 
11 body greater than 3 feet away. So that is all I can 
12 say. 
13 Once I know that, I move to the next 
14 part saying what's the, you know, looking at my 
15 x-rays to see if there is any fragmented bullets, 
16 any projectiles I need to get for evidence, that's 
17 the next point. 
18 So in this particular situation, when 
19 I did the x-rays, there actually was a bullet 
20 associated with this wound that I knew that I had to 
21 get on the inside of the body that I end up doing 
22 when I do my internal examination. 
23 So like when I told you all at the

1 the damages that happens to the organs, at that 
2 point I start looking for that bullet. 
3 So before anything even happens when 
4 I look at the x-rays before the case starts, I know 
5 I have a bullet there okay. 
6 Q If we can, go ahead and describe, I know, 
7 you know, they all know that you opened up the body 
8 and assess the injury to the various organs. Can 
9 you go ahead and talk about that in relation to this 
10 wound generally and then there will be later 
11 photographs and discussions about that? 
12 A All right. So when this one passed 
13 through, went through the skin and hit the collar 
14 bone right there and then went through, hit the 
15 upper portion of the right lung and then it went in 
16 between, so your rib cage, you have to think of it 
17 like a bare front part. Your ribs wrap all the way 
18 back to your spine. So when it passed through, your

23 
body is three dimensional looking from the side, 
comes in here, passed through that skin, soft 
tissuing, hitting that collar bone right there, 
hitting the upper portion of the lung and then 
burying itself in between the intercostal space

1 ribs total. Think of that as a ladder. So you have 
2 rib one, you've got rib two. In between rib one and 
3 rib two that's called the intercostal space. That 
4 is just the spot in between two ribs. So in between 
5 ribs three and four, that's where I got the bullet 
6 from this particular wound. 
7 So when this bullet went through the 
8 lung, it damaged the lung and created a defect. I 
9 think the defect is 2 centimeters in dimension. And 
10 then at the same time there was blood present within 
11 the thoracic cavity. The thoracic cavity are the 
12 chambers, you have two on both sides of your chest 
13 cavity. You've got a left side, you've got a right 
14 side. 
15 So within that right side, 
16 400 millimeters worth of blood, which is a decent 
17 amount filled up within that side of his body. So 
18 those are all the main kind of injuries associated 
19 with the path of this bullet going through, hitting 
20 that bone, hitting that lung and then burying itself 
21 in the back part of the thoracic cap area.

a while? 
15 The trajectory 
16 entered here is that it hit the collar bone, did the 
17 collar bone deflect it downward, you think, the path 
18 of the bullet? 
19 A It is possible, but it is hard to tell 
20 exactly what role that is going to play with the 
21 bullet. It is a wild card. You know, if it wasn't 
22 there, it went straight through the body, came out 
23 the back we all know, but the main thing you can say 
24 about it is, it is going to slow it down. It did 
25 fragment the bullet, it kind of broke it up a little

1 bit and it is going to slow it down, but that is 
2 about all you can really say. It is kind of an

It could be straight or down. 
Okay. 
You have to think about your head too, 
10 your head is on a pivot, so pivot, you know, like 
11 that. And say something is passing through it is 
12 possible it could do that or it could be a straight 
13 on shot. 
14 That's the variability that you have 
15 with wounds when you are dealing with something 
16 close to a joint or something, close where something 
17 can pivot around because you can get an exit from 
18 something from someplace else and reenter another 
19 place in the body. And that's what makes it 
20 difficult when you weren't actually there. 
21 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So I'm not saying this 
22 is true in this case, but you are saying you can 
23 have a bullet that would pass through someone's arm, 
24 so you have an entrance wound and exit wound of the 
25 upper arm, for example. And then the bullet can

3 Q And do you have any way to know whether 
4 that was the case in any of these wounds?

6 
A No, I do not. 
It was mentioned 
7 earlier, do you have any indication that the grazing 
8 from the hand could have been one of the chest 
9 entered wounds? 
10 A It is possible if your hand is in the 
11 right way for that to happen, it is possible. But 
12 all I can say about that wound is that, I have an 
13 idea of range and I have an idea of directionality, 
14 but that's really all that I can I definitely 
15 know from my examination, but after it left there, 
16 there is a lot of possibilities. 
17 This is 88. And the only difference 
18 with this one is the introduction of the ruler. 
19 A new wound here. This is going to 
20 be Number 5, lateral right chest. So as always, 
21 this is a gunshot entrance wound, it is located 
22 20 centimeters below the level of the right auditory 
23 meatus and then it is to the right of this imaginary 
24 midline of the chest. That is how you know where it

1 In terms of the size, it is 
2 12 millimeters by 12 millimeters, and this one kind 
3 of has a little kind of a teardrop or somewhat of a 
4 oval type shape to it. 
5 There is a very small abrasion ring 
6 around it and that is just that defect that you see 
7 associated with wounds and when bullets pass through 
8 the skin, it rubs off that little area as it is 
9 entering. So that is kind of letting me know that 
10 this is an entrance wound. 
11 As I always do, want to try to help 
12 yourself with range if you can. So I look for soot 
13 and I look for stippling. There isn't any on this 
14 wound, so now I'm dealing with another wound that is 
15 most likely greater than 3 feet away. I don't know 
16 how close, it is an indeterminate distance. 
17 Sox-rays are done, so there is a 
18 bullet associated with this wound as well. And it 
19 is further down in the body and I recovered it from 
20 the lateral part, which is kind of out here, of the 
21 right back. So it is kind of coming up here, but I 
22 end up getting the bullet out around down here, just 
23 so you know. 
24 So that kind of lets you know there 
25 is a downward trajectory with this particular wound

1 is just kind of being an artifactual thing, this is 
2 something on the outside of the skin, it is on the 
3 surface. A contusion or a bruise, that's blood 
4 underneath the skin surface. So it is like, you 
5 know, someone punches you, kind of turns blue, green 
6 whatever over time, you have blood underneath your 
7 skin that is going through the process of changing 
8 colors. 
9 So in this situation, this stuff 
10 that's here, this is just some artifact and just 
11 kind of cleaning off the wound and it is blood that 
12 kind of transfers from here out to the skin so that 
13 is not a contusion. 
14 Okay. Now, so we got the trajectory, 
15 you know, in turn, what did this pass through. It 
16 went through the skin, it went through the soft 
17 tissue, and as it is going down, you have got to 
18 once to think about your rib cage, kind of like a 
19 barrel. 
20 When it goes down through that skin, 
21 you have ribs kind of jetting out there, it kept 
22 going down and that rib, that eighth rib, you have 
23 12, it is kind of sticking out and the bullet hit 
24 that. It fractured that rib and it kind of bounced 
25 off a little bit and just stayed in the soft tissue.

1 The problem with that injury is, when 
2 that rib fractured, it fractured to the inside and 
3 the lung, the bottom portion of the right lung he 
4 had got punctured because of the breaking of the 
5 bone. 
6 So there is an additional injury to 
7 the lung further down. You have got one at the top 
8 too, one in the upper chest, now you have one 
9 further down. So there is a puncture wound from a 
10 bone breaking from a bullet hitting it, and you have 
11 got one that's just a gunshot wound that is actually 
12 hitting the lung. 
13 So there is going to be a little bit 
14 of blood coming out of that wound as well. So these 
15 two gunshot wounds technically of the chest, that 
16 400 millimeters of blood is going to be associated 
17 with both of those wounds. And so it is important 
18 to know that those can be ruled the same, they are 
19 both causing injuries to the body that if not 
20 corrected, it could end someone's life, but in this 
21 situation there is another wound to the head that 
22 I'm going to talk about. I just want to make sure 
23 that you understand the separation of the two. 
24 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So, Dr. this 
25 wound then, without medical care could be fatal, but

1 not immediately so? 
A Exactly. 2 
3 Q And again, with this type of wound, a 
4 person sustaining that would they be able to stand 
5 and be mobile for a while? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 There is nothing 
9 else sequencing of these events, correct? 
10 A For this wound here, no. 
11 Fatally, you know what the 
12 final one was, you don't really know --
13 A Right. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So far, just to be 
15 clear, and we don't, you can't say so far the 
16 sequence of these wounds? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Not right now, no. 
Which one happened first, but none of 
19 these wounds would immediately incapacitate someone? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
Okay. 
So this is the same wound that we are 
23 looking at. The only thing different is the 
24 introduction of the ruler. I'm sorry, I didn't say 
25 a number. This is 90, I'm sorry.

91. So the head of Mr. Michael 
2 Brown, we are looking at the right side of the face. 
3 And the wound that I'm going to be getting to next 
4 is going to be Number 3. It is going to be right 
5 here, it is going to be an exit wound of the right 
6 jaw. 
7 This is just showing from the top 
8 down, just showing some more wounds of the face. 
9 This is 93. So this is his neck, 
10 this is the top part of his head here and you have 
11 this exit wound here of his right jaw. So let's 
12 walk through this one. 
13 So this one is located about 
14 5.5 centimeters below the level of the right ear 
15 hole and then it is to the right of the anterior of 
16 midline of the head, which is like that. So it is 
17 to the right. The hole measures 15 millimeters by 9 
18 millimeters. 
19 Now looking at the contours of it, 
20 the contours meaning the edges, I do that on every 
21 wound that I see, the gunshot wounds. If you look 
22 at this one, you kind of see this little edge is 
23 kind of flapping over a little bit. You don't see 
24 those good little peak margins that are around it, 
25 it is a little more irregular, it is not as smooth.

1 And you kind of actually see a little bit of tissue 
2 kind of streaming out there and a little bit 
3 flopping out of the wound to the outside. 
4 So when I look at all of the 
5 constellation of all of these things, this is 
6 letting me know this is consistent with an exit 
7 wound. 
8 I don't see any stippling, I don't 
9 see any soot, shouldn't see that in an exit wound, 
10 but the thing is it is a little more irregular, 
11 don't see a good abrasion ring, don't see a good 
12 contusion, don't see any bruising, don't see 
13 anything that I typically see in a situation of an 
14 entrance wound, so I know that's an exit wound. 
15 This is going to be in relationship 
16 to another wound that I will get to eventually. 
17 So this is 94. And the only thing 
18 different about this is the introduction of the 
19 ruler. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
This is 95? 
This is 95. This is the right side of 
22 Mr. Michael Brown's face. I am wanting you to focus 
23 on this wound right here, which is a gunshot 
24 entrance wound. This stuff here, these are 
25 abrasions. I'll just describe them.

1 So up here on the right forehead, 
2 this kind of irregular area right here. This is an 
3 abrasion, as I said before, an abrasion is just 
4 where that superficial layer of the skin rubbed off 
5 and exposes that underlying soft tissue. That 
6 particular abrasion right there measures about 
7 7 centimeters at its greatest dimension, kind of the 
8 longest point. 
9 Then there is one over here on the 
10 lateral part of his face, it is kind of dried, 
11 meaning when I say dried, see how it is kind of 
12 discolored, this is more pink, this is dried. 
13 That's an abrasion right there on the right side of 
14 the face. 
15 And then let's see. And then over 
16 here, you will see it later, out there on the lip he 
17 has got some abrasions here on the inside of this 
18 lip. 
19 But back to the gunshot wound which 
20 is going to be the main thing I'm going to talk 
21 about next and that's going to be number two on your 
22 autopsy report. 
23 This is 96. Only thing different 
24 about this photo than the last one is just the 
25 introduction of the scale with the ruler.

1 This is 97. So this is this gunshot 
2 entrance wound of the central forehead. So it is 
3 located 7 centimeters above the right ear hole and 2 
4 centimeters to the right of the anterior midline of 
5 the head. So the imaginary midline of the head is 
6 here, it is 2 centimeters off to the side. So that 
7 just kind of locates the wound. 
8 The whole measures 15 millimeters by 
9 10 millimeters. The wound itself is somewhat oval, 
10 I can see better on the photo here, but right there, 
11 there is kind of an abrasion ring out here on the 
12 outside. 
13 What that is kind of helpful with is, 
14 it is kind of letting me know that it is going 
15 downward because when this, when this bullet came 
16 in, the abrasion ring is more irregular to this 
17 side, it is bigger on this side than it is there. 
18 So when it is rubbing in, I know that it is coming 
19 in a downward fashion. One, just because of the 
20 abrasion ring and two, because of where it 
21 ultimately went on his face. 
22 So it is coming here, think of the 
23 anatomical. It is here and when it is coming down 
24 passing there and it is going to come out of the 
25 face. So that you've got two reasons for how you

1 know it is down. The abrasion collar and also just 
2 the starting here and ending up there. It is coming 
3 from the top to here. 
4 Q And, Dr. did you determine that 
5 path not only, I mean, possibly via x-rays, but did 
6 you probe that wound as well? 
7 A Yes, I probe all of my wounds to make sure 
8 that the entrances and the exits do coordinate. 
9 Does your 
10 assumption in talking about how body parts move 
11 that, or like when his head was down, and the 
12 officer was standing above him. 
13 
14 
15 
A 
A 
That's a possible scenario. 
Thank you. 
So we got that. So now we dealt with the 
16 abrasion collar, we know there is an entrance wound. 
17 So now you want to look at your x-rays to see if you 
18 see any type of bullets associated with this. There 
19 are little tiny fragments, but no large intact 
20 bullets, I can't recover those. Those are not good 
21 for ballistics, you need kind of an intact chunk to 
22 be good for ballistics. 
23 All right. So in terms of soot or 
24 any type of stippling, there is nothing around it, 
25 only thing that is nearby are these abrasions.

1 So in terms of trajectory, how far 
2 away, I can't determine this, this is an another 
3 indeterminate wound that is going to be greater than 
4 3 feet away. 
5 In terms of the actual trajectory 
6 itself, it is downward, slightly backward and going 
7 to the right. It is going down, going back, meaning 
8 this is the front part of the head, it is coming 
9 back over here, so it is backward down and going to 
10 the right because this is the center, this is right 
11 side and it is going that way. 
12 All right. Now in terms of the 
13 actual tissue planes that it passes through, it is 
14 going from the skin, it's going through the soft 
15 tissue and the things that is interesting about this 
16 one is, so when it is passing through, there is 
17 like, there is defect here, call it a laceration, 
18 call it a defect. 
19 In my particular situation, I called 
20 it gunshot related defect because as this bullet 
21 passed through, there is enough meat and skin here 
22 on the front of Mr. Michael Brown's forehead that 
23 this bullet is tunneling underneath that skin. When 
24 it got right here where the eyebrow was resting over 
25 that ridge of bone that we all kind of have right

1 there, it disrupted that tissue, continued to travel 
2 underneath and then went by his eye here. There is 
3 another defect, it passed through the actual globe 
4 of the eye. 
5 Then you have a bone here, right 
6 underneath your eye, it went through that bone, 
7 passes through there, you have a bunch of soft 
8 tissue here in your jaw and cheek, it passes through 
9 there and then eventually comes out of the jaw right 
10 here on the side. So that's the particular path of 
11 this particular shot. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, does this 
13 projectile travel through any portion of the brain? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No, it does not. 
And now I know you said it went through 
16 some bone that was below the eye, does it fracture 
17 the bone at the entrance site? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No, it does not. 
So it goes into the skin and the soft 
20 tissue and then almost travels along the bone, along 
21 the, just underneath the skin?

1 that particular part of your body came in contact 
2 with another force. So to get an abrasion, I fell 
3 right now, I hit my head right there, I could scrape 
4 off skin. I fell down on the ground and collapsed 
5 on the ground that could cause those abrasions. 
6 From the way he's positioned where 
7 he's found after he's rendered disabled, his face is 
8 in contact with the ground and that's consistent 
9 with that position. 
10 There need to be forward 
11 motion on that face to scrape it like that.

You would need some sliding. 
Some sliding 
For it to rub off. You need a frictional 
15 force. You can't just plop straight down, plop 
16 straight down and cause more bleeding, you get more 
17 contusions from things just stopping and don't 
18 slide. When things slide with friction, that's when 
19 it gets rubbed off, and that's when you get your 
20 frictions. 
21 I don't 
22 recall, or not speaking about the abrasions, did you 
23 find any evidence of any type of burn to the skin or 
24 anything, any type of injury like that because we 
25 all know, I mean, this happened at 12:00, and the

1 young man laid there on the ground in one of the 
2 hottest days of the year. Any type of wounds such 
3 as that, any evidence of anything of that nature? 
4 A There's really no burning per se, but 
5 there is one wound on the cheek that had a dry 
6 appearance, that's about the only thing that, you 
7 know, contact could be a drying affect or something 
8 where the pavement is warmer, who knows, but that

11 Are the 
12 abrasions severe enough that you think the victim

1 at the top of Mr. Michael Brown's head. This is the 
2 top portion of his scalp. So what is happening here 
3 when he originally came in, I documented the body 
4 how it is, I shaved the hair off of his head to 
5 expose the wound, so this is what I created when he 
6 came in. He didn't look like this was all black 
7 hair here, you couldn't even see the wound. The 
8 reason why I knew it was there is from my x-rays, as 
9 well from palpating the head, I could feel a wound 
10 and I saw blood coming from there, that's why I knew 
11 there was something there. 
12 Once I identify a wound like that on 
13 the head, it is standard protocol and procedure for 
14 me to remove the scalp, not the scalp, the hair in 
15 order to one, be able to assess the collar, the 
16 abrasion collar, to help with distance and to also 
17 look for any type of stippling or soot. 
18 Kind of, you know, in a classical 
19 sense, typically the hair can block these things 
20 from being deposited on the skin, but proper 
21 protocol to be able to wipe away that hair to see if 
22 you can see anything that may have penetrated the 
23 hair and got to the skin to be able to help with the 
24 range.

1 remove the hair to be able to assess wounds to help

3 characterize the nature of the wound. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You know that brings up 
5 a question regarding the deposit of the soot or 
6 stippling. If the projectile enters through a piece 
7 of clothing, could that also affect whether or not 
soot or stippling is deposited on the skin? 
A That is correct. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
Q And in this case, the clothing was removed 
off of the body, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
13 Q And do you recall having a short sleeve 
14 shirt on, correct? 
15 A Correct. 
16 Q Now, did you examine the clothing yourself 
17 to determine if there were any holes in the 
18 clothing? 
19 A I do look at the clothing to look for 
20 defects and that's what I refer to them as.

Did you see any defects in the shirt? 
Yes, I saw defects in the shirt.

1 are. I generalize and say there are defects present 
2 in the shirt. 
3 Q Okay, all right. Thank you. 
4 A All right. So this particular one I think 
5 is probably Number 1. We are going to be looking at 
6 Wound Number 1 on the autopsy report. This is the 
7 gunshot entrance wound to the vertex of the scalp. 
8 So positioning as I always do, it is 
9 20 centimeters above the level of the ear, we are 
10 also going up from here. And it's, and it's near 
11 the actual midline of the head. So if you look, it 
12 is pretty much in the center, kind of dead on. 
13 The hole measures 10 millimeters by 
14 8 millimeters. It's roughly round and it has pretty 
15 level edges. 
16 Now, when you look at the edges as I 
17 always do, you can kind of see this little bit of 
18 pink tissue around there, that's that abrasion 
19 collar that is going to let you know theoretically 
20 this is an entrance wound. 
21 Now I have to caveat with gunshot 
22 entrance wounds to the head. You should never just 
23 purely go by the classical thing that we talked 
24 about, abrasion rings and contusions. The problem 
25 with it is the head is a skull that's underneath and

2 for the bullet to pass through. 
3 The best way to determine if there is 
4 an entrance or an exit wound of the skull is on my 
5 examination, when I reflect the scalp, which is a 
6 normal part of the procedure and remove the skull 
7 cap. When you look at the actual hole, and I think 
8 there will be some pictures eventually, we'll get to 
9 that. 
10 When you actually look at the hole, 
11 there is a concept called beveling. Beveling is 
12 where you will see an outpouching of the bone. So 
13 if the outpouching of the bone is to the inner table 
14 of the gunshot wound, that's an entrance wound. If 
15 the beveling or outpouching is on the outside of the 
16 outer table of the skull, that's called external 
17 beveling, that's an exit wound. 
18 So when I get to it, this particular 
19 wound had internal beveling, so that lets me know 
20 for sure that this is an entrance wound to the head. 
21 It is pretty much every time, I just want to make 
22 sure you understand that.

1 his head? 
2 A The shot fired has to be above the head. 
3 So in theory, if I'm sitting here and somebody's up 
4 there and shoots down, you have to be above, the 
5 shot has to be fired above his head in order for 
6 that to happen. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Kathi Alizadeh. When 
8 you say above, you're talking the anatomical 
9 diagram? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I'm just theorizing here, just theorizing. 
12 So if someone in this position, in other words, is 
13 bent over at the waist and the top of my head is 
14 facing the wall, that could account for a bullet 
15 that would enter the top of the head, correct? 
16 A That is correct. 
17 Q In this case you have no way of knowing 
18 where, what position his body was in when he 
19 sustained that gunshot wound? 
20 
21 
A No, I do not know specifically, correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: But it would be 
22 inconceivable for him to be standing at 6'4", 
23 straight up and have that shot to the top of his 
24 head from someone not as tall as him, taller than 
25 him?

3 A So as we always do, we want to see if 
4 there is any stippling or soot. That's not soot, 
5 that's just his hair. That wasn't scraped all the 
6 way off with a scapple. There is no soot, there is 
7 no stippling. So in terms of range, that is a wound 
8 that is greater than 3 feet away again. 
9 An x-ray, full body x-ray on this 
10 particular situation, there is a bullet associated 
11 with this wound that I ultimately recovered within 
12 the soft tissue on the right side of his face that's 
13 associated with this wound, there is a projectile. 
14 All right. There is internal 
15 beveling of this bone of the skull, which I was 
16 telling you about before, that lets me know that 
17 this is an entrance wound. 
18 The path or trajectory on this one 
19 based on the anatomical position is going downward, 
20 it is going from the top of the head towards the 
21 feet and it is going right. Meaning that when it 
22 passes through the head and goes through the brain, 
23 you got your outer part of your skull here, it is 
24 going that way and burying itself. You can see it 
25 is down and to the right. So that is how you know

Grand Jury

2 In terms of the actual tissue that it 
3 is passing through, going through the scalp, the 
4 skin surface of the head, soft tissue, the parietal 
5 bone of your skull, that's the particular location 
6 of the skull cap specific for me, but just layman's 
7 term, just your skull. 
8 Once it went through the skull, it 
9 hit the brain and your brain is separated in 
10 hemispheres. So you have a parietal bone, you have 
11 a parietal lobe. So it went through the parietal 
12 lobe of the brain, then it went through the temporal 
13 lobe of the brain. This is all on the right side. 
14 Then it passed through the right 
15 temporal bone of the skull, which is out here and 
16 punched through there and buried itself right here 
17 in the skin, the soft tissue beneath the skin on the 
18 right side of his head. So that's the path of the 
19 bullet. 
20 So when it goes through there, it is 
21 going to create injuries to the brain. There are 
22 small little tears or contusions that are happening 
23 to the brain as this bullet is punching its way 
24 through the white matter of the brain. You have 
25 gray matter on the outside and white matter on the

Grand Jury 
September 9, 2014 
Page 169 
2 The white matter is responsible for 
3 your, the nervous impulses that are going to go 
4 through your brain. So those tracks, there is 
5 little small contusions there, that's just from the 
6 pathway of the bullet going through the brain. 
7 There is also hemorrhage associated 
8 with the wound. You have multiple spaces in your 
9 brain. You have an epidural space, which is, you 
10 know, you have your skull, beneath your skull 
11 there's a space and then you have your dura. Your 
12 dura is kind of like, for lack better of a better 
13 word, the skin of the brain. In between that 
14 imaginary space is called the dural space, there's a 
15 space there. 
16 You can get the dural, then you start 
17 getting to another space and then you get to the 
18 brain. So beneath that dural space is the subdural 
19 space. 
20 There is blood there and there is 
21 actual blood on the surface of the brain, which is 
22 the subarachnoid space. There is two areas where 
23 there is blood, you have defects of where the bullet 
24 is entering and then kind of exiting out on the 
25 brain and staying in the soft tissue.

15 Q And just so I'm clear on this, the bullet 
16 that we're talking about is Wound Number 1 in your 
17 report, entered the brain, traveled through the 
18 brain and then you said was in the temporal region 
19 just beneath the skin or the soft tissue? 
20 A It is a little bit, it is coming right 
21 through the bone of the skull, it is sitting in the 
22 soft tissue right there.

3 So we do a red top and gray top for 
4 toxicology, and the specific blood that I used was 
5 chest cavity fluid that was sitting from that

7 used that for my toxicology because the other 
8 locations to try to get blood was very difficult. 
9 He had lost blood, it is difficult to get sometimes, 
10 so you get it where you can get it from. The 
11 biggest reservoir of blood was the chest cavity.

18 been mobile? 
19 A He could have been mobile, I wouldn't 
20 necessarily say survive. Those chest wound 
21 injuries, those would have eventually become fatal 
22 if not addressed. 
23 He would have been 
24 mobile, but this one absolutely?

1 Those 
2 thorax wounds if treated, he could survive that? 
3 A Unlikely, the chest wound. The problem 
4 with chest wounds, this is going to be the 
5 physiological problem with it. You need your lungs 
6 to breathe. When those bullets went into his lung, 
7 it punctured it, it squeezed it down, so now he is 
8 only working on one lung. At the same time what 
9 happens is there is vessels in there that he 
10 injured. 
11 So as that chest cavity fills up with 
12 blood, it is going to get to the point where it 
13 fills up with so much that it shifts all of those 
14 organs on the inside of your body to the other side. 
15 And the problem with organ shifting is you have a 
16 major organ in the middle of your chest, which is 
17 your heart. 
18 So think of it kind of like a garden 
19 hose. You put too much pressure on one end of it, 
20 it stops the flow of the water. So the stop of the 
21 flow of the water, in this situation is the blood. 
22 When that thing starts filling up and pushing over 
23 to the side, those vessels get squished, squished 
24 and eventually get squeezed off to where now the 
25 blood can no longer get returned to the heart to get

1 pump to other areas. And then that's the main 
2 problem is your head is not getting blood, now you 
3 are going to become unconscious. You are going to 
4 have two problems, you're not getting blood, your 
5 blood carries your oxygen. So you are not getting 
6 any oxygen to the brain, you are physically not 
7 getting blood to the brain, you are also losing 
8 blood out of your body, inside of your body. So you 
9 kind of got a lot of problems there.

Q 
I agree. 
Like if he were shot in the hospital, then 
19 possibly if there was a doctor at his elbow, 
20 possibly he could have medically then have survived

2 Q And just to clarify because you talked 
3 about bullets passing through his lung. And I 
4 thought maybe I misunderstood. I thought one of the 
5 injuries to the lung was caused by the rib that 
6 punctured the lung? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q Was there more than one bullet know 
9 through the lung? 
10 A One bullet went through the lung, the 
11 other bullet struck the rib, the eighth rib, which 
12 is nearby, so your right lung is in three pieces. 
13 It has got an upper lobe, it's got a middle lobe and 
14 it's got a lower lobe. So the first, that bullet 
15 that's up here by the clavicle by the collar bone, 
16 that hit the upper part of the lung. 
17 So when that other bullet passes 
18 through and hits the eighth rib, it snapped it, it 
19 fracture it. So say this is a rib cage, your lung 
20 is sitting there, when it broke it, it snapped it to 
21 the inside and when it broke, the bone punctured 
22 that lower portion of the rib causing additional 
23 injuries to the lung. So the bullet itself didn't 
24 do it, but the bullet hit the bone and snapped and 
25 did puncture the wound.

10 consciously chose to stop moving, you still would 
11 have the ability to move with sustaining a shot like 
12 that. It is not going to render you unconscious, 
13 that's the point I'm trying to make. The wound to 
14 the head, he's going to be unconscious, he can't 
15 move if he wants to. 
16 But you get hit here in the chest, 
17 you are going to have some time to be able to move 
18 around and it is depending on a variety of factors. 
19 How quickly you use blood. The main thing that will 
20 make you collapse is, once you block off that blood 
21 return, you've got maybe like 10 to 15 seconds of 
22 reserve of oxygen going to your brain before you 
23 pass out. 
24 So when you reach that critical 
25 level, each person is going to have a different

1 critical level with body masses, being different 
2 sizes, people have different kind of levels of blood 
3 reserve, different levels of volume. 
4 So someone smaller or bigger maybe 
5 last a little bit longer. Also the activity that 
6 you are doing before is also going to impact. Say, 
7 for instance, if you have been running and your 
8 heart was going really, really fast, you're going to 
9 pump blood out quicker as oppose to someone really 
10 calm, just kind of sitting there, you are not going 
11 to bleed as fast. So all of these factors play a 
12 role in determining how quickly you are going to be 
13 responsive or immobile. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. Let's go ahead 
15 and somewhat quickly if you can run through those 
16 other photos. If you go ahead and identify them and 
17 put them on what it says, what it shows abrasion? 
18 A This is 102, I believe. So this is his 
19 left arm, this is just showing a linear abrasion on 
20 the left arm. 
21 Q You characterize that before as being like 
22 a grazing wound? 
23 A I wouldn't say it is in that category. 
24 This one is some type of blunt force injury caused 
25 that. I wouldn't say it is necessarily a

1 projectile. The characteristic of it is different. 
2 You could have rubbed on something, it is hard to 
3 say. It is nonspecific, but it is not a classical 
4 graze wound like you saw on the bicep on the right 
5 arm or that graze wound. 
6 This is different. This is just an 
7 abrasion. It is not specific and I can't say what 
8 it is from. 
9 My thought was 
10 whether with glasses on, if you were able to tell if 
11 it was a clean cut? 
12 A That's something you can argue about, but 
13 the fact that it is so dry and, you know, it is kind 
14 of firm, it is kind of difficult to say is it a cut 
15 or incise wound. I can definitely say that is a 
16 superficial layer of skin has been rubbed off, but 
17 it is difficult to say was it a sharp or was it, you 
18 know, rubbing on some keys or who knows, a door, I 
19 don't know. It is kind of in between and it is 
20 difficult to specifically say what caused that. But 
21 there is definitely an injury there, the top part of 
22 the skin is gone. 
23 Thank you.

1 been choked? 
2 A Well, I would like to clarify for me. 
3 Strangulation is a better term, choking is 
4 different. 
5 Q Choking is like I got something, I 
6 swallowed something wrong or whatever? 
7 A Right, right. 
8 Q So you are right, so you've seen someone 
9 who has been strangled? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
What kind of injury would you see on 
12 someone who has been strangled? 
13 A Externally you may see abrasions from, you 
14 know, people have nails or whatnot and the rough 
15 nature of the event, you can create abrasions on the 
16 outside of the neck. You don't always see them, but 
17 you can. 
18 Then once you open the neck, when I 
19 do a dissection of the neck, you have multiple 
20 layers of soft tissue as well as muscle. 
21 If enough force is applied there, you 
22 can see hemorrhaging within the soft tissues of the 
23 neck and then also you have a bunch of structure 
24 within your neck called the hyoid bone can be 
25 fracture or injured. And in a strangulation, those

1 are some of the things I look for in the neck and 
2 situations where someone has been strangled or has 
3 an injury to the neck. 
4 Q In this case you found no injuries to his 
5 neck, correct? 
6 A Correct, correct. 
7 Q And I know when we are talking, when I say 
8 strangulation, I think of that as being like someone 
9 who is a cause of death, they are dead from 
10 strangulation, but people can be strangled, but then 
11 survive, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
13 Q And in some occasions, will you notice 
14 bruising to the neck? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then, obviously, you're not going to

9 there is a question or certain circumstance for it 
10 to happen. It is not part of routine procedure, I 
11 guess that's what I'm trying to say.

20 that disc are after the autopsy is completed and

5 they are part of the exhibit and they are something 
6 that you can examine at a later time. And if at 
7 all, there is a question later on down the road, 
8 specifically about something, that I didn't have him 
9 actually testify about, we will bring him back and 
10 have him testify again. Yes. 
11 The 
12 photographs that we are talking about, they are from 
13 the same string timeframe and same situation that 
14 we've seen up to this point, correct?

16 photographs that are taken by a police officer 
17 during the autopsy and so, for example, 
18 Dr. when you are retrieving a projectile, 
19 you have to cut into the body. In this case you 
20 did, and that is actually photographed that you have 
21 cut into the body and in some of these photographs

1 when Michael Brown is close enough to the officer 
2 for that to have happened. So depending on the 
3 circumstances that you guys hear from what I know, 
4 there is a point in time where they are in close 
5 approximation to each other at the vehicle. 
6 In my opinion I feel that's the 
7 closest they are for it to happen from the 
8 circumstances that I know that that injury occurred. 
9 So that has to be early on in the event. In terms 
10 of the end of the event, the wound to the top of the 
11 head is going to be the last wound that he is going 
12 to receive. 
13 So in terms of the beginning part 
14 with the thumb wound and the part at the end, those 
15 two I can feel good about saying that I know when 
16 those happened, but the ones in between, it is to 
17 difficult to say. 
18 Q And given the entrance and exits of the 
19 wounds that you've described, and I know that we've 
20 said there is no entrance wounds on his back?

Any way of telling what position that body 
10 was in when those wounds were sustained?

A

No. 
Given that they're arms, it just depends 
13 on where his arms were?

A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And in relation to where the gun was? 
Correct. But I can say to sustain wounds 
17 to the chest, the chest is fixed, those with the 
18 arms it can be in a number of positions. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any other 
20 questions. Does anybody else have anything they 
21 want to cover today?

from the 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So if someone in this 
and it is a gunshot wound, the gun could 
fired from behind them? 
Correct. 
Someone in this position, the gunshot come 
front of them, correct? 
Correct. 
Or in this position, or in this position? 
Correct. 
It is difficult to say, correct, or 
13 impossible to say? 
14 A Correct. 
15 The reason 
16 that you are saying most likely the last is because 
17 the wounds to the chest and the wounds to the arm he 
18 would of had to be somewhat upright to have those 
19 somewhat? 
20 A What's more of an issue he could still be 
21 mobile, he could be moving around, once he got this, 
22 he's going to be unconscious. 
23 He's going to be down and 
24 there is no way to get to his chest if he were down. 
25 A Right, that is true.

19 are --
20 Transcribing.

A I do it after I finish the autopsy. 
Oh, okay. So there is no

2 A As I am going through the autopsy, I want 
3 pictures of this, I need a picture of this, this is 
4 important I think, I need that, that's the extent of 
5 the talking. I'm not, the generation of this 
6 report, this is happening once I complete 
7 everything, I go back to my office with all of my 
8 notes and then I do this on my Dictaphone after 
9 everything is done. 
10 They were there also, they 
11 were present also when the x-rays were going on? 
12 A X-rays, no, they came, once you saw that 
13 picture when he's out of the bag, he has his clothes 
14 on and the placard, that's when they were showing up 
15 and that's when it started. The x-rays are done 
16 before, the process of the body being processed for 
17 me to do my examination, that's happening. 
18 Okay. 
19 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And, in fact, some of 
20 the x-rays, the x-rays are done with his clothing 
21 on, correct? 
A Correct. 22 
23 Q And like in some x-rays you can see the 
24 belt buckle on his pants and so forth? 
25 A Correct.

X-rays are done before the clothes are

A Correct. 
I think this 
7 might be the last question. So in essence, while 
8 you are doing your examine and you have the 
9 onlookers or the people that watch, they take the 
10 photographs, no one actually knows what you are 
11 going to put into your report until your report is 
12 done, is that correct? 
13 A Right. 
14 Thank you. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Just then for the 
16 record, I know this, your report was done in, I 
17 would say in my experience with the Medical 
18 Examiner's Office, in a little speeder fashion, 
19 sometimes it takes six weeks for me to get your

1 Q Did you feel that you didn't have 
2 sufficient time to complete your report at all? 
3 A No, I felt in terms of the adequacy of my 
4 report, I was done with it, the only thing that I 
5 wasn't finished with when I was told that I needed 
6 to finish the report was the histological section of 
7 tissue, that takes awhile for that to be processed. 
8 It can take four weeks sometimes, but I had to speed 
9 that along too. 
10 So I had to finish the bulk of the 
11 report, and then if you look at my last statement. 
12 I comment at the time, the histology examination 
13 will be issued as a supplemental report. 
14 That portion I was not able to 
15 include at the time of this. So this, until the 
16 histology, which I testified to you guys about this 
17 happened after I did this, so that's an additional 
18 important information which helped me understand 
19 better that gunshot wound to the hand. 
20 At this time, I was suspicious of it 
21 being a close range wound until histology came 
22 through, I couldn't definitively say. So in my 
23 report I say, hey, I see these, I see these 
24 discolorations, I have to my histology to confirm. 
25 So now I'm testifying I got that

1 back, I can now say that wound is a close range 
2 wound so, but outside of the rest of everything 
3 else, everything was just fine.

11 provide that to me as soon as it is done? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, I will. 
And so I just want to make clear, this was 
14 done in a speedy manner, was there anything about 
15 this that you felt that if you had more time or were 
16 given, you know, more time to write your report, 
17 that it would be a better report or more accurate? 
18

I signed it that day. And then I gave it 
11 to the officer, Monday an officer came and picked up 
12 my report, which would have been what, the 18th of 
13 that month. 
14 Q Until the officer picked up that report, 
15 you did not discuss this with any police officers 
16 what your findings were? 
17 A No, no one. The only people who were 
18 privy to what I was seeing, what I was dealing with 
19 were the officers who were in the autopsy with me, 
20 that's it.
