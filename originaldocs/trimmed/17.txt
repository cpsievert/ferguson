6 brought more trouble into the area and stuff like 
7 that.

9 my daddy get beat by the police, I've seen friends 
10 of mine will be out, you know, shopping and someone 
11 told them we stole something and just get followed 
12 by the police cars. I never seen, you know, I don't 
13 think he deserves to get killed like that. And that 
14 just kind of proves my whole image of what I thought 
15 of the police. 
16 Q Which is what? 
17 A They abuse their authority to me. 
18 Q Now, in one of your statements you 
19 describe Michael Brown as looking scared when he 
20 turned around. Do you recall that?

23 couldn't actually see his face, could you?

2 experienced or witnessed or that you are aware of 
3 other Ferguson officers? 
4 A No, I don't hold him accountable really.

6 think he just got beside himself. Like, you know, 
7 it turned into, you know, I'm going to tell you kids 
8 you do this, you listen to me, you have an attitude. 
9 And then it turned into him just being frustrated, 
10 that's what it seemed like. 
11 Q Okay. What I want to make sure, 
12 and because this grand jury is going to consider 
13 whether or not to indict the police officer for a 
14 crime. And they're examining what happened that day 
15 so that they can decide that, and I know that you 
16 having had unpleasant or, you know, very bad 
17 experiences with police officers, you know, it gives 
18 you a bad impression of police officers I imagine. 
19 But, you know, they need just to 
20 relate what you saw today. They can only consider, 
21 not that they can't consider other things, do you 
22 know what I'm saying?

A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. 
They kind of built the memorial on top of 
15 the blood stain that was there. So that's where he 
16 was. 
17 Q So you never saw him from the farthest 
18 point that he was east, you never saw him move 
19 toward the officer? 
20 A I didn't see him move toward the officer. 
21 He could have, but I didn't see him do it. 
22 Q So this would have been when you were kind

Now, you said that you saw a woman come 
12 out and say that she had videoed this on her phone? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q Where did you see her when she came out? 
15 A When I first saw her she was standing 
16 right here in front of her apartment complex. After 
17 I had went in the house and came back out, she was

2 the officer took her phone, did you ever see her on 
3 the news? 
4 A No, I was expecting to see that video, but 
5 I didn't. 
6 Q Okay. Now you describe when you said 
7 Michael Brown turned around and you said it looked 
8 like he was scared and today you used the word 
9 cowering. In previous statements you said it was 
10 like he was crouched over. 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
On your recording from previous statements 
13 we can't see what that means because it's an audio 
14 recording. But you demonstrated today, and XXXXXX 
15 was in between you and I so I didn't have a good 
16 look at it. Can you describe or demonstrate what 
17 you meant when he was crouched over or cowering. 
18

20 
A 
like this. 
Q 
Okay. It was like his hands were about 
(indicating) 
Can you stand up? He was standing up at 
21 this point, right? 
22 A Yes. His shoulders were like almost 
23 touching his hands, urn. No, that's kind of like the 
24 stance for self-defense to me. So that's how I said 
25 crouched over.

2 FBI agents and the assistant U.S. attorney, remember 
3 the guy with black hair that you talked to, the 
4 attorney? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And you said to him that Michael 
7 Brown was kind of crouching over and it sounded to 
8 me like maybe you were trying to demonstrate it and 
9 you said, so kind of bent over? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q When you demonstrated it to them, was your 
12 body bent over in any way?

And then you see him run. Does the 
3 officer fire at Michael Brown while he's running 
4 away? 
5 A That I don't remember. I wasn't paying 
6 attention at that point. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A It is from the time that the officer got 
9 out of the car from the gun, or whatever it was on 
10 the ground being picked up or whatever, that part 
11 I'm not sure. 
12 Q Okay. And just to be clear, you said from 
13 the gun being picked up off the ground, but you 
14 don't know for sure what was on the ground; is that 
15 right? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q It was black? 
18 A Yes, it was black. It made like kind of a 
19 plastic metal clink when it hit the ground. That's

A Yes. 2 
3 Q You didn't see who picked it up, you just 
4 know that later it was gone? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Did you see, as the boys were first 
7 walking toward the car, after the officer backed up 
8 and the boys approached the car, did you see 
9 anything in Michael Brown's hands? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Did you ever see Michael Brown hand 
12 anything to the little guy? 
13 A No, I wasn't paying attention. 
14 Q Okay. So just cause you were kind of 
15 talking softly, you said, no, you weren't paying 
16 that close of attention? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Okay. And so after the first gunshot and 
19 Michael Brown backs away, kind of checks himself out 
20 looks like and then he starts to run away, you say 
21 he gets a few steps before he turns around, did you 
22 hear any shots before he turns around? 
23 A I don't remember.

said he took a few steps, half steps 
just like a little shuffle. 
And then did it appear to you that 
5 he had been shot at that point, could you see? 
6 A I couldn't tell, that was too far for 
7 that. 
8 Q Okay. And then you heard several shots in 
9 a row after that? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after those several shots in a 
12 row, was there another series of shots? 
13 A Urn, after, while his body was out there, 
14 but it wasn't. 
15 Q I know there's been people who said there 
16 were gunshots going off in the complex, but I'm 
17 talking about from the officer?

19 
A 
Q 
No.

1 trying to get some idea on this distance here. If 
2 we can probably put it in terms of car lengths, like 
3 a four-door vehicle, can you picture that in your 
4 mind? 
5 
6 
A Yes. 
Okay. Now, when you 
7 started off, when you saw the officer's car, can you 
8 give me an idea how many cars, 4-door cars can fit 
9 between where the police officer's car is and where 
10 you are when you first see him? 
11 A Okay. It will be about probably four or 
12 five car lengths. 
13 
14 lengths, okay. 
15 
16 
A Yes. 
Okay. Four to five car 
Okay. And then when you 
17 got to, were you still at that point when you heard 
18 the first shot go off? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. When I heard the first shot, 
20 I was still by the tree. 
21 Okay. Then when you're at 
22 the bank of the mailboxes, okay, are you still, 
23 okay, where are they then? 
24 A They're still in the same place about 
25 right here. They're still in the same area.

2 Okay. And so from there 
3 to where they are, about how many car lengths would 
4 that be you think? 
5 A From where I was to the police car? From 
6 where I was here to the police car? 
7 Yeah. 
8 A I was closer, I was probably about two or 
9 three car lengths. 
10 Two to three car lengths. 
11 And then at that point you're there about two or 
12 three car lengths, at that point that's when you see 
13 Michael Brown, you see the other bank of shots or 
14 the other shots go off? 
A Yes. 15 
16 Okay. I think that's all 
17 I have. 
18 Okay. On 
19 August the 16th, your interview when you told the 
20 authorities that you were walking home from the 
21 library, you first said that you saw the police 
22 officer back-back, you know, not hard but --

24 Quick stop and almost

1 A Yes. 
2 I call them young men. 
3 You said that, okay, what I need to understand, 
4 cause you are on the same side as them, right? 
5 A I'm on the opposite side of the street. 
6 At the time when you saw 
7 the police? 
8 A Yes, during everything I was on the 
9 opposite side of the street from the police car. 
10 Opposite side would be 
11 A This side of the street. The car was on 
12 this side of the street, parked about right here at 
13 first. (indicating) 
14 Okay. Let me rephrase the 
15 question, you are so right. You are facing the same 
16 side as you are facing to the back of everything 
17 that's going on. 
18 A Yeah, well, I'm facing towards the front 
19 of the police car, but I'm facing the back of the 
20 police officer, but while he was getting shot, I was 
21 still facing toward Michael Brown. 
22 Right. My point is, when 
23 you saw the action going on at the car and the 
24 vehicle, I call it MB and PO, police officer. Did 
25 it look to you when he came back at that quick stop,

1 even though they may have almost gotten hit, you 
2 know, and they jump back, how soon would you say 
3 that the action between MB and the PO took place? 
4 A How soon did he walk up to the car window? 
5 Cause when you say walk up 
6 to the car, I'm thinking somebody almost got hit, 
7 it's like it's right here, I mean, it is like 
8 instant, it is right directly in front of me? 
9 A Yes. 
10 It would be like boom, 
11 boom, you know. 
12 A Uh-huh. 
13 Just a jerk more than not 
14 jump far back. 
15 A Right. 
16 But when you say walk up 
17 to the police car, did he have to like walk some 
18 feet? 
19 A No, just walk from the back of the car to 
20 the driver's window. It wasn't like a walk, it was 
21 just like, you know, probably like three steps. He 
22 was already there by the car. He just walked from 
23 the bumper to the driver's window. 
24 How soon did the 
25 conversation that you did not hear take place?

A How soon after he backed up the car? 
Yeah. 
1 
2 
3 A Urn, like less than five seconds. It was 
4 like instant after that happened, he just charged 
5 right up to the window, he just went right over. 
6 So, and you said that you 
7 saw his body waist up in the car? 
8 A About his arms, shoulders right here like, 
9 you know, somebody reaching, he's reaching in there. 
10 Like they're in there fighting, he's reaching for 
11 something but he's doing something in the car. 
12 His head and chest was 
13 inside the vehicle too? 
14 A His head was in the vehicle at one point 
15 reaching in. 
16 On August the 16th you 
17 never mention that his body was inside the vehicle, 
18 but on September 25th you mention that his body was 
19 inside. You just said that it was his arm, it 
20 looked like they were fighting. 
21 So I'm just confused because like that's a 
22 big gap, that's almost like a month after you had 
23 your first interview. Did you like hear anything on 
24 television or hear anyone in the neighborhood 
25 talking about, you know, what they actually saw?

1 A No, it was just what I remember. It might 
2 be off, but it was like a grapple, you know, head 
3 bobbing and shoulders moving, arms moving. 
4 Okay. Thank you. 
5 Continuing on 
6 that same thought. You know the car backs up, 
7 nearly hits Michael Brown and Dorian. You said 
8 Michael Brown makes his way almost immediately, five 
9 seconds or so, to the driver's side of the car. 
10 Can you tell from your perspectives were 
11 there words exchanged first, or was there kind of

15 When you 
16 moved from the tree to the mailbox, were you walking 
17 or running at that time?

4 Is that the picture, you 
5 are watching the ground as much as maybe you are

10 moving.

14 were moving that you were hearing shots?

5 and shoulders were in the window. And you said,

8 said yeah, his arms basically, you know, steady 
9 reaching in. His whole top half in the window and

14 the same thing. I want to make sure that I'm 
15 reading this correctly. 
16 A Okay. 
17 When he saw him go into 
18 the window, it seemed like he just ran. And then 
19 one of the lady officers, she says, was he in the 
20 window or parts of his body inside the window. And 
21 you said yeah, like his head and shoulders were. 
22 And you said yes, that's what it looked like. 
23 And then later you said you saw Michael

8 were back to back. After about the third one, I did 
9 look and see. 
10 And you said to officer 
11 or district attorney, whatever her name is, 
12 , in one of your statements that you had looked 
13 away. And she said, if I told you we had evidence 
14 that he moved forward toward the police officer, 
15 what would you say about that. You said that might 
16 have been one of the times I was looking away. 
17 A Yeah. 
18 So I understand, you're 
19 doing very well by the way, there's a lot going on, 
20 you are scared? 
A There was a lot going on. 21 
22 I understand, Hon. I 
23 just want to make sure just because you are saying 
24 you didn't see it, doesn't necessarily mean it 
25 didn't happen.

1 A Right, right, that's the point I tried to 
2 make. 
3 Okay. You said today 
4 that you felt like this was murder. Can I ask you 
5 how you felt, I want you to put yourself in the 
6 officer's position. I want you to tell us what you 
7 think he should have done? 
8 A Okay. I mean, even if I heard that people 
9 said that he reached in the truck, even if he did 
10 attack you, he was unarmed. I feel like at the 
11 point he tried to surrender, he could have put 
12 handcuffs on him. They could have maced him, that's 
13 why they have those nightsticks, that's why you have 
14 all these other options. 
15 This is a boy who has no weapons at 
16 all, you exhaust your other options. Injure him, 
17 but why kill him. 
18 Thank you so much. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question.

2 occurred to me because you are a young person. And 
3 I've never asked anybody else, but did you have 
4 headphones or ear buds that day as you were walking 
5 back from the library? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Kids walk around with 
8 headphones on, so you didn't have anything in your 
9 ears? 
10 A No, I just wasn't really, I mean, it was a 
11 lot of noise, a lot of commotion. It's usually a 
12 lot of noise over there. So if they weren't where 
13 they were, I probably wouldn't have heard it. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: You didn't hear any 
15 screaming from anybody? 
16 A No, I wasn't paying attention to it.

2 And I understand now we 
3 know that Michael Brown was not armed? 
4 A Yes. 
5 But at the time we didn't 
6 know that, correct? 
7 A Right. At first I thought it was his gun, 
8 like I thought that's what hit the ground. 
9 So it is reasonable to 
10 think the police officer might think he has a gun. 
11 I'm not saying that he deserved what happened to 
12 him, we just didn't know that?

15 You just 
16 stated to the prosecutor that you never heard the

9 didn't do anything wrong. I mean, from him walking 
10 from the store or anything, or whatever, to the 
11 place out in the street or what the police did, I 
12 didn't know. But I just felt like it was wrong, why 
13 would you shoot an unarmed child with his hands up. 
14 Q And the part you did actually see some 
15 kind of scuffle at the car or you said the officer 
16 snatched him at the car or grabbed him?

1 said something and he pulled back and that's when he 
2 went to grab him by his shoulder. 
3 Q Now, let's go back to when Michael Brown 
4 turned around, had his hands up as you tell us, and 
he was shot at least five or six times as he was 5 
6 walking towards the officer. And did you see him 
7 hit the ground? 
8 A When he hit the ground, he fell hands up 
9 and that's how he was laying.

I don't have the slightest idea, I don't 
4 Was it the officer that did the shooting? 
5 I don't know. 
6 You're not sure? 
8 Initially you thought it was? 
9 I thought it was. 
10 Why did you decide it may not have been? 
11 Because the picture of the police, didn't 
12 look like the picture of the man who checked his 
13 pulse. 
14 Q What picture now? 
15 A On the news, that didn't look like Darren 
16 Wilson who took the pulse.

18 was riding with him? 
19 
20 
A 
Q

Now, on one part of your statement, let's 
21 see, it is on page 17, have you ever looked at your

1 page 17 at the top, before the first shot, you talk 
2 about slamming his hand and like I said once, I 
3 guess once he flung his hand, that's when the first 
4 shot rung off and it hit him. What did you mean by 
5 slam his hand? 
6 A I guess when he grabbed him by his shirt, 
7 you know, reaction from a person grabbing your 
8 shirt, you are going to initially grab his hand to 
9 try to snatch it away or smack his hand away.

11 officer's hand away?

No, ma'am. 
And once Mike Brown is down on the ground, 
16 did the officer shoot any more? 
17 A Somehow, all I know, I didn't know if he 
18 got in the head. We notice there was a blood trail 
19 coming from his head as he was laying on the street. 
20 Q Okay. But my question is, you saw him hit 
21 the ground?

9 agents that the officer shot him while he was on the 
10 ground? 
11 A It could have happened that way like once 
12 he fell. 
13 Q Did you ever think that? 
14 A Yes, I did. 
15 Q Tell us why, tell us a little bit more 
16 like that? 
17 A There was too many shots. After a certain 
18 many shots he fell. And I guess he was going to 
19 make sure, I didn't know if he was absolutely there, 
20 I don't know. It is how it happened.

3 A He could have. 
4 Q What are your thoughts on that in viewing 
5 what you saw? 
6 A I can't say on behalf of the police if he 
7 felt threatened, he could have cause he was a big 
8 guy. I thought he was a grown man when I saw him.

10 A He could have felt threatened because of 
11 his height and his weight. He could have felt 
12 threaten by him.

14 differently. Did it appear to you that Mike Brown

4 Q And so if Michael Brown, I mean, if his 
5 hands were up, at or near or inside that vehicle --
6 A His hands were not in the vehicle at all. 
7 Q Okay. Do you remember saying before that 
8 you couldn't really see either of their hands as far 
9 as what their hands were doing?

11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
I know when he grabbed him by his shirt. 
Right. 
I seen him when he went to go and like 
13 knock his hands back. And that's when the first 
14 shot was fired. 
15 Q Well, you've said in your other statement 
16 that when you talk about the officer putting his 
17 hand out of the car, you say he pulled out and 
18 grabbed him. This is difficult for me to do because 
19 you guys talk over each other in these statements 
20 and so I'm going to do my best and I'm going to show 
21 you this so it will be easier for you to follow 
22 along.

24 conversation and SA, that's special agent, so that's

And you say evidently he already had his 
12 hand on the gun, I was gathering by his word 
13 evidently, that you were guessing at that? 
14 A No, I was saying, what I was saying was 
15 that evidently he had to have his hand on the gun in 
16 order for him to shoot first cause he never had got

No, ma'am. 
And so would it be safe to say that if the 
3 officer had his gun in his hand, and if Michael 
4 Brown had his hand on the officer's gun, you 
5 couldn't see that either, is that fair to say? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. Now, you testified today that when 
8 Michael Brown turned around and he had his hands up, 
9 I don't want to frustrate you, do you want some 
10 water or anything? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
I'm fine. 
And when he turns around with his hands up 
13 you said that, I'm not sure how sure you were to 
14 date on this because you said I think so and then 
15 you said yes. You said that you heard Mike Brown 
16 say, I give up. 
17 A He did. 
18 Q And then you also said you never heard the 
19 officer saying anything? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
He didn't. 
Okay. And I'm going to ask you again in 
22 your first statement to the police, and this was on 
23 August 16th, this happened on August 16th, would 
24 have been the next Saturday when you are talking to 
25 the officers on page 17. And the officer, and

1 you're and this is the special agent. And 
2 you say, and that's when he turned around and he was 
3 going back toward the police, defend, to give up. 
4 And the officer asked, could you hear what was being 
5 said. 
6 And then another officer said do, and 
7 then you said, no, I could not but I --
8 And then the agent says, can't hear 
9 anybody yelling back and --
10 
11 
A 
Q 
I said no. 
And you said no. Back on the 16th you 
12 didn't hear anybody say anything? 
13 A No. Like I said, when the first shot went 
14 off, I know I heard him turn around and say, I give 
15 up. Now, as far as him, I say him defending 
16 himself, I meant to say he was surrendering himself. 
17 Q Okay. I'm sorry, I started before you 
18 finished. 
19 A No, I was just saying that he was going 
20 back to surrender himself. Like I say when he went 
21 back and he turned around, his hands was up.

1 Sheila that you didn't mean --
2 A Right, I really didn't mean to say defend 
3 hisself. 
4 Q My question has to do with the fact that 
5 today you testified that you heard Michael Brown say 
6 I give up? 
7 A He did say I give up. 
8 Q But back on the 16th, a week after this 
9 happened, you said you didn't hear either of them 
10 say anything back and forth, back and forth?

2 there were a lot of people that wish they weren't

2 shooting as he was walking towards him. And as he 
3 was walking towards the guy, he fell down and the 
4 last shot. He didn't stand over him like as if he 
5 walked over to him and stood over him, no, he

5 clarification. When you talked about you were asked 
6 that you wanted to help Michael Brown's family, I

8 How do you want to help them, I'm not clear on that? 
9 A As far as bringing, bringing the truth out 
10 of what really happened. I mean, I didn't feel like 
11 he did anything wrong. He didn't make no --

I 
7 sympathize with your loss, sorry. I understood what 
8 you just told Miss Sheila, let me understand your

10 not justified to you?

12 Regardless, you didn't 
13 know what happened beforehand because like you say, 
14 you just saw the tussling and after that? 
15 A Right. 
16 But as far as him being 
17 dead on the ground. 
18 A Okay. What I'm saying is, if he did 
19 something wrong, and the police had to protect 
20 itself or to defend itself, then that would have 
21 been the case, but for this young man to be walking 
22 down the street, not causing any problems to no one 
23 that was outside, what was the point. You could 
24 have tased him instead of shoot him.

1 in some type of way, you could have tased him. You 
2 didn't have to pull your gun first. He didn't go to 
3 show that he had any weapon on him at all. 
4 So I felt like for him shooting him, 
5 it was just too much. You could have tased him. If 
6 anybody else run up and have an incident with a 
7 police officer, that would be the first thing a 
8 police officer will do to defend themself. If you 
9 felt like he had a weapon or anything. 
10 He didn't show that he had any weapon 
11 at all. He was just walking down the street and him 
12 and his friend having a casual conversation, that's 
13 what I saw out of them, so. 
14 For him to just shoot that young man 
15 like that I didn't think that was right.

2 may have been an accidental shot and it was not a 
3 shot intentionally to injure Mr. Brown? 
4 A It could have been, but that doesn't count 
5 for the rest of the shots that came after that when 
6 he turned around. If that was a warning shot, the 
7 rest of the shots, them or five or six shots 
8 shouldn't have came from behind the first shot that 
9 went off. 
10 Uh-huh. 
11 A I don't feel like it was a warning, I feel 
12 like it was intentionally done because the police 
13 could have been intimated. Like I say, I didn't 
14 know he was a teenager, I thought he was a grown man 
15 when I seen him. 
16 So the police probably was 
17 intimidated of his height, his weight, I don't know, 
18 but I don't feel like it could have been a warning 
19 shot. 
20 But even if that was a 
21 warning shot, that would be an intentional act by 
22 the officer, okay? 
23 A Okay. 
24 So in the realm of 
25 everything, there's a possibility just like the

1 first shot might have been an accident; is that 
2 correct? 
3 A It could have been yes, ma'am. 
4 As you mentioned 
5 again, standing out there, a nice day on a Saturday, 
6 talking with a couple people by the dumpster. A lot 
7 of stuff going on as you mentioned out there. Was 
8 it the act of the police car driving by that drew 
9 your attention to then watch the entire scene, or 
10 was it the first gunshot that had a big conversation 
11 or smoke that drew your attention, what was it that 
12 really made you focus solely on --
13 A What made me focused is when they pulled 
14 back towards them. 
15 Okay. 
16 A What could they do. They was walking 
17 across the street, they couldn't have been doing too 
18 much, they wasn't doing anything. 
19 There wasn't any sound 
20 associated with it, okay. Okay, thank you.

22 questions.

A That's fine. 2 
3 I just want to verify on 
4 page 29 of your statement, you said that, just now, 
5 that was what I was going to ask you, You 
6 said the gunshot is what made me look for real? 
7 A Yeah. 
8 We've established you 
9 were looking through a car window that was tinted, 
10 past one officer to another officer from the 
11 opposite side of the street, and you really weren't 
12 paying attention until you actually heard that first 
13 gunshot, okay? 
14 A Uh-huh. 
15 We've already established 
16 that could have been an accident on either person's 
17 side. The officer or Michael, they could have been 
18 tussling. You didn't see his head, so you don't 
19 know if he was in the car, right? 
20 A No. 
21 You couldn't see the top 
22 of his head? 
23 A No.

25 was not in the car?

3 established when you said the officer stood up over 
4 him and emptied, and you didn't finish that, but 
5 that's what it felt like to you, right?

8 A Right.

A Yes, I did. 11 
12

After you got done, did 
you see on his balcony? 
14 A He was on his balcony and I was walking 
15 like back towards my car, where the car was. And I 
16 asked him for a cigarette and he threw it down and 
17 that's when I saw 
18 Outside? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. 
20 And then today before you

1 let me find my notes. That you heard him say I give 
2 up after the first shot? 
3 A Yeah, no, no, when he walk, when he come 
4 back, when he was running towards, he didn't say 
5 when he turned around, when he noticed, I guess, 
6 when he was shot, when he turned back around to walk 
7 back towards the police, he was giving up. He was 
8 surrendering hisself. 
9 I have a question for you 
10 
11 
about that. I'm not saying he wasn't truly giving 
up. If you were in the same situation and you were 
12 giving up, would you continue to walk toward the 
13 police officer or would you stop and get down? 
14 A I probably would have stopped and got 
15 down. 
16 So if you're telling me 
17 that you would have stopped and got down, and the 
18 reasonable thing would be to stop and get down. And 
19 a 6'5", 285 pound man, even though he may have his 
20 hands like this coming towards you, do you think 
21 it's possible the police officer could have 
misunderstood his act of surrender? (indicating) 22 
23 A He probably could have misunderstood, but 
24 that still didn't give him no reason cause he still 
25 didn't ever move his hands from out of the air. I

16 you saw Michael and Dorian walking west Canfield. 
17 That it was 30 minutes roughly that they came back. 
18 Was there something different?

5 MS. ALIZADEH: We're back on the record 
6 and we took a few minutes for a break. While 
7 Witness Number 46 needed to kind of have a break to 
8 collect herself. And she has asked if me could she 
9 come in here and try to finish explaining what she 
10 saw. So rather than me ask you questions, I felt 
11 like maybe I was upsetting you. I'm going to let 
12 you just finish telling what you saw. And if they 
13 have questions, they can ask you, okay. This is 
14 their investigation and they will ask you questions 
15 if they need you to explain, okay. 
16 A Yes. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: So Witness Number 46, why 
18 don't you start from where you said the officer was, 
19 Michael Brown is moving away from the officer and 
20 the officer starts shooting and then you can pick 
21 up, that's kind of where we were and you can just 
22 finish or keep going from there, okay. 
23 A Okay. Michael Brown, which I call Big 
24 Daddy, the police fired and the young man turned and

1 communicating mean I don't have anything, but he 
2 said it loud, not in a low tone voice, in a holler 
3 voice is I don't have anything. 
4 And the other young man, which is 
5 small ball, he was on the other side, but he was 
6 diagonally like a distance from like me and you. 
7 And the young man kept walking fast 
8 and the police had shot one shot, I don't know where 
9 it hit or what, because at that time I put my head 
10 down behind, you know, the wheel. I raised back up 
11 and the police just kept firing and the second shot, 
12 which I seen that hit the boy cause he jumped. I 
13 don't know where it hit him at, but it hit the boy. 
14 And the police just kept firing and saying something 
15 to the boy, and kept firing. The boy kept saying, I 
16 got, my hands is up, I don't have anything, what do 
17 you want. 
18 And next thing I know, I don't know 
19 where it hit, but when the boy fell, there was blood 
20 shot everywhere. 
21 And the police just stand over him 
22 and shot him like he playing darts at a board. At 
23 that time the police, the other boy was gone, not 
24 gone, but standing and off to the side. Mostly 
25 toward the passenger side of the street.

1 And when the policeman kept shooting 
2 at him like he's a dartboard, I got out of my car, 
3 and I went to the police I said, can I help the 
4 young man, can I please help him, he's bleeding. 
5 The police told me. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You can say the bad word. 
7 A The police told me, get the fuck away from 
8 over here. When he told me that, I turned around 
9 and I said, you ain't said nothing but a word. So I 
10 jump back in the car, this time I started panicking. 
11 So I pulled my car into the complex, 
12 I call my and I told her I just seen a 
13 boy got shot. For what, I said I don't know, I 
14 don't know, he's shot. He's in the street. She 
15 said what street, I said right on the side of your 
16 house, and they said they heard gunshot, so 
17 everybody started coming outside. 
18 By this time a young man, I don't 
19 know who he is, gave me a cigarette. I haven't 
20 smoked a cigarette since I was young. I smoke now. 
21 I took the cigarette, I smoked it and then I asked 
22 for more cigarettes, the guy gave me three 
23 cigarettes. I smoked it, I walked back up there, 
24 after the police told me to get away.

1 people, and this is before they put that orange tape 
2 around or yellow tape around, and I asked, I said 
3 what is going on here. Everybody was hollering and 
4 stuff, everybody was crying this, somebody said call 
5 the police, and one lady said that is the police. 
6 And the only thing I just remember 
7 from that that I was screaming and hollering, people 
8 was hugging me, I don't even know nobody out there 
9 besides my 
10 And I told them, like I told Kathi 
11 and the other lady, if I could have saved him, 
12 because , I thought I could save him, I 
13 wanted to save him, not because he was bleeding, 
14 because any time, say for instance if you look at, 
15 what if that's your child laying on that ground. 
16 What if that's your daughter laying up there that 
17 the police shot. What would you do. Would you sit 
18 there and see somebody else's child that I don't 
19 even know lay on the ground? 
20 Flashbacks went in my mind. That's 
21 my boy. I don't know these kids, but just think 
22 y'all, what if that's your boy. Picture your boy

14 could have done to save him. 
15 A I feel that maybe I could have stopped the

Okay. Could you hear him saying anything? 
No, ma'am. 
You weren't close enough to hear them 
No, ma'am. 
What do you think the officer should have 
Anything other than kill him. I'm pretty 
19 sure the police training and police training they,

6 around, I'm not sure. 
7 Q But you didn't record the actual shooting, 
8 you weren't quick enough to do that? 
9 
10 
A 
Q

MS. WHIRLEY: Questions. 
13 When 
14 you were looking at the police car, you were looking 
15 at what, the driver's side or the passenger side? 
16 A Passenger side. 
17 Passenger side. So the 
18 police vehicle was facing west or toward West 
19 Florissant. 
20 A No, it was facing towards east, going 
21 towards Northwinds. 
22 That way's east. If it 
23 was facing east, then the driver's side would have 
24 been toward you?

2 All right. You were at 
3 an angle? 
4 A Yes, ma'am-- yes, sir, I apologize. 
5 
6 
That's close enough. 
I just 
7 need to clarify something. Did you hear any shots 
8 while you were walking back into the apartment to 
9 get your cell phone? 
10 A No, ma'am. 
11 The first shot you 
12 actually heard when you came back out? 
13 A The first shot I heard was when I was 
14 inside. 
15 You heard one while you 
16 was on the inside? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 That was the shot you 
19 heard? 
20 
21 
22 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? 
23 I guess, did you 
24 have head phones or anything on, were you listening 
25 to music out on the balcony or playing a video game

I'm just sitting out there. 
Just watching? 
Just watching, looking around. 
I had another question. I 
6 guess you know when you looked up and saw Michael 
7 Brown at the police car, something must have made 
8 you want to think it is more than just an innocent, 
9 you know, stop right there. Because you ran in to 
10 get your phone, can you think of why or what made 
11 you think there was something to record? Did you 
12 hear loud voices, did you look at Michael's face, 
13 did you know something was about to happen. 
14 A It was just a gut feeling. Something just 
15 toll me in my mind that you might want to go get 
16 your phone. 
17 So you just saw a few 
18 seconds of that, whatever happened there. And then 
19 it sounds like you just saw the very last few 
20 seconds at the end before Michael Brown was shot to 
21 death? 
22 
23 
A Yes, sir. 
Okay. Thank you.

It was in the kitchen. 
3 Was it plugged in a charger at that time? 
4 A No, ma'am. 
5 Okay. When you came from 
6 the balcony into the house to get your cell phone, I 
7 think you have to enter through the sliding doors in 
8 the living room, is that how you enter your 
9 apartment? 
10 A You can or you can just go through the 
11 main door. 
12 The main door, how did you 
13 get in there? 
14 A I went through the door. 
15 
16 
You went through the door?
