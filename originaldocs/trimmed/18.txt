GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XVIII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
November 3, 2014 
Page 5 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is Monday, November 3rd, 
5 it is 9:26 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh. Sheila 
6 Whirley is present as well, and all 12 grand jurors 
7 are here, as well as the court reporter, who's 
8 taking down and recording what is being said. 
9 Some matters that I wanted to discuss 
10 before we start with evidence today. I would like 
11 you all to give us some dates for next week. And, 
12 you know, I had told you in the past that we are 
13 getting close to wrapping up, but you know, I don't 
14 know how long, you know, this is still going to last 
15 for sure and, of course, I don't know how long. We 
16 don't know how long you will need to deliberate. 
17 And so just go ahead and pick some dates 
18 for next week. If you could give us three days, 
19 that would be great. I understand, you know, with 
20 your schedules, you have to work around and we will 
21 work around those schedules. 
22 A couple of other matters is the floor 
23 plan with no door, remember the floor plan? So I 
24 had Detective talk to the gal, the leasing 
25 agent and she drew the door in here. They didn't

1 change it other than she drew a little line where 
2 the door is on these second two bedroom version. 
3 And then she also wrote next to the marks, which 
4 would indicate a window, she wrote sliding door. 
5 These are new, I don't know if you all got 
6 rid of the old ones that I've given you. If you 
7 haven't, go ahead, and you want to give those to me 
8 and I will shred them so we don't get those 
9 confused. That's your newest version of that. 
10 So, for the record, I had previously 
11 marked that floor plan as Exhibit Number, Grand Jury 
12 Exhibit Number 51. I'm going to remark the new one 
13 that shows the door, as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
14 51. And I'm going to tear up the old one so we 
15 don't get those confused. I'm just using the same 
16 number, I just replace it with the accurate version. 
17 And then so we have the week scheduled out 
18 pretty busy, hopefully we're going to be chugging 
19 along here and trying to get some of these witnesses 
20 in and out. 
21 We talked about you all seeing the 
22 vehicle. We actually had a plan, we were going to 
23 try to do that today, we have now discovered because 
24 I had, I don't know if I was told this or I don't 
25 recall who even told me, I had believed that Officer

1 Wilson's vehicle was back in service and the door 
2 had been repaired and it was back on the road being 
3 used as a police car in Ferguson. 
4 But last week we learned that it is not 
5 repaired and it is still missing the door. So we 
6 can't really have somebody drive it down here. It 
7 would draw too much attention if that was driving 
8 around like that. 
9 So I have a couple of options for you. We 
10 could have the vehicle towed to a location where the 
11 new call center is. There is a secure garage in 
12 there. We could have the vehicle towed there and 
13 then we could have you all, depending on the time of 
14 day we do this. If we do it at the end of the day, 
15 you all take your own vehicles out there, then you 
16 could leave directly from there rather than coming 
17 back to Clayton, or if necessary, we could get a van 
18 and take you all out there together to see it. 
19 Of course, then we'd have to bring you 
20 back here to get your vehicles, so that is an 
21 option. If you want to see the actual Ferguson 
22 vehicle. 
23 The limitations with that are going to be 
24 that the door is not on the car. And we have the 
25 door and I can throw the door in the back of the

1 truck and you all can look at the door, but it is 
2 not going to be on the car. 
3 And so depending on what you want to see, 
4 it might be a better option for you if I could get a 
5 Ferguson Tahoe, same year and same model and 
6 everything, and that way you would have a complete 
7 truck, in other words. 
8 I will also tell you that I had someone 
9 from the Crime Scene Unit go out and measure the 
10 actual truck, the actual Ferguson vehicle points 
11 like from the ground to the top, you know, the roof 
12 from the ground to this and so forth. So we do have 
13 actual measurements if those are important to you, 
14 we'll give those to you as well. 
15 So maybe during your lunch break today you 
16 can talk about whether or not, if we just get a 
17 lookalike Ferguson truck, we can do that here, we 
18 had previously talked about doing that in the 
19 sallyport here which is where prisoners are brought 
20 in so they are automatic doors, it is secured, we 
21 would be able to have that area for 30 minutes. 
22 It is monitored by cameras because it has 
23 to be, but we've arranged that the cameras would be 
24 shut off so nobody is going to be seeing you. 
25 Of course, no recordings will be made of

1 you while you are up around the vehicle. If we get 
2 the lookalike, we can do it here. If we are going 
3 to need the actual vehicle, we are going to have to 
4 make the arrangements to take you to another 
5 location to view that. So you can talk during your 
6 lunch break about what you want to do, or if you 
7 want to do both. If it is important that you see 
8 both, we'll do whatever, okay. 
9 How y'all doing, okay. I can't recall if 
10 there was any other things that needed to be talked 
11 about or brought up and if there are, yes. 
12 I saw on KSDK over the 
13 weekend, or I think late last week, that they 
14 indicated that Dr. who did the family 
15 autopsy had mentioned that he was willing to come 
16 and testify before us and also that there is 
17 reportedly some of his findings doesn't agree with 
18 our findings regarding some, I guess it is stippling 
19 or whatever. So I know you put it out there already 
20 inviting him to come at your request to come 
21 testify. 
22 I don't know if you've heard from him? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: The latest is we are trying 
24 to get him here. He had not, still has not 
25 completed his report. And he indicated that he

1 needed a copy of the St. Louis County Medical 
2 Examiner's Report in order for him to complete his 
3 report, which is protocol, it is. 
4 And you will hear from medical examiners 
5 we are going to bring in that that's necessary 
6 because obviously when you are doing a second or 
7 third autopsy, things that were done previously, you 
8 need to know is this something that, you know, was 
9 caused or created in the autopsy or is this a 
10 different wound. And so it is not unusual and in 
11 fact, you know, I don't want to say protocol, I 
12 think that is the appropriate medical procedure is 
13 to have the previous autopsy reports so that you can 
14 know what was done previously. 
15 Obviously, the bullets were removed 
16 already and things that were done are not going to 
17 be seen in a second or third autopsy. 
18 So we have forwarded a copy of that to the 
19 appropriate people to get to him. And so we've also 
20 contacted the appropriate people to have him check 
21 his schedule, let us know when he might be 
22 available. 
23 Obviously, we can't wait if I'm not 
24 available until January, we're going to have to make 
25 a decision on what to do about that in the event

1 that happens. But yes, we have things in place 
2 right now where we are trying to get him to come 
3 here and testify for you. 
4 So that's being done and was there any 
5 other things that you guys wanted or needed that? 
6 I was going to 
7 see, we have learned a lot about Michael Brown 
8 through testimony. I still don't know a lot about 
9 Officer Darren Wilson. 
10 I know we brought his supervisor in 
11 briefly to talk about protocol, what happened that 
12 day. His story was very different from Darren 
13 Wilson's. Would be interested to know if we know 
14 about what his morning was like. 
MS. ALIZADEH: What? 15 
16 What his morning was like 
17 that day. History, you know, behavioral, awards, 
18 whatever that may be. I know a lot about Michael 
19 Brown, but not a lot about Darren Wilson. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: We have his personnel file 
21 and that is something we will get to you. Kind of 
22 our strategy here is once we get done with all of 
23 our eyewitnesses, then we are going to have some 
24 experts still testify. And then probably the last 
25 witness is going to be Detective

who is the

Page 12 
1 primary case officer on this. And so a lot of, some 
2 of that stuff is going to come in through him. 
3 But we talked about the fact that there 
4 may have been witnesses who testified earlier in the 
5 process that now that you know more than you did 
6 back then, you may wish us to recall some witnesses. 
7 As you know, we cannot compel Officer 
8 Wilson to testify. So all I could do is extend an 
9 invitation if you wanted him to come back. 
10 If anybody else that now you look at, you 
11 know, what you now know and you are comparing what 
12 the witness said previously. If you have additional 
13 questions for any witness who has already testified, 
14 just let us know and we will do our best to get them 
15 in here again. 
16 So we talked about that last week that you 
17 know, this whole thing began two months ago so and 
18 you've heard from, you know, what am I on now, how 
19 many witnesses have we had, 47. We have had 47 
20 
21 
witnesses. So it is a lot. 
So you guys can discuss that as well. If 
22 you want to recall any witnesses and again, it would 
23 be an invitation to Officer Wilson if you wanted to 
24 have him back. We would do what we can to get him 
25 here.

Other matters is that we have the taped 
statement of who testified last week 
3 and it is an hour and 26 minutes or so. And if you 
4 would like to hear that statement, we could play it. 
5 If you just want to get the transcript, I can pass 
6 that out to you, but that's something you can 
7 discuss during lunch as well if you want to hear her 
8 statement because we've got a witness here now so 
9 we're going to play some statements of that witness 
10 and then get her on the stand. 
11 And then when this is close to being 
12 concluded, Sheila and I are going to have to go 
13 through the notes and the transcripts to make sure 
14 that we've given you, we kind of got out of playing 
15 all the statements before the witness and, you know, 
16 we've proceeded with okay, we'll play those later. 
17 I want to make sure that we don't miss anything that 
18 there was a statement that we forgot to play or 
19 present to you. 
20 So we'll make sure we try to get that the 
21 boxes checked off to make sure you guys have heard 
22 everything. 
23 So at this time now we're going to play 
24 some recorded statements from a witness who we will 
25 identify as Witness Number 48.

1 We have transcripts for two statements. 
2 The first statement is ten minutes and 58 seconds. 
3 The second statement is a minute 35 seconds, which 
4 is just a phone call and then we have transcripts 
5 for those two. 
6 Then there is a third statement that is 22 
7 minutes and 32 seconds with no transcript for that 
8 since that was just done last week, and so I would 
9 ask that we'll go pause the recording while we are 
10 playing statements. , you do not need to 
11 transcribe the first two statements, but I would ask 
12 that you transcribe for the third one. 
13 So at this time, if you the want to pause 
14 that. 
15 So now that we're paused, I will tell you 
16 the two transcripts are together. 
17 A whole list of all the 
18 witnesses so we make sure that we have them also 
19 what you have. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Absolutely, I have been 
21 keeping track of that. 
22 The other thing is over the weekend I was 
23 trying to organize the exhibits and I'm still 
24 missing Number 48. So if anybody keeps track of the 
25 numbers.

2 A (Shakes head.) I mean, nothing really to 
3 talk about. Just seen somebody get shot, okay. I 
4 mean, it is tragic, but I didn't know him so I 
5 didn't have sympathy for what was going on. I felt 
6 like he brought it on himself because if you are 
7 going to go rob a place and then fight with the 
8 officer, of course they're going to shoot you. 
9 Q So let's back up now. You commented just 
10 now if you are going to rob a place and then fight 
11 with the police officer. Now, you didn't see --
12 A I didn't see the robbery or the fight with 
13 the officer, no, I didn't.

15 things that you learned afterwards?

2 place. I didn't know why they were doing it. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A I didn't know his name until long 
5 afterwards either. 
6 Q When did you learn, if you remember, that 
7 Michael Brown, or when did you hear that Michael

They had burned down the QuikTrip on West

2 kind of discuss it with each other just because oh, 
3 my God, can we believe we just saw that? 
4 A I mean, we were surprised and, you know, 
5 but never really talked about it like that. 
6 Q So you never like, you know that your mom 
7 had talked to the police, right? 
8 A Yeah, but I was trying to avoid her giving 
9 them my name. So, yeah, I really wasn't talking to 
10 her. 
11 Q You know that your dad talked to the 
12 police? 
13 A Uh-huh. 
14 Q And do you know that I have talked to your 
15 parents about trying to get you to call me, did they 
16 talk to you about that? 
17 A Yeah, they contacted me and told me you 
18 were trying to call me and I called several times 
19 and I didn't know your name. So they were like, 
20 well, if you don't have her name, we can't help you.

16 we were there it did not happen. 
17 Q Okay. This is one of those things that 
18 always want to make sure to clarify when you say no, 
19 you didn't see it on anything. My question is, is 
20 that because it didn't happen or are you saying I

9 Q As far as how Michael Brown was, I know 
10 you already described what you observed as far as 
11 his arms and you said you couldn't see his hand, but 
12 did you see his body moving in any way or was he 
13 standing still? 
14 A He was just standing there. I don't think 
15 he was really moving like, nothing like that in 
16 front of the cruiser and then you see him take off 
17 running after the first two shots that's all I seen. 
18 Q All right. So now you're saying that you 
19 didn't want your mom to give the police your name, 
20 is that because you didn't want to be involved or is

4 started, were you focused on what was going on in 
5 front of you? 
6 A I was not when it first happened, I didn't 
7 really pay attention until the first gunshot, but

10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So my question is in 
11 response to one of the questions of the grand 
12 jurors, were you paying attention to what the girl 
13 was doing the whole time, or was it that after it 
14 was over you looked there and she was still there? 
15 How do you know she stayed next to your van the 
16 whole time? 
17 A Because she was there when we, when 
18 everything was getting ready to turn off, she was 
19 still standing by the side of my vehicle. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
21 A She was walking up the street when we 
22 stopped. You seen her walking up the street, I 
23 mean, I pay attention to everything that's going on 
24 around me.

A He didn't do that. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I want to make sure I heard 
20 clearly. When he turned around and charged the 
21 officer, he only moved two feet, two to three feet. 
22 A I'm not exactly sure how many feet it was, 
23 but I know for a fact that he was in front of this

5 charging at the officer once he turned around? 
6 A Right. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: So you're saying he only 
8 moved a couple of feet, though, in that charge? 
9 A Well, yeah, because he didn't get far 
10 before the officer started firing because I wasn't 
11 going to, he didn't let anyone run up on him. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: So as soon as he turned 
13 around and started moving towards the officer two to 
14 three feet, the officer started firing?

MS. WHIRLEY: Is that right?

19 want to make sure I understand. What you are 
I just 
20 saying, you are saying that the officer started 
21 shooting when Michael Brown ran to two or 
22 three feet, charged two or three feet, you're not 
23 saying that's all he charged? 
24 A That's not all he charged, but like he

1 charging, he told him to stop like three times. 
2 Like two or three feet he got before they started 
3 shooting. He kept running. 
4 Okay. 
5 A Like the first few bullets didn't have any 
6 phase in it, he just kept running. 
7 So he didn't just go two 
8 or three feet, he went two or three feet when the 
9 officer started shooting? 
10 A Correct. 
11 again. 
12 Could you see, I guess in one of your transcripts, 
13 you said he shot him three times. Did he actually 
14 see him getting shot three times? 
15 A I don't know if it made contact. He fired 
16 his gun three times at first. 
17 Okay. 
18 A And then he said stop some more and he 
19 kept coming and then he fired the gun four more 
20 times. 
21 Could you demonstrate how 
22 he turned, or when he stopped and turned around and 
23 started coming back towards the officer? 
24 A Yeah, but like when he was running away,

1 of like he put his arms up and he started charging 
2 towards the officer like this. (indicating) 
3 Okay. So he never did 
4 this? (indicting) 
5 A For a second it looked like he was going 
6 to put his hands up, but he brought it back down. 
7 When he charged the officer like that, that's when 
8 you heard the first three gunshots. 
9 I don't know where he, I guess the 
10 little thing on the fucking news where it had it in 
11 his hands. So that's where I assumed where it hit 
12 him. I did not see it hit him. 
13 You are saying he went 
14 like this and then like this? (Indicating) 
15 A Yeah, he kind of like, he thought about 
16 putting his hands up for a second. He just didn't 
17 do it. 
18 Is that when he proceeded 
19 to charge this officer? 
20 
21 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Let me make sure I'm 
22 clear. This is really an important part for a lot 
23 of, I think the grand jurors. When you said it 
24 looked like he was thinking about putting his hands 
25 up or not?

1 A That's the point, it looked like he may 
2 have thought about it. Like he wanted to. 
3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So was he doing it? 
4 A No, he like, his hands were open at first, 
5 and it looked like his arms were going to start to 
6 go up. 
7 Q Did they go up at all? 
8 A He got like shoulder length like this and 
9 then he balled his hands up and then he went like, 
10 folder his arms in and started charging towards him. 
11 Q Okay. So you demonstrated that his hands 
12 were open and they went up shoulder length and then 
13 they came down and balled up? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q And that's when you said he charged at the 
16 first two to three feet? 
17 A Right. 
18 Q The officer shot him several times, you 
19 think three, so that didn't stop him? 
20 A It was three at first. I don't know if

1 Q He kept running toward the officer? 
2 A He kept trying to charge him. 
3 Q Do you have any idea how he came to the 
4 officer. After those three shots? 
5 A Right. And then he fired four more rounds 
6 and then it was like maybe two rounds after that. 
7 Maybe one or two. 
8 Q Okay. When he fired the four more rounds, 
9 what did Mike Brown do? 
10 A He kind of stopped. He kind of staggered 
11 a little bit and then he kept kind of coming forward 
12 but he was running as fast as he was. And then I 
13 heard the last two shots, I believe it was. And 
14 then you seen him like stop and he fell to his knees 
15 and his face hit the concrete kind of hard.

Q

15 total steps? 
Steps, like footprints? 
Each step, to me a step is like two or 
8 three feet, and you are describing two or three 
9 feet, in my mind that's one step. Is it more than

2 parked here by the trees? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Not that this is the

6 down? 
7 A Uh-huh. 
8 Did you ever see the

A Correct.

MS. WHIRLEY: That's an interesting point. 
17 You characterize it as charge, could he 
18 have been staggering? 
19 A When he first started running, ma'am, he 
20 was not staggering. He was charging this officer 
21 and that's how I feel it was, like he was running 
22 towards him. If he had got close enough, I feel 
23 like he would have tackled him up against the car.

1 Q So they were near the cruiser when he came 
2 back? 
3 A He was coming this way going west towards 
4 this and the cruiser was here. He was running past 
5 this actual not too far behind the cruiser and was 
6 saying stop, stop, stop and that's when he started 
7 firing and the officer went this way instead of 
8 going back towards the cruiser, he came across the 
9 street this way. 
Q The officer did? 
A Yes. 
10 
11 
12 Q Okay. So the first shots, you felt he was 
13 charging him after the first shots, do you still 
14 feel he was charging? 
15 A The first three shot after that he was 
16 still charging at him and then after the fourth 
17 shot, it looked like he was staggering.

19 Could you not 
20 see his face?

1 was kind of like running like, like I said, like a 
2 football tackle, like he was going to tackle the 
3 officer. I couldn't really see the expression on 
4 his face. 
5 Okay. So it is not that 
6 you were too far to see it, it was just that you 
7 weren't at a good angle to see it? 
8 A Correct.

other than that, 
13 I mean, do you feel like 
14 this could have ended up any other way?

16 stopped running, yeah, it could have ended a 
17 different way.

19 he could have ended another way, the officer had no

A Good afternoon. 15 
16 Q Now, you were here previously on 
17 October 23rd and you gave some testimony, and then 
18 we actually had to recess early that day and we 
19 weren't able to complete your testimony, so thank 
20 you for coming back today. 
21 What I want to start with, though, is 
22 that after your testimony on October 23rd. You and 
23 I had a phone conversation where I had called you 
24 because we were trying to figure out another date 
25 for you to come back, do you recall that?

21 A Urn, since my prior accident, my doctor 
22 told me to write down everything so that I don't

11 in that car accident? 
12 A Yes, I went through the windshield of the 
13 car head first. 
14 Q And so, I don't say this to embarrass you, 
15 I think you already have talked about this when you 
16 were here on the 23rd. Do you have any mental 
17 health issues? 
18 A I'm bipolar. 
19 Q And do you take medication for that? 
20 A Urn, not for the bipolar, well, the 
21 medication that I take works both for migraine 
22 headaches and the bipolar, but it is actually

7 was nuts for taking a drive up there, and second, to 
8 keep my mouth shut. He's probably right, no one

20 or meet up with her, she did not know I was coming. 
21 Q So she could not corroborate that you were 
22 coming up to North County that day? 
23 A Correct.

What? 
Do you think it's possible you believe you

13 really weren't up there? 
14 A I was up there and I wrote it before it 
15 ever even hit the news.

9 that you were up there and you witnessed what you 
10 testified about and what you told the FBI agents

12 A That I was really there, yes. I would go

9 talk about you raising money or starting a website, 
10 fundraiser for Darren? 
11 A Yes, ma'am, but it is not for Darren 
12 Wilson. We have local elementary schools making 
13 Christmas cards. 
14 Q I think you said first responders? 
15 A First responders, yes, ma'am. But the

2 MS. ALIZADEH: And that is true. Also for 
3 the court reporter because he can't, it is very 
4 tough for him to take it down when people are 
5 talking at the same time. So go ahead, continue. 
6 I'm just 
7 getting to the point where you said you were going 
8 to find a random black neighborhood and then you 
9 just made a statement you were looking for 
10 that lived in Florissant. I'm trying to figure 
11 which one is it? 
12 A That's not the reason I went up there. I 
13 went to find the random black neighborhood like my 
14 journal says. Then I thought, I mean, I picked that 
15 neighborhood because of had no idea that I 
16 was anywhere in the area or that I was coming. 
17 You picked the 
neighborhood before you left ? 18 
19 A Correct. I picked the general vicinity, 
20 yes. 
21 When 
22 you are reading your journal from 4:00, basically 
23 what I have here is you explained what you saw, and

A I don't know where that came in.

13 confused. I understand that. I want to know, just 
14 look at me and tell me, what you are telling us --
15 A Yes, ma'am. 
16 Is you saw Michael Brown 
17 charging the officer without a doubt in your mind. 
18 This young man didn't have a reason to do this, so 
19 could you have been mistaken about what you saw?

22 Okay.

24 No.

1 is that he was charging the officer, but you don't 
2 know for sure exactly what was going on. You were 
3 lost, you were out of your surroundings? 
4 A Correct. 
5 So you can't really say 
6 exactly what was going on? 
7 A Correct. And also, according to my 
8 journal, I guess the recollection of the officer's 
9 talking to the two boys before he backed up was what 
10 I read online and not what I seen. 
11 So you think there could 
12 have been, and you have said this, there is a lot of 
13 blurry lines there as far as what you read and what 
14 you really saw. So all you have to do is these 
15 bullet points about what you think you saw on that 
16 day and this was at 4:00, so this was after a three 
17 and a half hour time frame when you are trying to 
18 find your way home, you are trying to find, you are 
19 getting lost in the neighborhood. 
20 I'm not saying you are lying, 
21 (sic) I'm really not. I think you are confused. I 
22 want you to understand what you're saying could have 
23 been misunderstood.

4 to you or did you come to them or on the phone or 
5 what? 
6 A I went to them. I believe it was here,

10 or was it all of them?

2 Q So you don't know when you're telling the 
3 truth? 
4 A No. I know what I had seen and what I had 
5 read online for the first day itself right prior to 
6 going up there would have became jumbled, and than I 
7 would have gotten facts confused because my memory 
8 would have been gone as far as what I truly seen

11 you are telling the truth and when you are telling 
12 something that you may have just read?

6 they are a Motorola dealer, was with them for 17 
7 years. Prior to that, another three years with a 
8 radio distributor.

Right. Past 23 years, yes. 
And do you have, well, can you tell the

14 A Sure. I hold an associate's degree in 
15 electronic technology in communications. I also 
16 hold a ham radio licenses and an FCC license, which 
17 gives me the opportunity to work on large 
18 transmitters for like broadcasters and everything. 
19 Twenty years ago that was one of the keynote things 
20 that you had to have to be able to get into this 
21 field.

1 had training. So on a yearly basis I had to go for 
2 updates on the new technology that was coming out. 
3 Q So were you working for the, as a Motorola 
4 salesperson back when the City of Ferguson got their 
5 radio system installed. 
6 A Right. Back then, and it has got to be 
7 six, seven, I would have to look back, I replaced 
8 their console, their dispatch console from a button 
9 to a CTR, a computer driven dispatch console, which 
10 is used just to dispatch and turn on the radio 
11 transmitters along with filling in with some new 
12 portable and mobile radios. 
13 There is about a 10 to 12 year life 
14 expectancy on mobiles and portables. At that time 
15 they needed new equipment and I sold them the new 
16 equipment and also programmed it with the 
17 frequencies that was needed. 
18 Q And you think that that was about six 
19 years ago or thereabouts? 
20 A Six to eight years. They usually buy 
21 different times of the year because of their 
22 budgets. One year they might budget for ten radios 
23 and next year five radios. The following year new 
24 mobile radios.

3 Q And so do you think, are you familiar with 
4 the radio system that the Ferguson Police Department 
5 uses? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And, urn, are you aware that 
8 Ferguson dispatches for themselves? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so what does that mean, what does a 
11 dispatcher, and explain what it means when a 
12 municipality may dispatch for themselves as opposed 
13 to something else. 
14 A Well, they take the 911 call, they're 
15 considered a peace effort. It is a public safety 
16 answering point, they take the 911 calls, they look, 
17 they usually have a CAD system, computer added 
18 dispatch piece of software that they type in the 
19 address and they assign it at car and that car is 
20 then dispatched through the console, radio console. 
21 Q And so I understand that this is all done 
22 with computers, but there is a person who is the 
23 dispatcher, correct?

1 municipalities dispatch for themselves? 
2 A No, in Ferguson's case they have Country 
3 Club Hills and Calverton Park, and the new entity 
4 Flordell Hills. They dispatch for those three other 
5 agencies also. 
6 Q Are there some municipalities that you are 
7 aware of where St. Louis County communications 
8 dispatches for some municipalities? 
9 A Off the top of my head, there is like 23 
10 different agencies that they dispatch their 
11 departments. 
12 Q Okay. So let's get some, I guess, 
13 vocabulary out of the way. You talked about a 
14 transmitter. What is a transmitter? 
15 A Transmitter is basically a box and it has 
16 a components for transmitting at different power 
17 levels they are programmable it is also box 
18 transmitter also is a receiver so it also receives 
19 radio transmissions as well as when the dispatcher 
20 keys up or pushes the talk button it turns 
21 transmitter on and the voice goes out through the 
22 transmitter. 
23 Q Okay. And where is the Ferguson Police 
24 Department transmitter? 
25 A

It is on their back parking lot where

1 there is a cell tower that's back there and their 
2 tower and their antennas are on top of that tower. 
3 At the bottom of this tower is a little shelter that 
4 their transmitters are placed. 
5 Q So the antenna is on a tower and the 
6 transmitter is on a box inside the shelter? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And then this is behind the Ferguson 
9 Police Department? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so the console where the dispatcher 
12 would sit, is that inside the Ferguson Police 
13 Department? 
14 A Yes, and it's wired line out to the 
15 transmitter. 
16 Q And is that on a, like a phone line or? 
17 A It is like a phone line. It is not going 
18 through the phone system system's network, but it is 
19 like a pair of Cat 5 or a twisted pair of wires that 
20 are going out to the transmit site. 
21 Q So the dispatcher can communicate via the 
22 transmitter and she can receive, I say she, the one 
23 I'm thinking of is a she, can receive communications 
24 via the receiver?

All right. And you mention portable and 
Right. 
And so explain what a portable radio is? 
A portable radio is what you see on the 
6 officer. It can be held in his hand to transmit, or 
7 a lot of them, a majority of them have what we call 
8 a remote speaker mike, which you'll see right on 
9 their shoulder that they can just key up the radio 
10 and talk and the walkie-talkie or portable radio is 
11 on their hips. 
12 The mobile radio is mounted usually 
13 inside the car and is usually a higher powered type 
14 of road versus portable radio, which is a 5 watt 
15 radio. 
16 Q So I'm going to show you, I haven't marked

1 Q And what would happen if an officer tries 
2 to transmit, for example, on his mobile mike, so the 
3 car radio, while his portable is on and turned up? 
4 A You get a horrible squealing. It is 
5 called acoustic feedback, and it's a horrible 
6 squeal, it's like you're in a room and the 
7 microphones are turned up real high and you get that 
8 squealing noise, that's what the officer gets. And 
9 also at that time that is also being transmitted 
10 back to the dispatcher. So she will sometimes say, 
11 turn your walkie down or turn your walkie off. 
12 Q Again, so we can kind of, the walkie 
13 refers to the portable radio? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Okay. And so can an officer be in his 
16 vehicle and have his mobile radio on a particular 
17 channel, but have his walkie on a different channel? 
18 
19

23 does an officer select a channel on the walkie?

1 Motorola radios, the one on the outside is your on 
2 and off button, and your volume control and then the 
3 center one is your channel selector and it has 
4 little ratchet clicking noise to it. A lot of the 
5 officers know by clicking it two or three times on 
6 what channel they're on.

And that's in the vehicle? 
Right. 
So you said that the ones inside the 
6 vehicle are usually a higher power?

Okay. And so let's talk about the RIOT 
14 channel. You familiar with the RIOT channel? 
15 A Yes, I am. 
16 Q And so can you, what does RIOT stand for, 
17 it doesn't mean it is just for riots? 
18 A Correct. It is Radio Operability, Radio

So what is the purpose of the RIOT 
It is to be used for any type of events

1 municipalities to be able to communicate together in 
2 some type of event. 
3 Q All right. And are you aware of how many 
4 RIOT channels there are in St. Louis County? 
5 A There's a RIOT A, B, C, D and E, so a 
6 total of five. 
7 Q Okay. Now, when a police department 
8 purchases and installs a radio system, are the 
9 channels uniform throughout each municipality or 
10 does each municipal decide what channels they want? 
11 A They mostly decide which one they want. 
12 There is mostly a standard that every radio has at 
13 least RIOT A. Some will put RIOT B in, some won't. 
14 Some will just keep RIOT A their preference. 
15 Q So would it be, for example, I'm just 
16 saying this, for example, like channel one might be 
17 the dispatch channel? 
18 A That's always usually the dispatch 
19 channel. 
20 Q Okay. And then what other kind of 
21 channels are there for the radio? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
There's a mutual aid channel. 
Mutual aid? 
Right, which is once again kind of an 
25 inoperability type of channel, most every radio

1 within the state, mutual aid channel. There's a 
2 point-to-point and that's used for dispatchers to be 
3 able to talk to other dispatch centers. It is 
4 always in that as receive only. The licenses set up 
5 for base station transmission only, no portable 
6 radios can talk on it so they don't interfere with 
7 the radio traffic being transmitted to each of the 
8 different dispatch centers. 
9 Q So if an officer has his radio on the 
10 point-to-point channel, he can hear other 
11 dispatchers that might be talking to each other? 
12 A As long as he's within the range of that 
13 transmitter. 
14 Q Okay. We'll talk about the range in a 
15 second, but that's the purpose of that? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Right. 
They can hear it, but they can't transmit? 
That's correct. 
Okay. And so what about the RIOT channel 
20 now, how does that work. If someone got on the RIOT 
21 channel, who can they talk to? 
22 A Urn, as long as the neighboring 
23 municipality, they have it set up to have some type 
24 of DWI checkpoints or something like that, they 
25 would use it.

1 Q So if, for example, the president or 
2 vice-president was going to visit St. Louis and the 
3 St. Louis County Police Department was going to 
4 provide security for that visit, would they use the 
5 RIOT channel for a period of time? 
6 A Definitely they would secure that channel 
7 for that event. 
8 Q And so if any municipality or anybody that 
9 has these radios can talk on the RIOT channel, how 
10 is it that they know not to use it if, for example, 
11 there is a presidential visit? 
12 A There's pretty much a notice that goes out 
13 through St. Louis County saying between this date 
14 and this date, you know, that's going to be used for 
15 the president coming to town. They even have it set 
16 up for the one golf tournament at one of the country 
17 clubs that they do security with they might secure 
18 that channel for that. 
19 Ballwin Days, they would request the 
20 St. Louis County, we have Ballwin Days going, can we 
21 use the RIOT channel, and they usually approve it 
22 unless there's something, an event that's going to 
23 happen, they will reserve it. 
24 Q It can be used for preplanned events, what 
25 about events that are not preplanned?

1 A That's kind of a go-to if you are on it 
2 using it for an event and something larger comes, 
3 everybody goes to a different channel. 
4 Q So, for example, if there was a hostage 
5 situation that was occurring in South County and the 
6 County Police had mobilized and their attack unit 
7 was on scene and various precincts maybe have been 
8 called in for this situation. Would that be 
9 something they would advise all of those officers to 
10 turn to the RIOT channel? 
11 A Definitely, that is the go-to channel 
12 basically. 
13 Q So the theory is at that time the officers 
14 that are using RIOT channel are all using it for the 
15 same purpose, they all know what's going on, they 
16 are there for that particular event? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q So now, let's talk about, we talked about 
19 when possibly a call could be received and not 
20 received. And you and I met last week and you kind 
21 of had to educate me on a lot of this, but we talked 
22 about the fact that whether or not a call can be 
23 received by somebody might, in part, be determined 
24 by signal strength, correct? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct.

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Q So given that the walkie-talkies? 
A 5 watts. 
1 
2 
3 Q 5 watts. That's a lower signal strength 
4 than the mobile radios in the cars, correct? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q And then how many watts does the 
7 dispatcher has? 
8 A The dispatcher, most of all in St. Louis 
9 County their base stations, their transmitters are 
10 at least 100 watts. 
11 Q Okay. And so there is another thing that 
12 might affect whether or not a transmission is 
13 received is the distance away from the dispatch 
14 transmitter that the radio is, correct? 
15 A Correct. It is kind of a line of sight. 
16 So anything in between this antenna and that 
17 dispatch center can reduce the radio transmission to 
18 that receiver. So if there is a building, even 
19 trees, large thick trees, any steel structure 
20 reduces that capability of that transmitter to get 
21 to that receiver. 
22 Q What about the height of the antenna, does 
23 that also affect the transmission? 
24 A Yes. And especially if a portable radio. 
25 Being on your hip can reduce that 5 watts to almost

1 half if it is touching your body or if this officer 
2 is a large person, that can really cut down the 
3 power. 
4 Q Okay. So would it be uncommon then that 
5 maybe an officer who is using his portable 
6 walkie-talkie could call out and transmit something 
7 and the dispatch not hear him? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, very much so. 
Okay. Also, we talked about the different 
10 powers and strengths of these radios, is it possible 
11 for other officers when they're on say the dispatch 
12 channel, can an officer in car A hear officer in car 
13 B transmitting a call? 
14 A If he's close enough. Only if he's close 
15 enough within, you know, a range. On a portable 
16 radio, it is usually a mile tops, not too much 
17 unless you are out in Kansas, straight line, nothing 
18 there, maybe a mile and a half or so. These are 
19 very low power. He would probably hear the mobile 
20 radio more than he would hear the portable radio. 
21 Q So to understand this, when someone in the 
22 vehicle transmits on the mobile, and let's say they 
23 are going to talk to another car, does that 
24 transmission go from their mobile to the transmitter 
25 tower behind the police station and then go back out

1 to that car? 
2 A No, it is just radio to radio, from mobile 
3 radio to mobile radio. 
4 Q And can you do that, can you talk to other 
5 cars when you are on the dispatch channel? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And when other cars are talking to 
8 each other, can you hear that maybe when you are on 
9 the dispatch channel? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
But I'm gathering that you might not hear 
12 it depending on how far apart you are? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And where the radio might be, correct? 
Correct. 
And so, and we heard some testimony from 
17 another officer who talked about like when he left 
18 his police vehicle and went inside a residence for a 
19 call, he might not hear transmissions that are being 
20 made by dispatch because he's a distance from the 
21 car and he's also on the walkie-talkie inside a 
22 building? 
23 A Right. If he's inside the building, the 
24 mobile wouldn't have any factor on his portable 
25 radio. It is that building structure that is going

1 to reduce the capability of receiving on that 
2 portable. 
3 Q Okay. So it is possibility for a police 
4 officer if he's using his walkie-talkie to transmit 
5 a call, but that call might not be received by local 
6 dispatch? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And that has to do with all of those 
9 factors we've talked about? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, are you aware that when the Ferguson 
12 dispatch receives calls or transmits calls that they 
13 actually record those calls? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q So if the call is not, here is a question 
16 I don't even think I asked you this last week. When 
17 a call is not received by a dispatcher, is there 
18 anyway to tell if that call was ever made? 
19 A No, because that recorder is connected to 
20 the receive portion of the dispatch console. So 
21 whatever the dispatch console receives and hears, 
22 that is when it is recorded. 
23 Q Okay. Is it possible, are there occasions 
24 when a call is received like it is garbled or 
25 there's, you know, static that would make it

1 difficult or impossible to tell what's being said? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Definitely. 
Okay. Now, let's talk about when an 
4 officer is wearing his walkie for the portable radio 
5 if his car is on the dispatch channel, we talked 
6 about if he is in his car he can be on two different 
7 channels, right? 
8 A Right. 
9 Q If his car is on the dispatch channel and 
10 his walkie-talkie gets switched to another channel, 
11 does he get any kind of squelch or anything like 
12 that? 
13 A No. 
14 Q So that could happen, and if that were to 
15 happen and he was unaware of the switch, he would 
16 not know?

24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Right. 
What is that orange button?

1 A When the officer presses that, it sends 
2 out a data burst that is a number that has been 
3 programmed in that radio. So it could be 1, 2, 3, 
4 4, it will send out that data burst. It will be 
5 decoded at the dispatch console and whatever they 
6 decode it as, it could be the officer's name, it 
7 could be the car number, it could be anything, an 
8 alias associated to that radio. It could be even to 
9 that beat, it could be beat 104 that when he hits 
10 that button it will come up on the screen. 
11 Lights flash red and a horrible noise 
12 of beeping goes off until that dispatcher hits the 
13 console a couple times to silence it. 
14 Q And so is there any information that is 
15 transmitted other than what you said that might be 
16 preprogramed to associate that radio is the who that 
17 transmitted that. 
18 Is there anything, can I push that 
19 red button and then say something in there? 
20 A Yes, it also lets you to be able to 
21 transmit. 
22 Q And this data burst that can happen if you 
23 press that orange button, does that depend upon 
24 those factors, like how far away you are, whether 
25 you're in a building or there's buildings between

Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Those are still factors. 
That's also a radio signal? 
Right. 
And it's 5 watts when it comes from there? 
Yes. 
Okay. When an officer is wearing this 
8 type of radio and this is on his sleeve, if he has 
9 it turned to, for example, the dispatch channel, is 
10 this also a speaker? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
So he can hear what's being transmitted? 
Yes. 
Does this have a speaker on it? 
It does, but it is disabled once that 
16 remote speaker mike is connected to the radio. 
17 Q So if you are in your vehicle and your car 
18 vehicle is turning to the dispatch channel and this 
19 is on the dispatch channel, does either of them 
20 cancel each other out? 
21 A No, it is basically which one is turned up 
22 the loudest is which one they are going to hear.

A Yes, definitely. 
November 3, 2014 
Page 161 
2 
3 Q But it would be if you keyed your mike, 
4 that's when you get that squelch? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q So let's talk about what calls that might 
7 walk over each other. That is kind of a phrase that 
8 I used, but is it possible if an officer is 
9 transmitting from this type of a radio, a portable 
10 radio, if someone else on that same channel keys in, 
11 can that person talk over him possibly ? 
12 A Especially if it is on a car radio, it's 
13 possible, but it's really whoever is closest to 
14 Ferguson's transmit site on the dispatch channel. 
15 It is called kind of a receiver capture effect. So 
16 that receiver in that base station, whatever hearing 
17 is the strongest is what's going to be able to be 
18 heard to the dispatcher. 
19 However, if they mix then you get the 
20 garbling sound and you might pick out, you know, 102 
21 or you might pick out a little bit of radio traffic. 
22 And that's when the dispatcher will usually say, car 
23 102, go ahead with your traffic or something like 
24 that, or too many cars calling in they usually state 
25 but yes, it can happen.

1 Q Okay. Now let's talk about transmissions 
2 on the RIOT channel. Do those transmissions when 
3 you are on say RIOT A, if you are on RIOT A on your 
4 radio, does that transmission go to Ferguson? 
5 A No, St. Louis County does a series of 
6 voting receivers and all they are receivers and they 
7 are like ears. And the closest radio is picked up, 
8 that audio is sent down by phone line back to 
9 another box here in Clayton called a comparator. 
10 And that takes the best audio, not the transmission, 
11 but the audio sound from that receiver and votes on 
12 which one's the best, and the best audio, the 
13 strongest audio signal will be heard to the recorder 
14 and to the dispatcher sitting at that console 
15 monitoring the RIOT A channel. 
16 Q So the dispatcher monitoring the RIOT A 
17 channel is here in Clayton, right? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So it is not the Ferguson dispatcher who 
20 is monitoring unless she chooses to do that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And I think we talked about the fact that 
23 a dispatcher has their dispatch channel and then 
24 they have another selected --

2 different channels at once? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And so, so, how many voting? 
Voting receivers. 
How many voting receivers are there in St. 
7 Louis County? 
A Oh, just on the RIOT channel I'm going to 8 
9 take a guess. I don't have their information right 
10 in front of me, but I want to say at least six or 
11 seven. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
14 and west. 
15 Q 
Okay. 
Throughout the county north, south, east 
And so, for example, if something is going 
16 on down in South County, and the county police is 
17 using the RIOT A channel because of this incident 
18 that occurred. If a Ferguson officer calls in on 
19 the RIOT A channel when he's up in Ferguson, is it 
20 possible that his transmission will not be received 
21 by Clayton? 
22 A Yes, especially if the receiver down south 
23 is hearing the transmission louder and it is being 
24 sent in and being voted and voter, that transmission 
25 will be just put on the side basically, won't even

November 3, 2014 
Page 164 
2 Q Will there be any record that that 
3 transmission was made? 
4 A No. 
5 Q So the voting receiver just measures the 
6 strength and quality, audio quality of the call and 
7 then the voting receiver then selects which call 
8 they are going to put through? 
A Right. 9 
10 Q And so is it possible then that somebody 
11 on a walkie-talkie in Ferguson could make a call on 
12 the RIOT A channel, if County Police were using the 
13 RIOT A channel down at South County at the same time 
14 and there were officers talking at the same time, is 
15 it possible then that the Ferguson officer's call 
16 would never get recorded in Clayton? 
17 A Very possible. 
18 Q Is there anything that I haven't asked you 
19 that I forgot about that is important? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
No. 
And just again if you all want to look at 
22 this, I will tell you that this is a radio from the 
23 Ferguson Police Department. It is not Officer 
24 Wilson's radio, but they have the same radios and

9 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Well, it is just kind of 
10 unnerving, I guess, so you are saying, maybe you 
11 didn't say common, but how common is it for dispatch 
12 not to receive calls? 
13 A Urn, it just depends on the radio traffic. 
14 If it is really busy, a really busy day at that 
15 municipality it can happen. You know, one thing, I 
16 hope I'm not telling any secrets, one issue is one 
17 of the county channels which is dispatched in West 
18 County, they have Eureka, they have Chesterfield. 
19 They are so far away that Eureka officer could be 
20 keying up trying to talk to a dispatch and that 
21 Chesterfield officer, which is a little bit closer 
22 to the receiving site, is going to get to Clayton 
23 more and this guy is saying, hey, I need help or 
24 something, that Eureka officer, there is a good

14 out. It doesn't care if there's radio traffic on 
15 it, it keeps on trying until it gets an 
16 acknowledgment from the dispatcher. 
17 Q And as I understand, you can be on, I 
18 guess RIOT A, which is the county? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that orange button wouldn't have any, 
21 would it work for county or would it just go to, if 
22 you are on the RIOT A channel. 
23 A Right. 
24 Q And you are a Ferguson officer and if you 
25 hit that a orange button, what would happen?

1 A It would go to dispatch. It is programmed 
2 as a revert, so when you hit that button, if you are

To Ferguson's dispatch? 
Yes. 
So even though RIOT A channel, it wouldn't

Right. 
But Ferguson would? 
Right. 
And is it your understanding that most 
14 officers are trained if you are in an emergency 
15 situation to hit that orange button? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Q So if I'm in a shooting or something that 
18 would probably be one of the first things a trained 
19 officer would do is to hit that orange button? 
20 A I can't tell you what that officer would 
21 be thinking at that time, but that is kind of, I 
22 need help, that's what I hit. 
23 Q That's the purpose of that orange button 
24 is to supersede everything to let your dispatch know 
25 that you need help?

3 On that point, 
4 tell us again when you would use that emergency 
5 button, or maybe frequency which is used. I gather 
6 this person on dispatch, would you see that happen 
7 once a week, once a day? 
8 A No, very seldom, and only when it's a life 
9 threatening is my understanding is when they hit 
10 that red button. 
11 Gotcha. And that just 
12 signifies to dispatch that dispatch needs to contact 
13 that officer as soon as possible 
14 
15 
16 
A Or get help to them. 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Does that signal go out to 
17 the other cars? 
18 A What they will hear is just a data burst 
19 of static basically is the best way to put it. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: So, but only the dispatch 
21 would show what radio that was coming from. 
22 
23 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So would it require then a 
24 dispatch to communicate with that radio, like 105, 
25 do you need help, what's going on?

2 MS. ALIZADEH: Or to put out a call to 
3 other cars, 105 is in an emergency situation and 
4 possibly give a location, right? 
5 A Whatever their standard of their procedure 
6 is, could be both. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Because most departments, I 
8 know you can't speak to all of the departments, it 
9 sounds like you are implying that most departments 
10 have some kind of procedure regarding how to use 
11 that orange emergency button? 
A Correct. 12 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: It is put there for a 
14 reason, right? 
15 A Yes. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: And the reason is for 
17 emergency situations? 
18 A Yes. 
19 So the channel, 
20 the radio channel has nothing to do with the orange 
21 button, it doesn't have to be on a certain channel? 
22 A That's correct. That radio when I 
23 programmed it, it is called revert and it reverts to 
24 the dispatch channel. 
25 Is it common

1 for police officers to keep their mobile and their 
2 portable on a different channel? 
3 A Usually, it is. 
4 Usually they do. Okay. 
5 So they would have to know that they are on a 
6 different, their portable is on a different channel 
7 when they get out of the car and switch it back? 
8 A Some might just use it to listen to the 
9 neighboring municipal next to them, that is what 
10 they use it mainly, what they tell me. They like to 
11 hear what's going on around them. Maybe Ballwin 
12 would listen in on Manchester PD is doing in case 
13 they need an assistance or something. 
14 They do keep it on 
15 different channels while they are in the car? 
16 A Yeah. And some keep it turned off too to 
17 save the battery and save avoidance of feedback 
18 sometimes. 
19 Can the 
20 dispatcher ever notify a police officer that they 
21 are on the wrong channel? Like they think they are 
22 on their department channel, but for some reason 
23 they are always on it or have a signal? 
24 A No, there is nothing the dispatcher can 
25 see on what channel that that portable or mobile is

1 on. The only way if they are calling them, they 
2 know that they're not on the dispatch channel. If 
3 they are trying to call dispatch and they're not 
4 responding, yes. They will call them by cell phone 
5 or keep on calling, but there is no way that 
6 dispatcher knows. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: I had a question 
8 So there is no readings 
9 that goes out daily from all whatever happened that 
10 day? Like there is a computer generating all the 
11 radios from that day for each department, police 
12 department in the areas, different areas. There is 
13 no generated report that's coming out? 
14 A No, not from which channel their on. The 
15 only thing I've seen where it counts how many times 
16 the radio has been keyed up. It might say it's been 
17 keyed up on this channel ten times that day, that's 
18 about it. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: On the mobile, I'm sorry, 
20 that's passed around, I'm sorry, the portable, thank 
21 you. The orange button is on there, is there also a 
22 an orange button on the mobile that's inside the

A Yes. 
November 3, 2014 
Page 172

3 MS. WHIRLEY: Because I was going to ask 
4 you, what can an officer do if he's in trouble if he 
5 may not be heard on the transmitter, but that's what 
6 he can do? 
7 A Right. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
9 Is there any 
10 other way for dispatch to communicate with the 
11 officer, like through texting to display or texting 
12 to the laptop. 
13 A There is some messaging on their CAD 
14 system, their in-car computer system. I know that 
15 exist, I can't tell you that Ferguson has that 
16 feature, but most of the agencies within St. Louis 
17 County does have a way, and they can communicate car 
18 to car also, so that officer can send a message to 
19 the neighboring precinct or jurisdiction, how am I 
20 going to say this, to the officer next to them. 
21 Would be the officers within that agency. 
22 You talked about 
23 red button emergency situation, that's a pretty 
24 broad for a police officer to cover, obviously, 
25 every emergency situation is going to require a red

1 button. You kind of mentioned a life and death 
2 situation, seems like that button is pretty much 
3 reserved for an extremely serious emergency, not 
4 typical emergency for a police officer? 
A Correct. 5 
6 And that can happen very 
7 quickly. The odds of a police officer to get to 
8 that button in the time of a quickly escalating 
9 activity, that could be a question? 
10 A Right. 
11 It would be hard to hit 
12 that button in a very highly emergency situation 
13 that happens very quickly? 
14 A Right. And if you notice the size of that 
15 button, you really got to hunt for it sometimes. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And just on another note, 
17 for example, the situation is over, then there would 
18 be no reason necessarily for the officer to use the 
19 orange button as opposed to using his walkie-talkie 
20 because then he can explain the nature of his need 
21 for help, correct? 
22 A Correct. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: And if he's transmitting, 
24 if you're transmitting from your walkie-talkie and 
25 it's not being received, other than nobody responds,

1 is there any way that the officer knows that his 
2 transmission didn't get received? 
3 A None whatsoever. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: I send an email and it 
5 doesn't get received, I get something back saying it 
6 wasn't delivered? 
7 A Correct. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: But there's nothing on the 
9 radio like that. 
10 A No. Some departments train they officers 
11 if they don't get out, take radio out of their 
12 holster and transmit, but I couldn't tell you about, 
13 but that is part of a SOP in a lot of departments. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And SOP is standard 
15 operating procedure? 
16 A Yes. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: And tell us again what does 
18 CAD stands for, the CAD?

MS. WHIRLEY: Who puts that information in 
2 there, I know it is computer generated, correct, 
3 tell me about that? 
4 A Well --
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me back up here. Do 
6 you have expertise to talk about the CAD system? 
7 A I know the mechanics, the technology, you 
8 know, how they receive the timing, but as far as it 
9 is all software and every department has got a 
10 different type of CAD. So I couldn't tell you 
11 exactly what information goes in it or how the 
12 screen is. How most of them are set up for timing. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: That's what I want to know 
14 about. 
15 A So a lot of departments bought what they 
16 call Net Clocks. They are little boxes that are 
17 connected to a GPS antenna and they get their timing 
18 from the satellites, just like our car GPS works. 
19 There is also timing that is done and this box kind 
20 of distributes that timing mechanism, which can go 
21 to logging reporters, their CAD, some departments I 
22 set up their consoles have this timing. So that all 
23 the timing is the same throughout. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So when an officer 
25 calls in, let's say I'm on a traffic stop or I'm out

1 with a pedestrian, would that information be timed 
2 into the dispatch or to this CAD system? 
3 A I can't answer that. I don't know. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
5 A I have been listening to police calls 
6 since I was eight years old. Most of the time, the 
7 dispatcher, the officer will call in, I'm at a 
8 traffic stop blah, blah, blah. She will usually 
9 repeat, car 104 is at a traffic stop at 1520 hours, 
10 or something like that. And that's usually the time 
11 the officer will write down that time and that is 
12 what's recorded in the CAD so all the times are 
13 together. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: , you didn't set 
16 up the CAD system in Ferguson, correct? 
17 A I did not. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: And you don't know how they 
19 have it set up? 
20 
21 
A That's correct, I do not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So is it possible that the 
22 time for their CAD calls might differ from the time 
23 that dispatch calls? 
24 A

FAX 314-241-6750 
Definitely.

1 as opposed to getting those times from the 
2 satellite, is it possible then that those times 
3 could be off? 
4 A Yes, definitely. I know I did not sell 
5 them a Net Clock or any type of timing mechanism. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: What about compare it also 
7 to, for example, county communications. Is it 
8 possible that Ferguson's CAD calls and their 
9 dispatch calls might not be timed, the CAD's might 
10 not be the same with the county communication clock? 
A Definitely. 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So a call that we all know 
13 for a fact that was made at 3:00 in the afternoon. 
14 The dispatch time might be 3:02, the CAD call might 
15 say 3:01 and yet the county communication, if it 
16 were received there, might say it was 3:00? 
17 A Yes, definitely. 
18 
19 
20 
MS. ALIZADEH: Be it is just one call? 
A Yes. 
I just 
21 want to make sure I understood you. The

6 So if an officer had his 
7 portable on that channel while he is in the car, 
8 left the car, he thought he was calling in, nobody 
9 would hear him --
10 A That's correct. 
11 until he changed the 
12 channel? 
13 A Right. What he is going to hear is maybe 
14 a bong because that is a receive channel only. 
15 That would be the same, 
16 not that nobody would hear him, but dispatch would 
17 hear him if he was on a RIOT channel, he is on the 
18 mutual aid channel or any of the other channels, he 
19 would have to it put it on one, which is a dispatch 
20 channel for his dispatch to hear him?

5 It is 3:28 on November 3rd. This is Kathi 
6 Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, also all 12 
7 grand jurors are present and , the court 
8 reporter. And we just had a discussion off the 
9 record that we talked about that a witness that I 
10 had scheduled for this afternoon didn't show up, so 
11 we are kind of out of material for today. 
12 And so you all agree to go ahead and

14 about additional things that you all want. It is my 
15 understanding that we're going to get a Ferguson 
16 police vehicle that is not the same vehicle, but the 
17 same make, model and year. So we have to set up 
18 when we are going to do that. 
19 There's been a request to get the press

21 request to get, I will get you copies of the

3 And then I'm also going to contact Chief 
4 to see if he can appear to answer any 
5 questions that you may have that might arise out of 
6 your viewing of the press conferences. And is there 
7 anything else? Oh, yes, you talked about getting a 
8 field training officer. So I will talk to Ferguson 
9 about that. 
10 I think we discussed the fact that it's 
11 Darren Wilson's field training officer in Ferguson 
12 is currently and so probably we 
13 would want to find somebody else who could talk 
14 about the training that they do for their officers 
15 in general. 
16 Would obviously not be that he received, 
17 but in general. Is that all we can think of for 
18 now?
