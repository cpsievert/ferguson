GRAND JURY HEARING 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning, everyone. 
3 This is September 16th, 2014, it is about 8:35 a.m. 
4 This is Kathi Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office, 
5 Sheila Whirley is present, as well as all 12 grand 
6 jurors, and the court reporter is present taking 
7 down and recording what is being said. 
8 Some housekeeping notes to start. I'm 
9 going to pass out to you all, you all are going to 
10 receive a copy of a statute. It is section 563.046, 
11 and it is, it says law enforcement officers use of 
12 force in making an arrest. And it is the law on 
13 what is permissible, what force is permissible and 
14 when in making an arrest by a police officer. 
15 I also want to point out to you, I know 
16 you have probably heard or know that there also is a 
17 joint federal investigation that's going on at the 
18 same time. 
19 And several of our witnesses that you are 
20 going to hear from are also being interviewed by FBI 
21 agents or federal agents. And I want you to make 
22 sure you understand the issues that are before you, 
23 may be different than the issues in any federal 
24 investigation. 
25 Their investigation involves civil rights

1 violations. This investigation involves whether 
2 there is criminal liability on the part of the 
3 officer involved in the shooting. 
4 So I can't tell you what the law is on the 
5 civil rights issues, but don't be confused about, 
6 you know, for example, what are the policies of the 
7 police department necessarily doesn't have anything 
8 to do with your decision. You certainly have the 
9 right to know these things if you wish to know these 
10 things, but keep in mind that there is a separate 
11 and distinct investigation going on by the feds 
12 involving civil rights violation or potential civil 
13 rights violation. 
14 The other thing is, I messed up. I'm not 
15 perfect. Sheila will tell you that I'm not, but 
16 we've been marking our exhibits and normally when I 
17 have a trial I have all of my exhibits beforehand 
18 and I mark them all beforehand and I try to be very 
19 meticulous about my numbers. I have kind of been 
20 marking these as I go. This has all been coming in 
21 as we go, so I screwed up on the numbers. So I just 
22 want to clarify for the record in case you are 
23 keeping track of numbers. 
24 Apparently I have two Grand Jury Exhibits 
25 10.

photographs, 
2 he's the crime scene detective that went to the 
3 hospital and photographed Darren Wilson and the 
4 other one is a disc that I played for you that had 
5 Dorian Johnson's recorded statement. 
6 I'm going to keep photograph as 
7 being Number 10 and I am now going to make that disc 
8 of statements, it is going to be Number 17. 
9 And then apparently I have two Number 9s. 
10 One Number 9, I don't know that I have used with you 
11 all yet. I have marked it, and it is a set of 
12 printed photographs that were taken by the morgue 
13 personnel, not the autopsy photos that we saw during 
14 Dr. testimony. These were separate 
15 photos that were taken by the employees at the 
16 Medical Examiner's Office in the morgue that are 
17 different than the autopsy photos. And those are 
18 going to remain Number 9. 
19 The other Number 9 I have was a disc that 
20 had the news clips on it that we showed where Dorian 
21 Johnson had been interviewed or made certain 
22 statements on television programs. And so that disc 
23 is now going to be Number 16. 
24 Unless you all see another issue or 
25 problem, I think right now we have 1 through 17.

1 You might not have seen all of those, but as far as 
2 I know I don't have any duplicates other than that. 
3 So I'll try to be a little more organized 
4 in numbering of the exhibits. 
5 Does anybody see any other issues with 
6 duplicate numbers? 
7 Okay. And then as we told you at the 
8 beginning of every day, we are just going to kind of 
9 give you a preview of what we are going to do. And 
10 so first we're going to listen to a recorded 
11 statement. The person being interviewed is a 
12 sergeant with the Ferguson Police Department, his 
13 name is He was the sergeant on duty 
14 on the date of the shooting and he was Darren 
15 Wilson's direct supervisor. 
16 You will hear his statement. It is about 
17 an hour long. And then following his statement, 
18 Sergeant will be here to testify. 
19 
20 
After that, we will present the testimony 
of Detective , who is a St. Louis County 
21 police detective, regarding an interview that he did 
22 of Darren Wilson. 
23 And then we are going to present the 
24 testimony of

1 And she is an FBI agent and she also 
2 did an interview of Darren Wilson. 
3 Then we will also present a recorded 
4 interview of Darren Wilson for you to listen, that's 
5 about 30 minutes. 
6 And then finally, I anticipate that the 
7 afternoon will have Darren Wilson testifying for you 
8 this afternoon. 
9 The morning is basically going to be 
10 statements that he has made during this 
11 investigation from various people and then he will 
12 be here to testify and answer your questions in the 
13 afternoon, all right? 
14 So with that being said, the next piece of 
15 evidence is a disc that I have marked as Grand Jury 
16 Number 18. 
17 (Deposition Exhibit Number 18 
18 marked for identification.) 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: One of the things that I 
20 will tell you that these discs that contain 
21 statements of various individuals, I mean, you will 
22 hear me use these discs repeatedly because one disc 
23 might have 12 witnesses statements on it. I will 
24 make sure I preface before we begin to play it whose 
25 statement it is.

1 When you put the disc in the computer and 
2 open up the file, it lists the names of everybody 
3 who has made a statement on that disc. They are 
4 pretty recognizable if you would have any need to 
5 listen to a particular statement, it would be easy 
6 to do that. 
7 But there are a number of witness 
8 statements on each of these discs, that's the way we 
9 received them. 
10 Also, we do not have a transcript of this 
11 first statement. I've listened to it and it is 
12 fairly clear. I don't think it should be an issue, 
13 but at any time you all can't hear it or want us to 
14 go back a couple of seconds or 30 seconds or a 
15 minute if you miss something, that's easy enough to 
16 do, all right? 
17 We are going to play for you Grand Juror 
18 Number 18 and it is the recorded statement of 
19 Sergeant 
20 (Statement is being played.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: And as always 21

And, again, this was Disc Number 18 that 
you heard a recorded statement of It 
24 will be available for you to listen to again at this 
25 time during your investigation.

1 dinner, does everybody that's carrying a 
2 walkie-talkie hear that then? 
3 A Not necessarily. 
Q Do you know why that is? 4 
5 A Well, the walkie-talkies are only 5 watt 
6 transmission power. If they are out in the far 
7 sector or far enough away from a receiver, not 
8 everybody will hear it. Dispatch will hear it 
9 because the receivers will transfer that message to 
10 them, but not necessarily broadcast it out through 
11 the entire area.

13 today that there was an incident that occurred at

16 about that, correct?

21 responding to the Ferguson Market?

1 actually have heard? 
2 A It could have been because I was tied up 
3 with another situation that I was trying to deal

5 Q And so is it, and we've all kind of seen

7 have the volume turned up on your mobile

Are there times when you might be 
12 interacting with somebody or in a situation where 
13 you turn that volume down so that that noise doesn't 
14 interrupt what you are doing? 
15 A Yes, ma'am. Usually when I'm on the 
16 telephone or I'm trying to get control of a 
17 situation, I may turn the volume down so that they 
18 can hear just me speaking. 
19 Q Okay. But at any rate, you didn't hear 
20 the call that came out if the call came out that 
21 there was something going on or taken place at the 
22 Ferguson Market, is that fair to say? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And then while you were on this call, you 
25 did receive a call to respond to the Canfield Green

10 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And so when you got that call, was there a

Yes, ma'am. 
And about how long, how far away were you, 
4 like how many minutes did it take you to get there? 
5 A It took me probably about two, two and a 
6 half minutes. I mean, travel time, not travel time,

A Yes, ma'am. 
Q And when you got to that location, you've 
been patrolling the street of Ferguson for 38 years, 
is that fair to say? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q Very familiar with all the streets and how 
to get around? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q When you arrived at that location, did you 
19 come in off of West Florissant down Canfield or did

1 Q So when you were going down Canfield, at 
2 that point you are going east on Canfield?

Were you in a marked police vehicle? 
Yes, ma'am, I was. 
Did you go to the scene with emergency 
11 lights and sirens on? 
12 A I don't recall. I believe the traffic was 
13 relatively sparse at that time, I don't believe it 
14 was needed. 
15 Q Okay. So when you arrived at the scene, 
16 did you see Mr. Darren Wilson's vehicle? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am, I did. 
Did you notice any other vehicles, whether 
19 it be police officer vehicles or other just civilian 
20 vehicles? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I saw two other police vehicles. 
All right. I guess for, as far as the 
23 police vehicles in Ferguson, we know that Officer 
24 Wilson had a Tahoe? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.

And did you also have a Tahoe?

Are all the police vehicles in Ferguson 
Primarily the entire fleet are Tahoes, but 
6 we also have a secondary fleet of Crown Victorias. 
7 Q So the two police vehicles that you saw 
8 there, besides Officer Wilson, which we've seen 
9 pictures of, were those also marked Tahoes? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So when you got there, you notice Officer 
12 Wilson's vehicle, which direction was it facing in 
13 the street? 
14 A It was kind of catty-corner to the, or 
15 angular to the traffic lane, but it was pointing

1 Canfield? 
2 A Yes, ma'am, they both were on Canfield. 
3 Both of them were further east than Officer Wilson's 
4 location. 
5 Q And when you arrived at that location, did 
6 you see a body? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And was that, where was that body or where 
9 were those two police vehicles in relation to the 
10 body? 
11 A One police vehicle was beyond the location 
12 of the body parked across the traffic lane to 
13 prevent any vehicle from coming that direction and 
14 the second car was parked off to the right side of 
15 the roadway. 
16 Q So the vehicle that was, I guess, 
17 perpendicular to the street, that would have been 
18 farther east of the body; is that right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And the entire time from the time you got 
21 there until the scene was cleared, did you ever 
22 observe Officer Wilson's vehicle move or be moved, 
23 other than when it was towed away?

Q 
No, ma'am.

14 A I believe they were in a position to 
15 protect the area where the body was located. 
16 Q Now at this time, and I know you don't 
17 know when everybody else got there, we know that two 
18 officers, obviously, responded prior to your 
19 arrival; is that right?

A No, ma'am, not at that time. 2 
3 Q And at that point, were there any cones in 
4 the street or around the area? 
5 A One of the officers had placed a few cones 
6 around to indicate location of possible evidence, 
7 but not all the cones had been placed out yet. 
8 Q Okay. And I asked you if you noticed were 
9 there any civilian vehicles, I know it is an 
10 apartment complex and there is parking lots, but I'm 
11 talking about in the street itself. Were there any 
12 civilian vehicles that were stopped in the street 
13 when you arrived? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Did you notice any pedestrians, civilians 
16 that were on foot in the area? 
17 A There were several pedestrians about the 
18 area. 
19 Q When you say several, when you first 
20 arrived, give me an idea how many you think, an 
21 estimate how many you would say at the scene? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
I'd say 10 to 15. 
Okay. Now, we've heard that there was 
24 obviously a larger crowd that gathered during the 
25 day and that there was some unstableness in the

1 crowd, but at this point, were those 10 to 15 
2 people, were they interfering at all, were they 
3 creating a disturbance? 
4 A They were making some noise regarding who 
5 the body was and it was at that point in time that I 
6 grabbed some crime scene tape out of my police 
7 vehicle, gave it to the two officers that were 
8 already there and told them to start setting up a 
9 perimeter to keep people back. 
10 Q And so at this point it is fair to say 
11 that you didn't know whose body was in the street, 
12 correct? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And none of the other officers at this 
15 point had identified who was in the street, correct? 
16 A To the best of my knowledge, that's 
17 correct. 
18 Q And then other people that were gathering 
19 in the area, people were wondering who it was 
20 because maybe it was someone they knew or a loved 
21 one of their's, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So there was some agitation or stress 
24 involved with people that were there, they were 
25 concerned about who that was?

2 Q When you arrived, was the body of Michael 
3 Brown covered? 
A No, ma'am. 4

6 any medical personnel, EMS?

8 did.

Q And did the fire department also show up? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q And is that typical that when EMS is

13 to the call? 
14 A It actually depends on the call. If it is 
15 a more critical call, such as a life threat, a heart 
16 attack, difficulty breathing, yes, they would 
17 respond with the EMS personnel. 
18 Q So it is not unusual that on this type of

1 around the crime scene? 
2 A The two police officers did, no other fire 
3 personnel or ambulance personnel. 
4 Q Now, at this point is Darren Wilson still 
5 in the vehicle? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q Did he get out of the car when you got 
8 there? 
9 A The only time he got out of the car is 
10 when I told him to get into my vehicle and leave the 
11 scene. 
12 Q Okay. So he stayed in his own car until 
13 you told him to take your car and go back to 
14 Ferguson Police Department? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
So going back now, we kind of got the 
17 scene what it looked like when you first got there, 
18 what's the first thing you did when you drove down 
19 the street and saw Darren Wilson's car facing you in 
20 the street the way it was? 
21 A I pulled off onto a driveway apron, right 
22 off the street, parked my car and then I walked over 
23 to speak with Officer Wilson. 
24 Q So contacting Officer Wilson was the first 
25 thing you did?

Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And what did you say to Officer Wilson? 
I initially asked him what had happened. 
Now, you and I talked yesterday about your 
8 recollection of Officer Wilson's statement. And we 
9 talked about the fact that sometimes when you are 
10 recounting a statement, you kind of like use your 
11 own words to paraphrase? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
We also talked about that police officers 
14 have what we call like cop talk, where you use 
15 phrases and words that are typical in police lingo 
16 or vernacular, wouldn't that be fair to say? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Oh, yes, ma'am. 
And remember and recall that yesterday 
19 when you and I talked about this, it is important 
20 for today that you as best you can use Darren 
21 Wilson's words, don't try to paraphrase, don't try 
22 to put your spin on things. And I know I don't mean 
23 that you would do that intentionally, but if he 
24 didn't say that it was, you know, forceful or if he 
25 didn't use the words, try not to use your own words,

9 I asked him why? 
10 He said he had been walking in the 
11 street, I told him to get off the sidewalk, or get 
12 on the sidewalk. 
13 I said okay. 
14 He said well, they told me to fuck 
15 off. I slowed my car down, or he slowed his car 
16 down and I told him, hey, all you got to do is get 
17 out of the street and get on the sidewalk.

2 up to the side of his car and started hitting on him 
3 through the window. 
4 I said hitting you? 
5 He goes, yeah, he reached in, he hit me on 
6 the side of my face several times, and grabbed at my 
7 shirt, grabbed at my hands and arms. 
8 He said I was trying to get out of the 
9 vehicle and he wouldn't let me out, he kept pushing 
10 the door closed. 
11 The individual reached in and was trying 
12 to grab at his pistol, his pistol came out of his 
13 holster. He told me he had control of the weapon, 
14 but it was being pointed at him. He had the gun in 
15 his hand, but the muzzle of the weapon had been 
16 turned where his hand was actually turned toward 
17 him. 
18 And he said he was still getting hit 
19 with one hand at times and there was a struggle over 
20 the gun. He said the weapon was, he didn't get 
21 control of the weapon, but he was able to turn the 
22 weapon away from himself and the firearm discharged. 
23 He said the gun went off. 
24 Q Is that how he described it, the gun went 
25 off?

10 dimple in the sheet metal. 
11 I said what happened then?

22 
23 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
You have a unique perspective that 
24 probably none of the other witnesses who are going 
25 to testify in this investigation have. When you are

1 involved in that type of critical scene, what is 
2 your focus and what's your training tell you to 
3 focus on? 
4 A You focus on your target. I'm sorry, not 
5 target, but you focus on whose angry at you, whose 
6 coming at you or whose trying to harm you. 
7 Q So would it be fair to say that you focus 
8 on the threat? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And is it unusual or typical, I guess, 
11 that you kind of lose focus of other things that 
12 might be going on around you? 
13 A No, it is not unusual. You get kind of 
14 like tunnel vision. You only see, like you said, 
15 the threat. 
16 Q All right. And so let me ask you this. 
17 When Darren Wilson told you about, for example, he 
18 said that there were two men walking in the street 
19 and he told them to get on the sidewalk, did he tell 
20 you whatever became or happened to that other 
21 individual? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Did you see, we now know Michael Brown was 
24 shot dead in the street, did you see the other 
25 individual at the scene who might have been the

1 individual that Officer Wilson saw walking with 
2 Michael Brown? 
3 A No, ma'am. 
4 Q Now, understanding how important this 
5 initial statement might be, is there a reason why 
6 you did not record his statement? 
7 A Number one, I did not have a recorder. 
8 Number two, I didn't take notes because at that 
9 point in time I had multiple things going through my 
10 mind besides what Darren was telling me. 
11 Q You've already said that before arriving 
12 at the scene you didn't even know that this was a 
13 shooting, would that be fair to say? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
You didn't hear other radio traffic from 
16 other officers saying that there had been a 
17 shooting? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
So describe for the jurors how Darren 
20 Wilson appeared to you, his demeanor, first of all? 
21 A He appeared in a state of shock. He was 
22 staring at the dashboard of his vehicle initially. 
23 It was only after maybe a couple of questions that 
24 he finally looked at me. I could see the side of 
25 his face, especially around his mouth starting to

his left eye, see a mouse starting to grow. 
His uniform shirt was disheveled, 
pulled out of his waistband. 
Did you notice any blood on him? 
No, ma'am, I did not notice any blood on 
Did you ask him if he was shot or injured? 
Yes, I did. 
10 What did he say? Q 
A 11 He said the only thing that he knew of was 
12 his face from being hit several times. 
13 Q And you didn't see anything on him to 
14 indicate that he was bleeding? 
A No, ma'am. 15

17 of circling back now.

Q 
That's okay. 
He's told you that he pursued Michael 
20 Brown and Michael Brown stopped and turned in his 
21 direction and charged him. I'm just kind of 
22 catching up. So I know it was in a little more 
23 detail and then he shot him and Michael Brown went 
24 down on the street? 
25 A Correct.

Brown? 
No, ma'am, it did not. 
Did you assist in getting other sheets to 
Yes, I asked a paramedic if he had another 
18 sheet so I could fully cover Mr. Brown up, and 
19 actually he handed me two. 
20 Q Did you observe the paramedics approach 
21 the body and attend to the body of Mr. Brown? 
22 A I saw one approach the body, bent down and 
23 I guess checked for life signs. He got up maybe 10, 
24 15 seconds and just walked away. 
25 Q Do you know what a strip is?

What is a strip?

Did he do that in this case? 
They did not. 
And other than that paramedic who had 
13 checked for life signs presumably, did you see 
14 anyone else, either law enforcement or any other 
15 civilians get close to the body? 
16 A There was a, I believe it was a copper 
17 projectile about 3 feet from his foot, his right 
18 foot and somebody walked over there and put a marker 
19 to make sure nobody kicked it or disturbed its 
20 location.

22 anyone move the body, roll him over, reconfigure the

1 statement that you were at the scene until the scene 
2 was done, which would have been after 5:00? 
3 A It was closer to 6:15, 6:30, yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And now you are aware then that the body 
5 of Michael Brown lay in the street under that sheet 
6 for several hours on that day; is that right?

8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Is that, do you know the reason for that? 
After I made notification to command 
10 staff, I was recontacted and advised that St. Louis 
11 County would be handling the investigation and the 
12 crime scene and I had to await their arrival. Once 
13 they arrived, the crime scene was relinquished to 
14 them. 
15 Q And then any decision about what would 
16 happen with the body, that wasn't your decision or 
17 anything you had to do with, is that fair to say? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Were you the most senior ranking Ferguson 
20 police officer at the scene that day? 
21 A Uh, I had two lieutenants show up later on 
22 shortly after, maybe around 1:00 or so. 
23 Q Now, you testified that you made 
24 notification, who is the first person you called? 
25 A Chief of Police.

20 was, where I found it and told him to take my car 
21 and go back to the station and wait for a

14 Q 
Okay. 
That's when he was more, a little bit more 
More detailed. Did he talk about anything 
15 about the stealing that occurred at Ferguson Market 
16 that he was stopping these two to investigate that? 
17 A He said he did not have that call, that 
18 call I later found out was given to Officer 
19 
20 Q Did he know about it, did he talk about 
21 knowing about the stealing? 
22 A He did not know anything about the 
23 stealing call. 
24 Q He told you he did not know anything about 
25 the stealing?

1 A He did not know anything. He was out on 
2 another call in the apartment complex adjacent to 
3 Canfield Green. 
4 Q Okay. And so when he's stopping these two 
5 it is strictly about the sidewalk, it has nothing to 
6 do with him investigating the stealing of 
7 Cigarillos; is that correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Did he indicate that he was angered at all 
10 when he was told to fuck off? 
11 A Well, no police officer likes being told 
12 that. I don't think he was angered as much as he 
13 was just taken aback by it for no reason whatsoever. 
14 Q Is that like a sign of disrespect, I would 
15 feel disrespected if somebody told me to fuck off? 
16 A You know, respect toward the police 
17 nowadays is not like it used to be. Most of the 
18 time it is under their breath or just barely within 
19 earshot, but evidently at this point in time it was 
20 told quite directly at him. 
21 Q Okay. Did Wilson indicate, Officer Wilson 
22 indicate that when he chased Michael Brown, that 
23 assistance had been called for at that point? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
He did not indicate to me, no, ma'am.

Okay. Now, have you ever known Officer

7 A Not to my knowledge, other than on the 
8 practice range or the firing range at the police 
9 department, that's the only time I know he's ever 
10 discharged a weapon. 
11 Q Have you ever known him to get into a 
12 physical altercation with a suspect?

2 My 
3 question is, did Officer Wilson, did he state 
4 specifically that it was Michael Brown that made 
5 those derogatory or offensive comments to him or did 
6 he indicate if it was Dorian Johnson? 
7 A He did not indicate to me who made the 
8 comments, ma'am.

10 
I see. 
I've got a 
11 couple questions. Did Officer Wilson indicate at 
12 all that he said anything to Michael Brown as he was 
13 chasing after him? 
14 A He yelled at him to stop or halt, but 
15 nothing more than that. 
16 Are those the words he 
17 used stop, halt? 
18 A I don't know, I believe he just told him 
19 to stop. 
20 Okay. Did he indicate at 
21 any point when he, right after he had first contact 
22 with him and told him, asked him to get out of the 
23 street, that at any point he had to reverse his car 
24 back towards them?

4 MS. ALIZADEH: Sergeant I just want 
5 to clarify. I know you know things about what 
6 happened, I want to make sure that we're clear on 
7 this. Are you saying that you know that that 
8 happened because you've since learned that, or are 
9 you saying that Officer Wilson that day told you 
10 that he reversed his vehicle? 
11 A Officer Wilson did not tell me that day 
12 that he had to do that. 
13 
14 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
I've learned that through a later 
15 conversation.

17 things that he says he did, I want to make sure it 
18 is clear to everybody, you know, to clarify whether 
19 or not it is something that he knows happened 
20 because of subsequent investigation or if it is 
21 something that Officer Wilson said to you.

1 did not know about the stealing that was going on or 
2 had just occurred at the Ferguson Market. 
3 Now, my question to you is this, are 
4 you saying that because he told you he didn't know 
5 about it or you saying that because he didn't 
6 mention it to you when you were talking to him? 
7 A He did not mention it to me again. I 
8 learned about it at a later time. 
9 Q Has he ever told you, yeah, I didn't know 
10 anything about what happened up at the Ferguson 
11 Market? 
12 A Yes, he has told me that in subsequent

18 : Just one last follow-up,

1 call to dispatch, which initiated a call to you. 
2 You know, I understand from watching the news when 
3 someone calls 911, the recording is timestamped and 
4 there is an audio recording. In this instance or in 
5 a regular instance, when an officer calls dispatch, 
6 is there any sort of timestamp or recording, or 
7 secondary recording so we would know exactly what 
8 that call would be or when that call took place? 
9 A Yes, all of our incoming calls, including 
10 radio traffic, is recorded digitally. That would be 
11 available to the investigators through our 
12 communications supervisor. 
13 Are you aware of what that 
14 original call would have been when he called? 
A His original call?

15

17 A I have since learned what it was, is that 
18 what you want to hear? 
19 Sure. 
20 A It was a sick case on Glenark was the 
21 street. Again, next apartment complex over is 
22 Northwinds Apartments and Glenark is small, like 
23 eight apartments on that street. He responded to a 
24 sick case at that location.

and 
After the shooting of Michael Brown, was 
call when he dispatched that first call, was 
again recorded that you would have known what 
call would have been for him to call dispatch 
say XYZ happened? 
A Yeah, I believe the answer to that 
8 question would be yes. When he called it into 
9 dispatch, he would have probably told them what was 
10 going on and what happened.

15 real quick.

19 fired, asking for assistance before he gets out of 
20 the car or around the time this is happening?

Q 
No, ma'am. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So it is important that 
11 you testify about your own personal knowledge and 
12 not what maybe somebody has told you that you 
13 believe. Would it be fair to say that you don't 
14 know what those calls consisted of because you have 
15 never heard them, right? 
16 A I don't know what the calls consist of, 
17 that is correct.

19 a call, but you have never heard that yourself? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Whatever those calls would be, they would

23 of this investigation, could that have occurred?

A Yes.

13 he was alone, when he left the scene of the crime, 
14 Officer Wilson, why was he left alone, why didn't 
15 another officer escort him back to the police 
16 department? 
17 A There was another police officer on light 
18 duty at the police department who could sit with 
19 him. 
20 Say that again? 
21 
22 
A There was another officer who, 
station 
23 bound. So there was an officer there who could sit 
24 with him until a supervisor got there.

1 he escorted by another PO considering that even 
2 though he left the scene of the crime, that someone 
3 could have noticed him and followed him, but yet he 
4 wouldn't of had any backup or protection, he still 
5 would have been left alone? 
6 A I had, let's see, Darren made, Darren made 
7 my sixth officer for the day and that includes 
8 myself. 
9 I already had three other officers 
10 and myself at the scene, I had another officer still 
11 out on a call. So I only had one officer that was 
12 left on the street. I honestly, truthfully, I 
13 didn't have the manpower to send somebody with him. 
14 Okay. 
15 A But yes, you are correct, somebody could 
16 have followed him. But also on our radio we have 
17 Country Club Hills and Calverton Park. If there 
18 would have been a problem, there would have been 
19 other officers in the area from those two agencies 
20 that could have responded. 
21 Okay. My next question 
22 was or is, I seen pictures of the car, Officer 
23 Wilson's car. I only seen a little shattered glass 
24 that was on his driver's side seat?

4 A He never told me what the window position

6 Okay. My last question 
7 is, after the incident, the crime was over and you 
8 had time to go back to your office, did you ever 
9 think to read Officer Wilson's history prior to 
10 coming to your department or when he came up under 
11 your leadership to understand his previous history? 
12 A Anything that happened prior to his 
13 employment should have been covered by the officer 
14 who did his background investigation. 
15 Now, I don't know who did his 
16 background investigation preemployment. I did speak 
17 with his supervisor prior to him coming to my squad 
18 and ask what kind of officer he was. And I believe 
19 I was presented with a few training certificates 
20 that he had obtained while he was on the other 
21 squad, but there were no corrective measures or any 
22 disciplinary notes or anything such as that in what 
23 I was given.

14 have a ready backup in case of a situation that

Whose recorded statement? 
Your recorded statement. 
It had to be something I learned after 
13 All right, thank you. 
14 Also to 
15 clarify. I want to make sure when you told Officer 
16 Darren Wilson to get in your vehicle and go back to 
17 the Ferguson Police Department, at that time he was 
18 still currently wearing his uniform he had on at the 
19 time of the incident and his gun was with him when 
20 he went back to Ferguson? 
21 A His sidearm, yes, he carried his side arm 
22 back to Ferguson holstered. 
23 And at that point, I 
24 guess, you were at the scene, you wouldn't have 
25 known what happened to that gun or who would have

MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
MS. WHIRLEY: I just have one. Whose 
8 decision was it to call county in to investigate? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
It was the chief of police's decision. 
(By Ms. Whirley) This is pretty standard 
11 when there is a shooting, you say you have been 
12 involved in a few shootings, do you generally have 
13 another department investigate it or do you 
14 investigate it yourselves? 
15 A One of the previous, or the one, I should 
16 say the two that I investigated, we investigated 
17 them. This one, well, the first two were only, they 
18 were not mortal wounds, they weren't fatalities. 
19 I believe the chief made that 
20 decision because of, it would be better to have an 
21 outside agency such as county or state police to do 
22 the investigation to show that we were not trying to 
23 hide or cover up anything. 
24 
25 Q 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.

1 you've said to me at least before, I can't remember 
2 if you testified today that you don't recall what 
3 time you got up to the scene, the time it was? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But assuming that we know that the 
6 shooting occurred somewhere like a quarter after 
7 noon, give or take a few minutes, but I'm just 
8 trying to use that as a reference, how long was it 
9 before you saw county officers responding up at the 
10 scene? 
11 A Uh, I believe the first one arrived on the 
12 scene anywhere from an hour to an hour 15. 
13 Q So were you privy to the decision to call 
14 county into the investigation, were you talking with 
15 the superiors when that decision was made? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
So whoever made that decision, you don't 
18 know when that decision was made? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
But you were at the scene for about an 
21 hour to an hour and a half you said?

Q

Hour 15, yeah. 
Before you saw county arrive? 
Correct.

18 mentioned before that protocol that all officers

1 want to ask you, is there anything that you think 
2 this grand jury should know about this incident or 
3 that you know that maybe we didn't ask you. I don't 
4 want anybody walking away from here saying well, 
5 they never asked me that or anything like that. Is 
6 there anything that you think would be important for 
7 this grand jury to know that you haven't told them 
8 yet? 
9 A I've worked with Officer Wilson for two 
10 and a half years. He's been under my supervision 
11 that long. 
12 Darren is a very easy going 
13 individual, always has a smile on his face. Doesn't 
14 go trying to start trouble or look for trouble, does 
15 a good job. 
16 I have very little supervisory hours 
17 dedicated to Darren Wilson. He knows his job very 
18 well and he does it very well. 
19 My opinion, put in this 
20 circumstances, I don't know what I would have done. 
21 I probably would have done the same thing. 
22 So, I mean, Darren did not just all 
23 of the sudden go from trying to chase this guy down 
24 and take him into custody to deciding just to shoot 
25 him because. So, I mean, Darren is a good officer.

1 much knowledge as we have at the time. 
2 He had advised me that the medical 
3 examiner had not been notified yet and that's when I 
4 requested them to do so. 
5 Typically the way that it works with 
6 our police department is the personnel from the 
7 division of patrol, which would be the uniform 
8 police officers are responsible for making that 
9 notification. 
10 So once I found out that that wasn't 
11 done, I immediately made that request. 
12 Q So when you arrived, the medical examiner 
13 had not been notified? 
14 A To my knowledge, no. Sergeant 
15 informed me that they had not been. 
16 Q How about EMS, the emergency personnel? 
17 A I was unaware if they had responded yet at 
18 the time. My main concern was making sure the 
19 medical examiner was dispatched. 
20 Q Because when you arrived, it was 
21 determined that Michael Brown was dead? 
22 A Yes. So if subject is deceased, then the 
23 next step would be to contact the medical examiner. 
24 Q Describe the scene when you arrived, you 
25 said it was 1:30-ish or so?

Describe the scene for us? 
As I arrived, I came down West Florissant 
4 and then turned, it would be east on Canfield Road. 
5 The entire street was lined with cars, both civilian 
6 cars and other police cars from St. Louis County. I 
7 believe there was a Ferguson car there and multiple 
8 other jurisdictions, to where I was unable to even 
9 make it to the actual crime scene. I had to park 
10 some distance away, I don't know the exact distance, 
11 but some distance away and walk up to the crime 
12 scene. 
13 Which is a little atypical than what 
14 we're used to. Typically we drive right up to the 
15 crime scene tape, park outside of it and then we can 
16 enter the crime scene there. 
17 There were multiple people, I can't 
18 quantify how many, but people were walking towards 
19 that area as I was walking up as well, and that's 
20 when I entered the crime scene. 
21 Q Could you hear people talking? I don't 
22 want to assume, was there a crowd, are you telling 
23 us, a crowed of people? 
24 A There were, I would say small pockets of 
25 people around the entire crime scene. When you ask

A Correct. 
Q Was it your job to make any contact with

12 happens in an investigation of any kind, is that the 
13 detectives will basically come together and a case 
14 detective will be assigned. 
15 In this case detective 
16 was the case officer. 
17 
18 
Q What does that mean, case officer? 
A He'd be essentially the person that would 
19 orchestrate and dole out assignments and be 
20 responsible for the investigation as a whole. He 
21 would be the one that would be writing the report 
22 and like I said, making the assignments for other 
23 detectives to do. 
24 Q So you were assisting in the 
25 investigation, he was the case agent or officer?

14 almost every investigation. Just to understand what 
15 that person saw and what happened to better assist 
16 us within the scene. 
17 So that's kind of the reason we do 
18 that. 
19 Q Okay. Was it your responsibility to seize 
20 any evidence at the scene? 
21 A No. I was at the scene for maybe ten 
22 minutes and then I was dispatched to Ferguson Police 
23 Department. 
24 Q Because you needed to talk to Darren 
25 Wilson?

Correct. 
So do you go to Ferguson on your own? 
I do. 
By yourself you go to Ferguson, what 
5 happens then? 
6 A Then I enter the Ferguson Police 
7 Department. You enter on the street level and then 
8 I went upstairs to their common area. I did knock 
9 on the door, allowed entry by Lieutenant Colonel 
10 who is a lieutenant colonel with the 
11 Ferguson Police Department. And he escorted me back 
12 to the Ferguson Police Department detective bureau, 
13 which is a room about half the size of this. 
Q Was anyone in that room?

I was then introduced by him to police

16 
17 officer Darren Wilson, an attorney and 
18 Detective

20 Darren Wilson why you were there to talk to him, do 
21 you know what the other folks were there for? 
22 A I assume that had just been working that 
23 day, I never even asked. It didn't seem important 
24 at the time. 
25 Q It wasn't relevant to your investigation

A 
Q 
Correct. 
Did you talk to Darren Wilson in front of 
4 these other people? 
5 A I made basically just an introduction to 
6 Darren Wilson. When I saw him, he was wearing full 
7 uniform which consisted of a Ferguson Police 
8 Department button down shirt and then dark blue 
9 slacks. He then directed my attention to his duty 
10 belt, which was off at the time sitting on the 
11 floor. 
12 Q I'm going to come back to the duty belt. 
13 I want to know you did talk to Darren briefly? 
14 A Very briefly, not about the actual 
15 incident at that time. 
16 Q At that time, so all the people were 
17 allowed to remain or were there with you these other

1 Q Is that uncommon? Have you ever been 
2 involved in an officer involved shooting before? 
3 A I have not been involved in one, but I 
4 have investigated multiple. 
5 Q Okay. That was a better way to answer, I 
6 didn't ask the question right. Because you've never 
7 shot anyone, is what you are telling us? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
But you have been involved investigating 
10 those shootings?

12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is it customary for the person who was 
13 involved, the officer that is involved in the 
14 shooting to handle and package their own gun as 
15 evidence? 
16 A Well, with the St. Louis County Police 
17 Department it is something that's not done, however, 
18 we were called to investigate another police 
19 department's incident. So at that time we were 
20 unaware of any policies or procedures they have in 
21 place that when we get there basically we have to 
22 find out, I guess, and explore the possibility that 
23 maybe that's part of their policy. 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Did you explore that? 
At that time, no, I did not.

Page 90 
So you don't know what their policy is? 
Correct, I do not. I just knew that 
5 police officer Darren Wilson had told me that he had 
6 packaged the weapon and it was currently in that 
7 bag. Now, at that point in time I never checked to 
8 verify that, it was done later. 
9 Q Okay. In an investigation such as this, 
10 ideally what should happen with the officer's gun? 
11 A The way that, I can only speak to the way 
12 St. Louis County would handle it. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
Sure. 
Is that that officer would continue to 
15 have his weapon in his holster until a detective 
16 from the Crimes Against Person Unit, which is my 
17 unit, a supervisor and a crime scene unit detective 
18 would conduct what we call a download of the weapon. 
19 And that's an inspection of the weapon to determine 
20 how many rounds are left inside of the weapon. 
21 So what would happen is we would ask 
22 the officer to remove his weapon from his holster, 
23 the magazine would be ejected, we would count the 
24 number of rounds in the magazine, if there are any. 
25 Then we would ask him to move the slide to the rear,

2 what that means is there would be a round of 
3 ammunition in the barrel of the weapon.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
And then that would be photographed as

Would the gun be returned to the officer? 
No, the weapon would then be seized by our 
9 crime scene unit detective. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Until the investigation? 
Typically what would happen is that it 
12 would go directly to our firearm lab. They do a 
13 test fire, inspect the weapon and then at that point 
14 it would be returned to the police officer. 
15 Q Okay. So you're at the Ferguson station,

A 
Q

How did that come about, if you know?

21 by Lieutenant Colonel 
22 Q When you arrived in Ferguson, were they 
23 discussing that he was going to go to the hospital 
24 or did that come up while you were there?

1 conversation that was taking place before and then 
2 continued as I arrived. 
3 So I heard basically the tail end 
4 that Officer Darren Wilson would go to the hospital 
5 and get treated. 
6 Q And what did that mean as far as your 
7 investigation was concerned? 
8 A The way I would handle it with anybody, 
9 victim, witness, suspect, anybody that we would talk 
10 to is that if they are requesting medical treatment, 
11 we would do that first, that's more important than 
12 any statement we are going to get. And we can 
13 continue the statement at the hospital, which 
14 happens regularly. That we would follow them to the 
15 hospital, meet them at the hospital and then get the 
16 statement there while they're receiving treatment. 
17 We would never hinder anybody from getting medical 
18 treatment if they sought it.

You all arrived at the hospital? 
Yes. 
He's, I imagine, treated? 
Yes. If I can just back up one step. 
Sure. 
Before we had departed, the Ferguson 
12 Police Department, Officer Wilson did remove his 
94 
13 uniform shirt and draped it over a chair, which that 
14 was essentially in Detective right 
15 next to his desk. So that's kind of where the three

5 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
I meant to ask you going back and going to 
6 come right back to the hospital, when you first 
7 encountered him, what was his demeanor? 
8 A He was calm, collected. I didn't see that 
9 there was any type of debilitating injury to where 
10 it would prevent any type of interview, like a head 
11 injury or something like that. He seemed to be 
12 talking, making logical sense and talking like that. 
13 So there was no concern that he had 
14 some major head injury, I guess, from my own opinion 
15 or appearance. 
16 Q He never complained about his head being 
17 injured?

3 He indicated he was. 
4 What was your call sign if you were 
5 to call out on the radio? His call sign was Frank

7 What sector he was assigned to. 
8 Sector 1. 
9 What is the beginning and end times 
10 for his scheduled shift. He indicated he began a 
11 shift at 6:30 in the morning and was scheduled to 
12 end his shift at 6:30 at night. 
13 What he was wearing. He indicated he 
14 was wearing the uniform he currently had on and the 
15 rest of it what he left at the station. And what 
16 vehicle he was assigned that day. He said he was 
17 assigned vehicle 108, which he describes as a fully

20 vehicle is actually a truck?

1 A Basically during the cursory interview, I 
2 asked a very open ended question and allow that 
3 person to just talk. Tell me, from basically start 
4 to finish, what happened. And the only time I will 
5 really interrupt if I need a clarifying question or 
6 something I didn't understand it, I need time 
7 catching up writing down what he's saying. 
8 I just essentially asked Officer 
9 Darren Wilson to describe what happened and where he 
10 was at prior to the incident up through the 
11 incident. 
12 He tells me that he was leaving an 
13 unrelated sick case call and was driving, it would 
14 be west on Canfield Road. As he's driving he hears 
15 a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing 
16 in progress at 9101 West Florissant Avenue, and he 
17 provides us with that address and the nature of the 
18 call was a stealing. 
19 He said that the call comments 
20 indicated the suspect description was a black male 
21 wearing a black shirt and brown shorts, and that an 
22 additional call comment indicated that taken during 
23 the stealing were Cigarillos.

1 driving west down, continues west down Canfield Road 
2 and he sees two subjects approaching from the area 
3 of West Florissant and Canfield walking in the 
4 center of the street. 
5 I then ask Officer Darren Wilson to 
6 describe the two subjects. 
7 He describes one subject as a black 
8 male, dark complexion, approximately 5 foot 5, with 
9 short dreadlock style hair wearing a black T-shirt. 
10 He describes the second male as a black male, medium 
11 complexion, approximately 6 foot 3, approximately 
12 270 pounds, clean shaven, wearing a red baseball 
13 style cap, a gray shirt, khaki shorts and yellow 
14 socks. 
15 Officer Wilson then tells me that as 
16 he's traveling west down Canfield Road, he stops his 
17 patrol vehicle and allows the two subjects to 
18 approach. So basically they're walking towards the 
19 front of his patrol vehicle. 
20 Q Did he indicate whether they were walking 
21 single file or side by side or anything? 
22 A He never did and I didn't ask. He just 
23 says they were walking down the center of the 
24 street.

Okay, go ahead. 
He says right after he makes that

15 our destination." And then it's quickly followed by 
16 the larger male stating, "the fuck with what you 
17 have to say", and he quotes that. And then they 
18 continue to walk past his vehicle, which would be 
19 east on Canfield. 
20 Q At that point does he say that he 
21 investigates these two for stealing Cigarillos, does 
22 he mention anything to them about the theft?

1 tells me that he got on his radio and says that he's 
2 going to be conducting, notifies his dispatcher he 
3 is conducting a pedestrian check and he requests an 
4 assist car. 
5 He then places his vehicle in reverse 
6 and backs up towards the subjects. He places his 
7 car in park, I'm sorry. As he attempts to exit his 
8 vehicle he says, "hey, come here." That's a quote 
9 that he used, "hey, come here." 
10 As he's opening his door he feels the 
11 door get slammed shut and then realizes the larger 
12 of the two subjects pushed his driver's door closed. 
13 He then tells the large subject to 
14 get back and to move, and attempts to open the door 
15 a second time. The door is then forced shut again, 
16 and he describes that the larger subject is standing 
17 at his driver's door with both hands on the door 
18 frame of the vehicle like where the window would 
19 come up is how he describes it. 
20 And then Officer Wilson orders the 
21 subject, or the subject to get back again. And 
22 those are his words, get back and move is what the 
23 two words that he's using. 
24 Officer Wilson then tells me that the 
25 subject then enters through the opened driver's door

1 window with his upper body. And he details it is 
2 his upper body and both of his arms. 
3 The subject, according to Officer 
4 Darren Wilson, begins striking him in the chin, 
5 face, shoulders and chest. As he described it is 
6 the subject was swinging wildly. 
7 During this time Officer Wilson's 
8 trying to deflect the punches with his left hand 
9 while giving the subject commands to get back and 
10 move and stop. 
11 After that, Officer Wilson, he 
12 continues and states that subject then reaches 
13 backwards with his left hand, and basically removes 
14 his left hand and arm from the vehicle and hands 
15 something to the other subject and says, "here, take 
16 this," is what Officer Wilson says that he hears the 
17 larger subject say. 
18 He did not, nor did I ask, describe 
19 what he thought was handed off, but he said that he 
20 handed something. 
21 He continues that immediately after 
22 the subject says, "here, take this." He then 
23 quickly moves his left arm and hand back into the 
24 vehicle and then punches Officer Darren Wilson in 
25 the right side of the face.

1 Officer Wilson then tells me that 
2 this instantly stunned him and he starts basically 
3 backing away and leaning back. Officer Wilson tells 
4 me he continues with his left hand and forearm to 
5 try to deflect the punches that he's being hit with 
6 and then he starts going, as he puts it, through the 
7 progression on his belt. 
8 He thinks about grabbing his mace, 
9 which is situated on his duty belt, however, he is 
10 in a seated position and he can't retrieve it and it 
11 is on the right side of his belt. 
12 He then considers using an asp baton. 
13 What an asp baton is, is a retractable baton that's 
14 standard issue for law enforcement. He says that he 
15 believed that due to the confined space from within 
16 the patrol vehicle, that it would be an ineffective 
17 tool. 
18 And at this point I believe I asked 
19 Officer Darren Wilson if he thought he could escape 
20 any other way? And he says no. 
21 He describes the interior of the 
22 patrol vehicle or the Tahoe as having a computer and 
23 a radio and a shotgun in the center console, which 
24 prevented him from being able to climb over or get 
25 out of the passenger side of the vehicle.

1 I asked Officer Darren Wilson to 
2 continue. He stated that he then used his left 
3 forearm, again, to try to create space between 
4 himself and the subject, and then he retrieves his 
5 department issued firearm from his holster, which is 
6 situated on the right side of his belt.

He then removes his department issued 
17 firearm from his holster and begins to raise it and 
18 as he's raising it he yells, he said he yelled, stop 
19 or I'll shoot. 
20 Officer Wilson then tells me the 
21 subject then grabs with his hand the top of the 
22 slide of the firearm. And he says that his hand is 
23 large enough to encompass the top of the slide. The 
24 majority of the hand grips and the trigger guard, 
25 and that's with Darren Wilson, he says his hand is

2 The subject then responded with, 
3 "you're too much of a pussy to shoot me." And that 
4 was a quote from Darren Wilson. 
5 Q Did he give you any of his opinions or 
6 thoughts about what was going on when he says, "you 
7 are too much of a pussy to shoot me," or did he just 
8 kind of tell you what happened? 
A Just told me what happened.

10 
11 A The subject makes that statement. And 
12 then immediately following that statement, the 
13 subject then forces the firearm in a downward angle 
14 and Officer Darren Wilson tells me he can feel the 
15 barrel of his own firearm pressed against his left 
16 hip as he is in the seated position. 
17 Officer Wilson then continued stating 
18 that once he felt the barrel of the weapon pushed 
19 into his hip, he was able to shift his lower half to 
20 the right and basically get the barrel of the 
21 firearm to now be pointed at the seat and off of his 
22 hip. 
23 He then with his left hand, with his 
24 right hand on the gun, on the handgrips of the gun,

1 of the frame of the weapon. And then is able to 
2 push it away from him to where the weapon is now 
3 pointed at the driver's door. 
4 He says that he then pulls the 
5 trigger and nothing happens, the gun misfires. 
6 He continues by stating that he 
7 believed that due to the subjects hands being on the 
8 top of the slide and on the trigger, I'm sorry, on 
9 the hammer, that's what caused the gun to misfire. 
10 Officer Wilson continues and states 
11 that he then pulled the trigger again, at which time 
12 one round of ammunition was fired. 
13 Immediately following that, he sees a 
14 large explosion of glass and then looks down and 
15 sees what he believed was blood on his hands. He 
16 said at that point he didn't know if he was injured 
17 or the subject was injured, just knew that he saw 
18 blood. 
19 Officer Wilson continued that the 
20 subject hands were still on the gun and he pulled 
21 the trigger two more times and it misfired both 
22 times. 
23 The subject then reentered the 
24 vehicle and assaulted Officer Darren Wilson by 
25 punching him several more times in the face and then

1 stopped the assault and ran eastbound on Canfield 
2 Road away from the vehicle. 
3 Q So one shot you said was fired inside, 
4 while he was sitting inside the vehicle? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And he considered, he realized he 
7 could not escape, I'm not saying he should escape, 
8 he considered that he could go to the left side or 
9 passenger side, he was blocked by the shotgun or? 
10 A Yes, he describes that there's a computer, 
11 a large center console with a radio and like the 
12 controls to the light bar and siren, and then a 
13 shotgun. And there's just no means of escape 
14 through the passenger side of the car. 
15 But he said he did consider that?

1 A Yes. He says that the subject is then 
2 running east on Canfield, and Officer Darren Wilson 
3 then exits his vehicle and upon doing so, he says he 
4 radioed to his dispatcher that shots were fired, and 
5 he continued to exit the vehicle. 
6 He says he observed the subject 
7 running east on Canfield at which time he pursued on 
8 foot. 
9 He says after, or during this chase, 
10 he's giving the subject loud, verbal commands as he 
11 puts it, to stop and to get on the ground. 
12 Officer Wilson then tells me that the 
13 subject then stops and turns around. He estimated 
14 the distance was approximately 30 feet from him. 
15 So at that time Officer Wilson 
16 stopped in the street and then began to order the 
17 subject to stop and get on the ground. 
18 He continues and tells me that as he 
19 turns around, the subject has, as he quotes it, "an 
20 intense and psychotic look on his face." The 
21 subject then takes his right hand and moves it 
22 towards his waistband on the right side. 
23 Officer Wilson then says the subject 
24 screams something inaudible, doesn't know what he 
25 said, but just screams something and begins to

1 charge him. And that's Officer Wilson's word was 
2 charge. 
3 As the subject is moving towards him, 
4 he is giving him, continually giving him commands to 
5 stop. As he is backpedaling to try to, as he says, 
6 try to maintain the distance between the two. 
7 He then continues and states that he 
8 knew if the subject were to reach him, that he 
9 would, and he quotes, "he would be done." Meaning 
10 that Officer Wilson would be done. He knew, he 
11 immediately stated he knew he was overpowered and 
12 assaulted already one time in the vehicle. 
13 Officer Wilson continued and stated 
14 as the subject got within 15 feet of him, he 
15 discharged five rounds of ammunition. He said that 
16 this had no effect and the subject continued towards 
17 him. 
18 Q Did he indicate whether, did he, he may 
19 not have, indicate whether or not any of the five 
20 rounds entered the body of Michael Brown? 
21 A He did not know, nor did I ask. He just 
22 said that the subject continued to come towards him. 
23 Q Did he indicate to you how, when the 
24 subject turned around, I think you said that he put 
25 his arms some kind of way and charged him?

Officer Wilson kind of spoke with his

7 Q Can you stand up and show us, please? 
8 A Yes. When the subject turns around, his 
9 right and goes to his waistband. Now, he did not 
10 say in his waistband or he just says to his

12 And like we kind of covered earlier, 
13 the cursory interview is not to get, it is more so

1 A Yes, he says that the first shots were 
2 five, he believes it was approximately five rounds 
3 of ammunition and the subject continued towards him. 
4 He then discharged two additional, 
5 approximately two additional rounds of ammunition, 
6 and he said those had no effect and the subject 
7 continued towards him. 
8 He then states that the subject 
9 started to lean forward and to Officer Darren Wilson 
10 appeared that the subject was attempting to tackle 
11 him, and that's his word was tackle. At which time 
12 he discharged one additional round of ammunition.

2 anything in his hands, did he mention he had 
3 anything in his hands at the time? 
4 A He says when, the way he describes it is 
5 when he reaches back and says, "here, take this." 
6 That he hands something off to the other individual, 
7 but he doesn't know what it was. So he just says, 
8 he left it at something. 
9 Did you 
10 state that after the first shot went off in the car 
11 when he was trying to gain control of his weapon, 
12 that it misfired two more times?

14 is three. The first time he pulled the trigger he 
15 said that it misfired. The second time he pulled 
16 the trigger it fired and then he said he tried two 
17 additional times and they misfired.

1 misfire. 
2 Throughout this he never says that 
3 Michael, the subject, takes his hand off the weapon 
4 until he continues the assault, the second assault 
5 in the vehicle. 
6 Just to follow-up, did you 
7 have a sense for how long that altercation lasted? 
8 A He approximated a minute from start to 
9 finish. 
10 When we 
11 talk about misfire, can you kind of walk us through 
12 that process what it looks like? 
13 A Sure. So there's many reasons. And like 
14 I said, I'm not a firearms expert, however, in my 
15 job I do carry a firearm and know some things about 
16 it is that a weapon can misfire for many different 
17 reasons. 
18 One of them being if there's anything 
19 that is impeding the hammer of the firearm from 
20 coming forward and striking the firing pin, that 
21 will cause the weapon to misfire. So if you put 
22 anything in there, a piece of rope, or as the case 
23 may be, if a hand is pushed down on that hammer, it 
24 won't let that hammer cycle and won't allow the 
25 weapon to fire. Does that clarify it?

2 So the bullet would remain in the gun, it 
3 would not have impacted, it potentially would be 
4 able to be shot again, there would no casing 
5 discharged? 
6 A Correct. So if the weapon misfires in 
7 that form, the casing will not be discharged, the 
8 round that is currently in the chamber will still be 
9 a live round, it will still fire if the gun cycles

Q 
Yes. 
And that's on top of the weapon, at least 
21 in the area where Officer Wilson said Michael Brown 
22 had his hands, correct? 
A That is correct. 23 
24 Q Can you explain to the jurors what 
25 stovepiping means?

1 A Stovepiping is a term used in firearms 
2 where the round, a live round will be, it could be a 
3 spent round also, casing is basically partially 
4 ejected and is situated in a manner that looks like 
5 the round is sitting vertical on the gun. If I'm 
6 explaining this right, to where it would look like a 
7 stovepipe coming out of an oven. And that basically 
8 means that the casing was not fully extracted from 
9 the chamber and the gun did not cycle properly. 
10 Q And is it possible, again, we will have a 
11 firearms expert testifying about this, has that ever 
12 happened to you? 
13 A At the range, yes. I mean, it is a 
14 malfunction that is not common, but it does occur. 
15 Q And so if there would be something 
16 blocking that cartridge from flying out of that 
17 ejection port, it could be stuck inside partially in 
18 and out of the weapon, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And if that were to occur, would you be 
21 able to discharge another round with that 
22 projectile, that cartridge still partially in that 
23 ejection port? 
24 A No. And also when that casing is 
25 stovepiped, it allowed, the gun is out of battery,

1 which means it won't cycle again. So you would have 
2 to clear the malfunction, and there's a drill that 
3 they train us on of how you would have to clear the 
4 stovepipe, the round. 
5 I'm This 
6 is going back to the time that you arrived at the 
7 Ferguson Police Department to speak with Officer 
8 Wilson, Darren Wilson. And at the time you said he 
9 showed you where his gun, where he says that his gun 
10 was contained in his package. 
11 A Uh-huh. 
12 Can you describe that 
13 package for us? 
14 A I can. It is a manila envelope, which is, 
15 I'd probably say 9 by 13 size, and what it looked 
16 like is I didn't see if it was sealed because the 
17 way it was positioned on the table is that the flap, 
18 I guess for it, was positioned down, if that makes 
19 sense. 
20 Yeah, that is what I 
21 wanted to know. 
22 
23 
A Sure. 
I need clarification if it 
24 was sealed or not. And from the time of the 
25 incident until the time that Officer Darren Wilson

1 was transported to Christian Northwest to document 
2 his injuries or whatever, can you give me some idea 
3 about how much time had elapsed from that point to 
4 the point that he arrived at the hospital? 
5 A Well, the only thing I could speak of is 
6 the time that we were notified at this point. I 
7 don't exactly know what time the incident occurred 
8 and what time he departed the scene, it wasn't part 
9 of my responsibility or my interview at the time. 
10 I know that we were notified at 
11 12:43. I arrived at 1:30 on scene and I first 
12 contacted Officer Darren Wilson at 2:00p.m. 
13 The conversation at Ferguson Police 
14 Department lasted minutes, not long at all and then 
15 he was transported to Christian Northwest Hospital. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: How long would you say, how 
17 much time did you spend with him at Christian 
18 Hospital. 
19 A I probably say 30 minutes. Obviously it 
20 took some time to get photos taken and then any time 
21 that either a registration nurse, a physician's 
22 assistant or nurse would enter the room, the 
23 interview would basically just stop for privacy 
24 reasons. That would be common practice even if it 
25 was a normal investigation.

1 So from 
2 the time that you finally left him at the hospital 
3 or whatever. 
4 A Uh-huh. 
5 Do you know about what 
6 time that was? 
7 A I probably say I left probably between 
8 2:45 and 3:00. From that point I returned back to 
9 the Ferguson Police Department. 
10 Yes, ma'am. 
11 During 
12 the scene, the time that the officer was still 
13 positioning his car, struggling with Mr. Brown, did 
14 he ever indicate that he was trying to call for 
15 help? 
16 A I'm sorry? 
17 Did he ever say that he 
18 was trying to call for help or backup? 
19 A He did not. He said that initially even 
20 before, as you put it the altercation took place, he 
21 says that he requested, advised the dispatcher he 
22 was conducting a pedestrian check and then he 
23 requested an assist car at that point before the 
24 confrontation at the vehicle ever took place. 
25 So when an officer in his

1 position will call for help, does he have a 
2 microphone here or radio dispatch on his waist? 
3 A In a later interview with Officer Wilson, 
4 we found that he keeps the radio on his right side. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: You are pointing to your 
6 left side? 
7 A I'm sorry, it is on his left side, I 
8 apologize. I'm sorry, on his, thank you, his left 
9 side. And then there would be a radio inside of the 
10 vehicle also. 
11 So still He 
12 gets out of the car and he tells him to halt, but he 
13 says the victim kept running. So at that time he 
14 still had not called for backup? 
15 A He says that as he's exiting the vehicle 
16 he announces shot fires and requested assistance at 
17 that point. That would be once he is getting out of 
18 the car. 
19 He's --
20 A I'm sorry? 
21 Did he fire once he got 
22 out of the car or did he call and then fire? 
23 A No, he, okay he, I'm trying to explain it 
24 to where. So essential what happens is after, he 
25 tells us that after the first shot that went off

1 while he was in the vehicle, the subject comes back 
2 in and assaults him and then takes off running east 
3 on Canfield away from the car. 
4 Uh-huh. 
5 A Officer Wilson then tells us that he opens 
6 his door and as he is exiting the vehicle, he gets 
7 on his radio and announces, or notifies his 
8 dispatcher of shots fired and requests an assist 
9 car. 
10 So at that point that would be his 
11 second, as he puts it, second radio transmission 
12 regarding this incident announcing where he 
13 announced shots fired and requested assistance at 
14 that point. 
15 So what did he say would 
16 be his reason to keep firing after he got out of the 
17 car and calling for help? 
18 A Okay, uh --
19 If the suspect is running, 
20 then what would be your initial reason to keep 
21 shooting? 
22 A As Darren Wilson describes it, the subject 
23 turned around at that point. He doesn't tell us 
24 that he fired any rounds from the time that he got 
25 out of the car to the time that the subject turns

1 around. He just announces on the radio that shots 
2 were fired. 
3 And from being a police officer as 
4 long as I have, that's the same thing as an officer 
5 needs aid, requesting immediate assistance, if you 
6 hear, you are a neighboring police officer and you 
7 hear any police officer and yell shots fired, that 
8 means that obviously something bad has happened. 
9 I guess 
10 at the point where Michael Brown turned around, did 
11 Officer Darren Wilson, did he indicate he had any 
12 injuries? 
13 A He doesn't, he doesn't say. Are you 
14 talking about Officer Wilson or the subject? 
15 The subject. 
16 A He doesn't say nor do I ask. He just says 
17 he turns around and then the hand goes to the right 
18 side of his waistband. He never says that he saw 
19 any injuries on the subject nor did, like I said, 
20 nor did I ask. 
21 After the shot 
22 was fired in the car, you said he saw blood on his 
23 hand. Was Officer Wilson referring to his own hand 
24 or Michael Brown's hand? 
25 A He was referring to his own hands. So

1 that's when he says, he tells me that he didn't know 
2 if he was injured, as far as he being Officer 
3 Wilson, or the subject was injured. He didn't know, 
4 he just saw the blood. 
5 You said you've 
6 investigated several officer shootings, is it 
7 typical that prior to your arrival, that the officer 
8 already has a lawyer there? 
9 A It can happen. I mean, it does happen on 
10 certain occasions and it would not impede us or 
11 change anything with the way we proceed. I mean, we 
12 would ask every police officer, just like we ask 
13 every victim or every witness or every suspect, if 
14 they would be interested in having a conversation or 
15 if they would be okay with an interview. 
16 And we just assume that the attorney 
17 would and with what happened is, his attorney sat 
18 there and didn't say a word. 
19 And this case there isn't 
20 say, for instance, Ferguson Police Department, there 
21 isn't a lawyer staffed in the building readily 
22 available, it would have been just like anyone else, 
23 it would have been called in on Saturday, I imagine?

1 magazine, lock the slide to the rear, which would 
2 remove the stovepipe round and the round that was 
3 somewhat forced into the chamber, or the barrel of 
4 the gun. You would have to reinsert the magazine 
5 and then put the slide forward and that would

10 If a gun was, if a weapon 
11 was, a shot was fired inside the car that there

1 kind of that way for a reason. They are 4 feet by 
2 6 feet. And with just one interviewer and a person 
3 being interviewed, is very tight. 
4 So with two detectives, a person 
5 being interviewed and their attorney, that room, 
6 those rooms are just not conducive for that type, 
7 the amount of people. 
8 So the room that we chose to use is a 
9 small conference room with a table and about six 
10 chairs that are around it. So it was more 
11 accommodating, we would use that option if we needed 
12 it on any interview.

18 he is to leave? 
19 One last 
20 question. After your initial interview, the cursory 
21 interview, did you return back to the scene and 
22 report or how does that work? 
23 A What occurred is I returned, I left 
24 Christian Northwest Hospital and returned to the 
25 Ferguson Police Department initially. While I was

1 there, I waited maybe 10, 15 minutes for Officer 
2 Wilson to return and Lieutenant Colonel to 
3 return. 
4 It was at that point when they did 
5 return, we seized, when I say we, I'm referring to 
6 Detective seized the uniform worn by 
7 Darren Wilson during the incident. And that's at 
8 which time his weapon was seized and it was in that 
9 evidence envelope or that manila envelope that we 
10 had talked about earlier. So that's when the weapon 
11 and uniform were seized. 
12 Following that, I did return to the 
13 scene there on Canfield Green Apartment Complex. 
14 The reason for that is, goes hand in hand with our 
15 cursory interview. The way I explained it earlier 
16 is that with the information that I obtained through 
17 the cursory interview, I provide that to Detective 
18 so that it will allow the members of the 
19 police department at the scene to make sure we have 
20 encompassed everything that might be involved. 
21 So they have a statement that will 
22 either, you know, if they need to look over here for 
23 evidence or over there, they know based on the 
24 cursory statement. We would do that with any 
25 witness or anybody that could give us any

2 wrong word, make us look in the right spot, if you 
3 understand what I'm saying, I'm sorry. 
4 
5 A Yes. 
6 Do you feel that the way 
7 the weapon was handled before it got to your St. 
8 Louis County investigator, compromised the 
9 investigation in any way? 
10 A No, it is just different than what St. 
11 Louis County would do. However, chain of custody 
12 was maintained and that's really the only thing that 
13 would be important to me as an investigator that it 
14 went from Officer Darren Wilson, to Detective 
15 to Detective those are 
16 the chains that, obviously, I would be concerned 
17 about. It appeared that it was maintained, so. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: And also looking at my 
19 notes I neglected to ask, you've mentioned that you 
20 investigated a number of police officer involved 
21 shootings? 
22

A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And have you interviewed

16 To begin the afternoon session what I 
17 would first like to do is to play an audio file that 
18 is contained on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 17. 
19 Remember, this is one of those I renumbered. I 
20 think it used to be 9 or 10, but anyway, it is now 
21 Grand Jury Number 17. I'm going to play a recording 
22 of an interview of Darren Wilson and the interview I

1 start this, this interview is the interview that 
2 talked about that was recorded in a 
3 conference room at the police headquarters. 
4 And so as you can see from the transcript, 
5 the main speakers are Detective and in the 
6 transcript that is DET. and then when Darren 
7 responds it is D. Wilson.

9 They both have the distinctive voices 
10 and hopefully it won't be to confusing for you to 
11 tell who is speaking. 
12 Also during the interview you will hear 
13 that they give Darren Wilson a map to write on and 
14 then also a photo lineup that they ask him if he can 
15 identify somebody. 
16 So that happens later in the interview.

18 put them up on the screen if you like, but those are

11 minutes, which I can't imagine it is going to take 
12 30 minutes, when we come back we'll stop it. If it 
13 stops before, then we'll just, said he would

2 the grand jury to give further testimony? 
3 A I will. 
4 Q All right. So just for today, I'm not

11 Wilson?

Now, on what day did you interview Darren 
August 28th, 2014. 
Now, during the time of your involvement 
14 with this investigation, was there a time when the 
15 FBI agents involved and the attorneys are either 
16 with the U.S. Attorney's office or Department of 
17 Justice kind of agreed to work together with the 
18 county investigators in conducting interviews 
19 together? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Were you aware prior to your interview of 
22 Darren Wilson, were you aware that he had already 
23 been interviewed by county detectives about the

And did you have a copy of that interview? 
Yes. 
And had you listened to it prior to your 
4 interview of Darren Wilson? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So now given that he's already given an 
7 interview with the county detectives, why is it that 
8 you decided to interview him again on the 28th? 
9 A As we do separate investigations, my 
10 investigation is a civil rights investigation. Part 
11 of that and what I do in investigating civil rights 
12 is violations under the color of law, which that's 
13 why we're taking a look at this shooting, is to see 
14 if Officer Wilson was in violation of his sworn 
15 duties. 
16 And because of that, he is a subject 
17 of an investigation and very important and we are, 
18 it is separate, excuse me, from a homicide 
19 investigation, what the county is conducting, so we 
20 felt it necessary to conduct a separate interview. 
21 Q And at the time that Michael Brown, I'm 
22 sorry, Darren Wilson was interviewed by the county 
23 detectives, was that before you all started 
24 conducting joint interviews? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.

1 Q And the joint interviews, is it time 
2 saving for detectives as well as less inconvenience 
3 for witnesses and so forth?

Correct.

14 correct?

4 And then we went into August 9th, 
5 2014, where he was working a shift from 6:00 a.m. to 
6 6:00 p.m. Around noon, just before noon he received 
7 a call, a sick call he referred to it as. An infant 
8 who had a fever. While he was at that call he heard 
9 over the radio a call for a stealing in progress 
10 where, is it okay if I refer to my notes? 
11 Q Sure. 
12 A Sorry, I don't mean to look down. He 
13 heard it was at a market, he didn't hear which one 
14 and he heard a description over the radio saying the 
15 subjects were walking towards the QuikTrip, stole 
16 Cigarillos and one subject was wearing a black 
17 shirt. 
18 Wilson cleared that sick call because 
19 the mother and the infant were taken to the 
20 hospital. He cleared the call and he was going 
21 eastbound on Canfield. The sick call was in an 
22 apartment complex, I believe it is called 
23 Northwinds, and to get back to West Florissant, I'm 
24 sorry, west on Canfield. 
25 And as he's driving, he sees two

1 individuals in the middle of the road walking single 
2 file and as he pulls up, he sees who he identifies 
3 later at a later date as of the date of the 
4 interview as Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown. He 
5 didn't know them before.

7 point knew that the deceased was Michael Brown and

that the other gentleman is Dorian Johnson, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q But during your interview, did he refer to 
them by name, those names then? 
A He did. 
Q But did you clarify with him that this 
14 was, were these individuals he had ever heard of or 
15 had any contact with previously? 
16 A We did clarify and no, he did not. He did 
17 not know who they were prior to this interaction. 
18 Q Okay. So you say he sees these two 
19 subjects who he now knows as Michael Brown and 
20 Dorian Johnson, what happened next? 
21 A Dorian was first, so he pulled up next to 
22 him and asked him why don't you guys walk on the 
23 sidewalk. He made the statement, it wasn't in a 
24 confrontational way because he was more concerned 
25 about going back to the station to have lunch, it

2 Dorian's response was, we're just 
3 about to our destination, Dorian was not 
4 confrontational either. 
5 And Officer Wilson's response was 
6 okay, but what's wrong with the sidewalk. And 
7 Dorian kept, he continued to walk and Officer Wilson 
8 said he did not pay attention to Michael Brown and 
9 he was somewhat blocked. He has a big mirror, he 
10 was driving a Tahoe, so the mirror is quite large 
11 and Michael was blocked, he was just in that spot. 
12 Because he was interacting with 
13 Dorian Johnson, didn't notice Michael walking or any 
14 demeanor and so when he says okay, but what's wrong 
15 with the sidewalk, Michael says, "fuck what you have 
16 to say." 
17 I'm sorry, let me refer to my notes. 
18 Officer Wilson's attention was then drawn to Michael 
19 Brown and he noticed that Michael Brown's hands were 
20 full of Cigarillos. He looks in his rear view 
21 mirror and also saw that Dorian was wearing a black 
22 T-shirt. 
23 Thinking back on the call, Michael 
24 Brown was wearing a gray T-shirt and the call was 
25 they stole Cigarillos and one was wearing a black

1 shirt. So kind of putting two and two together or 
2 thinking that these might be the two guys, he puts 
3 the car into reverse. 
4 Q Now, when you say putting two and two 
5 together, is that what he was telling you that he 
6 put two and two together or is that your 
7 interpretation of it? 
8 A He said he recalled the description that 
9 came out over the radio. I think I'm using that, I 
10 don't know what you would call that, but yes, he 
11 said that. 
12 Q As much as possible because, obviously, 
13 you know, I don't want you to add to the statement 
14 or even interpret something that you believe he 
15 meant or said if he said it a certain way. So as 
16 best you can, stick with what he told you. So he 
17 said he recalled that earlier call about the 
18 stealing Cigarillos? 
A Yes, ma'am. 19 
20 
21 
Q And then what did he say happened? 
A He said he put the car, I'm sorry, he 
22 called over the radio said I'm on Canfield with two, 
23 send me another car, that's quoted. 
24 He then put his vehicle into reverse 
25 and angled the rear of the vehicle towards the

2 from getting away, or walking any further. 
3 He said, Officer Wilson said his plan 
4 was to stall them until another officer got there. 
5 He was not going to try to arrest or even question 
6 either one of them because he was out numbered and 
7 incredibly outsized by Michael Brown. In fact, he 
8 quoted as saying, he would overpower me. 
9 So before Wilson gets out of his car, 
10 he tells Brown, come over here a minute. Wilson 
11 attempted to open the door and Brown, Michael Brown, 
12 shoved the car door back at him. 
13 And Michael Brown said to him, "what 
14 the fuck are you going to do about it." 
15 Wilson, Police Officer Wilson 
16 unsuccessfully tried to open the door again, Michael 
17 Brown ducked his head in because he was taller than 
18 the vehicle, ducked his head in down, came in 
19 through the driver's side window swinging his arms, 
20 he described him swinging his arms wildly at Wilson. 
21 He said Brown's right hand connected 
22 with the left side of his face. Wilson tried to get 
23 Michael Brown off him and also block the blows that 
24 were coming at him.

1 around and handed the Cigarillos that were in his

3 around and hit Officer Wilson in the face with 
4 Michael Brown's left hand. 
5 Officer Wilson describes going 
6 through what he described as a force triangle in his 
7 mind, and that is the way he said they were trained. 
8 He knew he could use one level of force higher than 
9 was being applied to him, excuse me, than the threat

2 He did not carry a taser, so that 
3 wasn't even and option. 
4 He had his asp baton on his belt and 
5 a mag flashlight in the passenger side. He said it 
6 would have given up too much of his body, Michael 
7 would of had to, could hit him more parts of his 
8 body if he tried to reach for either of those. He 
9 also couldn't deploy the asp baton inside the 
10 vehicle because it is collapsable. 
11 Wilson said he thought Brown could 
12 beat him to death. He knew from his training 
13 because for just that reason, he was allowed to use 
14 deadly force. 
15 He pulled out his gun and told Brown, 
16 stop I'm going to shoot you. Brown's response was 
17 and I quote, Officer Wilson quoting Brown, "you're 
18 too much of a pussy to shoot." 
19 Brown grabbed the gun and twisted it 
20 down pointing at his left hip. And Officer Wilson 
21 attempted to raise the gun with Michael's hand on it 
22 and aimed, he described he aimed at the silhouette 
23 of Michael Brown through the car because he could 
24 not raise it. He couldn't pull the gun high enough 
25 to go through the open window.

15 off. 
16 Officer Wilson attempted to pull the

18 pulled the trigger a third time and the gun fired 
19 through the door, driver door panel. The window 
20 being down, glass flew everywhere. 
21 I'm sorry, Brown's right hand was on 
22 the gun when it fired.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
I don't recall and I don't know that even 
25 Officer Wilson knows when exactly, but he noticed

1 that there was blood on his right hand and he 
2 assumed that he had gotten cut when the glass flew 
3 everywhere. 
4 After the gun goes off, Brown stepped 
5 back from the car. He described somewhat in shock 
6 and Brown puts his hands together at his right hip, 
7 he demonstrated. And Officer Wilson thought maybe 
8 he was hit there, which is why he put his hand 
9 there. 
10 He said Brown then became enraged 
11 where Officer Wilson describes his face looking like 
12 a demon. 
13 Officer Wilson was confused that 
14 Brown wasn't then running away, knowing that 
15 situation, assumed that that would be to get Brown 
16 away from the door and to go because he had just 
17 been shot, but Brown re-engaged. 
18 And also at this point in time, 
19 Officer Wilson did not know where Dorian Johnson 
20 was. The last time he saw him was when he did the 
21 Cigarillos handoff. At that's when the rest of that 
22 time, the interaction, he never saw Dorian Johnson. 
23 Q Does Officer Wilson describe that, so are 
24 you saying that he says when he fired the weapon 
25 into the door, he believed or thought that the

2 Michael Brown, is that what you are talking about? 
3 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
When you say that? 
Based off of his action, also he didn't 
6 know where the bullet went, but he was aiming 
7 through the door when Michael Brown is engaged in 
8 the car, he pulled both of his hands down towards 
9 his right hip and thought maybe that's where, if he 
10 was hit, just based off that action not because he 
11 saw a wound and not because he saw blood. 
12 Q Okay. And so then, what happened you said 
13 that he then described his face as looking like a 
14 demon and he is confused as to why he wouldn't have 
15 run away at that point. What happened then, what 
16 did he say then? 
17 A Both of the Brown's hands came back 
18 through the window. Officer Wilson just showed us 
19 his left arm up defensively trying to block Brown 
20 from punching him. 
21 Wilson put his, the gun up and pulled 
22 the trigger again, the gun didn't fire. He 
23 described what blind racking the gun, it is pulling 
24 the slide back without looking. I don't know what 
25 he, I don't know if he used his hands to rack it,

1 but he thought something had happened to the gun. 
2 He didn't know if the gun, he 
3 described it as stovepiping, which could be two 
4 bullets trying to go in and then neither will fire. 
5 He didn't know if he ejected a full cartridge, which 
6 would be the projectile along with the casing or 
7 just the spent casing was stuck in there, he didn't 
8 know, he didn't look.

16 would that be fair to say?

19 could have also gone ahead, if I wasn't here, I

Correct. 
But his words were blind racked? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. So what does he say happens after 
5 he blind racks the gun? 
6 A He fired the gun again, he pulled the 
7 trigger again, the gun fired and he saw, and he 
8 wasn't looking where he was shooting he said, he saw 
9 a cloud of dust in the dirt across the street and 
10 assumed Michael Brown had not been hit because 
11 that's where he assumed the projectile landed. 
12 Q So did he tell you when before firing this 
13 weapon now, the second shot, did he tell you was he 
14 aiming in a particular place or was Michael Brown 
15 still beside the vehicle? 
16 A Yes, he was. He describes him, and again, 
17 because I'm not sure what hand, he just shows him 
18 blocking Michael Brown's blows with his left hand. 
Q Okay. 19 
20 A So after he fired that shot, that's when 
21 Michael Brown again ran away. Upon which time 
22 Officer Wilson called over the radio, shots fired, 
23 send me more cars.

1 radio in the car and there's a radio that he has on 
2 his person. So when you're inside a call car you 
3 can hear and also transmit. He's not sure if he 
4 said that with his car radio or with his handheld. 
5 Q He remembers making a call and those 
6 words, but doesn't know if it was the car radio or 
7 his mobile walkie-talkie? 
A Correct. 
Q And then what happens? 
8 
9 
10 A So Officer Wilson got out of the car to 
11 chase Mr. Brown because, and he describes because 
12 Michael Brown was a fleeing felon. And he was just 
13 doing his job, those were his words. 
14 He said Brown had just assaulted and 
15 attempted to kill him with his own duty, with 
16 Wilson's duty weapon. 
17 Officer Wilson did not want Michael 
18 Brown to cause injury or death to anyone else. He 
19 knew Brown would assault another responding officer 
20 or witness as Brown had just assaulted him. 
21 And Officer Wilson wanted to know, he 
22 wanted to give chase, he wanted to know where Brown 
23 was going. And in an attempt to apprehend Michael 
24 Brown once other officers got there.

1 are testifying about he is basically explaining why 
2 he thought he was justified in pursuing the subject, 
3 correct? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Was that in response to questions that you 
6 asked him directly or were you just letting him 
7 narrate this and this is information he just 
8 provided in a narrative form? 
9 A That was in direct response. It is 
10 possible, and the way my notes are written, I go 
11 back and write and try to chronological order. He 
12 could of at first give us the rundown, said what he 
13 did and then we would go back and say why. 
14 In my notes I tried to put it in 
15 chronological order. So he went and gave chase and 
16 I put in my notes in that same spot why, when we 
17 asked him why. 
18 Q Okay. And that was his explanation you 
19 already testified about. And then what did he say 
20 after he explained why he pursued the subject? 
21 A He explained that he expected Michael 
22 Brown to run for a while. So when he got out of the 
23 vehicle he did still have his gun in his hand, but 
24 it was down at his side because it is easier for him 
25 to run instead of having it pointed at Michael

1 Brown. And also because Michael was running away 
2 from him, he did not feel he was an immediate threat 
3 to keep his gun pointed on him. 
Q Okay. 4 
5 A As he was running after him, he told 
6 Michael get on the ground, get on the ground. And 
7 again, he said he thought Michael was going to run 
8 for a while. 
9 While he was running, Officer Wilson 
10 noticed a line of three cars lined up behind him, 
11 specifically he noticed a green Pontiac. He said he 
12 did not fire any shots at Michael Brown as Michael 
13 Brown was running away. 
14 At some point, a short time after 
15 Brown stopped and turned around to face Officer 
16 Wilson. Officer Wilson will describe Brown as 
17 grunting, he grunted, hopped and began toward 
18 Officer Wilson. 
19 When Brown hopped, he said he put his 
20 right hand in his waistband. At the time Officer 
21 Wilson didn't know whether or not he was armed. He

1 left arm, left hand was clenched in a fist at his 
2 side. 
3 Wilson shouted stop, get on the 
4 ground, and Wilson explained at this point during 
5 the interview that Brown was just not listening to 
6 any of his commands. 
7 Wilson started shooting as Brown ran 
8 towards him. Wilson shot more than once, but was 
9 unsure how many times. And he realized he had 
10 tunnel vision, so he shot more than one time and 
11 realized that all he was looking at was that right 
12 hand. 
13 Wilson, I'm sorry, he said during 
14 this string of thoughts, Michael Brown had jerked 
15 back as if he had been shot, but Officer Wilson did 
16 not know where Michael Brown was hit. 
17 Q So he doesn't describe seeing, like what 
18 we see on TV, pow, pow, immediately blood spurt and 
19 you would see it on the shirt, he doesn't describe 
20 seeing anything like that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No, he didn't. 
Okay. Did he say anything other than, you 
23 know, you said he has testified before he had made

25 him through the door, did he say anything else about

Q 
No, he didn't. 
Okay. You can go ahead. 
4 A He said after Michael Brown kind of jerked 
5 back, he said Michael stopped briefly, but then 
6 started running towards him again. He described 
7 Michael Brown's chest as being puffed up. Michael 
8 Brown's hands were still in his waistband. 
9 So Officer Wilson began to back up. 
10 Brown was about eight feet away from Wilson when, 
11 and Wilson thought to himself, if he gets me, I'm 
12 dead. 
13 Brown ran towards Wilson with his 
14 head leaning down. Officer Wilson thought he only 
15 shot one time, but it could have been more. 
16 He saw the bullet hit Michael Brown 
17 in the head and he saw Michael Brown fall to the 
18 ground face first. He said Michael Brown fell with 
19 such, because he had such momentum going forward, 
20 that when he landed on his face, his feet came up 
21 behind him. 
22 Officer Wilson made a statement all 
23 he had to do was stop and Officer Wilson would have 
24 stopped shooting. 
25 At no point did Michael Brown comply

1 with Officer Wilson's command or his order to 
2 surrender and Michael Brown never had his hands up. 
3 We had Officer Wilson draw just on a 
4 white sheet of paper a simple depiction of the scene 
5 and we are going to keep that with our case file. 
6 After Michael Brown went to the 
7 ground, he called over the radio on his handheld and 
8 said, "I need a supervisor and everyone you've got." 
9 While Officer Wilson was running 
10 after Michael Brown, he was looking around for 
11 people because he was concerned with, he didn't know 
12 if Michael Brown had a gun, he was concerned that 
13 other people might get shot in the crossfire. 
14 Q Wait a minute. So he kind of backtracked 
15 in his statement a little bit. 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Now he's already got to the point where 
18 he's shot him and a fatal injury has him on the 
19 ground. So now he backtracks a little bit and says 
20 when he was chasing him? 
21 A When he was chasing and I'm sorry, I'm 
22 explain that a little better. He knows there are a 
23 lot of people around once Michael Brown was on the 
24 ground. He said while he was chasing him, this is 
25 all within a matter of seconds, he didn't notice

1 anybody else. Once Michael Brown went to down to 
2 the ground, he saw a lot of people in the community, 
3 an apartment complex around. 
4 He said Officer was the first 
5 one on the scene. And he had, Officer Wilson had 
6 Officer secure the scene or block the 
7 street. 
8 Wilson called for an ambulance. The 
9 next two arrivals were Ferguson Police Department 
10 Officer and at the time because there was 
11 really, West Florissant to get onto Canfield is the 
12 only way to connect to a major roadway, both were 
13 west of the scene. So Officer Wilson had Officer 
14 move his vehicle to the east side so they 
15 could block that, so they could secure the scene, 
16 maintain some scene control. 
17 Q To block vehicular traffic that might be 
18 coming westbound on Canfield? 
19 A Yes. Officer Wilson described feeling 
20 unsafe standing next to Brown's body since he was 
21 the shooter. He thought, the area is known for 
22 violence, guns, gangs and drugs. They did not have 
23 a good relationship with the police. He kind of 
24 felt he really had a spotlight on him. 
25 He walked towards his vehicle which

And then he shut the door? 
Yes, ma'am. 
He didn't get in the car? 
He did not. 
All right. 
I don't know if other officers arrived, 
I'm sorry, the Ferguson Sergeant responded. 
Wilson told Sergeant that he had killed Brown. 
16 He quoted himself as saying, "he grabbed my gun and 
17 I shot him." 
18 told him to go, told Wilson to 
19 go sit in Wilson's car. And Wilson said, no, 
20 because then everyone will know it was me because 
21 everyone around him is working and he's not.

23 told him to go back to the station, to not take

And Wilson described that he thought 
that it was strange that Sergeant wouldn't have 
3 another Ferguson police officer go back with him 
4 because he was just involved in a shooting, that 
5 even minutes after the scene a lot of people showed 
6 up. I think he described it the police officers 
7 being outnumbered 300 to 1. 
8 So he drove back to the station, he 
9 noticed that his handheld radio was on channel 3 
10 instead of channel 1. Channel 1 was the Ferguson 
11 dispatch and channel 3 was St. Louis County Police 
12 Department Dispatch. He wasn't even sure, while he 
13 could hear St. Louis County, he wasn't sure if he 
14 keyed up that they would hear him whatever he said. 
15 He believes that the radio switch 
16 during the struggle in the car, but he's not 
17 positive, actually, because he's not usually on 
18 channel 3, excuse me, not channel 3. 
19 When Wilson got back to the station 
20 he washed the blood off of his hands. His primary 
21 concern was not of evidence, but as a biohazard or 
22 what possible blood hazards it might attract. 
23 So no one at the station photographed 
24 Officer Wilson's hands because there was no one 
25 there to photograph them.

1 Right after he washed his hands he 
2 went to the roll call room, he made his gun safe, 
3 which means he took out any bullet and packaged it 
4 as evidence, that's how he described it to us. 
5 He did not wait for somebody else to 
6 bag that as evidence because he saw blood on the 
7 gun, thought it was Brown's blood, wanted to 
8 preserve the DNA. He didn't want to risk because he 
9 believed that would prove that he had his hand on 
10 the gun.

Wilson knew that was the attorney to call

6 
Ferguson Police Officer came into the roll call

9 until he spoke with an attorney and he did not 
10 comment on what happened. 
11 After the Attorney arrived, 
12 St. Louis County Police Department Detective 
13 and Lieutenant Colonel also came to 
14 speak with Wilson. 
15 Between and 
16 Wilson, they noticed Wilson's face was red and 
17 swollen, so they collectively decided they were 
18 going to take him to the hospital. They took him to 
19 Christian Northwest emergency room. Shortly before 
20 they took him there, Wilson described Detective

22 continued it after they got to the emergency room.

1 one had ever before attempted to take his firearm. 
2 Officer Wilson had been trained to 
3 use physical force when a physical threat was 
4 present. 
5 Michael Brown became an immediate 
6 threat to Wilson's safety when Michael Brown came 
7 into the car, when Michael Brown hit Officer Wilson. 
8 Michael Brown went for Officer 
9 Wilson's firearm and Michael Brown charged towards 
10 Officer Wilson after Brown had already run away. 
11 Michael Brown was a threat to the

20 no way, shape or form am I offering any opinion 
21 whatsoever.

23 of the statement?

1 report. It is Wilson's responsibility to write an 
2 incident report, but as of August 28th, 2014, 
3 Officer Wilson had not been back to the station, so 
4 he has not had the opportunity to write an incident 
5 report. 
6 Q So he's basically told you that after the 
7 shooting and contacting, having contact with 
8 Sergeant he goes directly to the Ferguson 
9 Police Department, can't talk to anybody about this 
10 until possibly his attorney arrives and then 
11 ?

Q 
Yes, ma'am.

18

20 sustained any other injuries to the backs of his 
21 hands or on his hands?

3 far after the incident. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, do you have any 
5 additional? 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: I do.

8 this occurred and you didn't interview him until 
9 August 28th? 
10 
11

Q

Yes, ma'am. 
At what point was that? 
That was, initially when he made contact 
16 with both Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown, his 
17 attention was drawn to Dorian Johnson because Dorian 
18 was first and also responded to his, hey, can you 
19 guys use the sidewalk, or whatever verbiage he had 
20 used. 
21 When he said what's wrong with the 
22 sidewalk, his attention was then turned towards 
23 Michael Brown because Michael Brown responded to 
24 him, "fuck what you have to say," or excuse me, I'm 
25 sorry, yes, that's what he said. Once Michael Brown

1 said that, his attention was drawn, Officer Wilson's 
2 attention was drawn to Michael Brown, at which time 
3 he then saw the Cigarillos that Michael Brown was

6 before any physical altercation, right?

22 because what happened to change that, did he say?

24 stall, try to have a conversation with them in a

1 about the robbery. I don't necessarily, forgive me, 
2 I don't think he said arrest, he just said before he 
3 even mentioned anything about the stealing in 
4 progress, he was going to wait for other officers to 
5 get there. 
6 Q Okay. So did he, so he said he knew about 
7 the stealing in progress because of the Cigarillos. 
8 He was not going to mention the stealing in 
9 progress, he was just going to stall them? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
Did he talk to you about what he went out 
12 on his radio to say that he was doing a check with 
13 two people, to send him a car? 
A Yes. 14 
15 Q Did he say that he told the dispatcher 
16 hey, I've got two guys involved in this stealing at 
17 this Ferguson Market and I see one with Cigarillos? 
18 A Right, no, he did not say that. He 
19 specially mentioned the fact he doesn't often asked 
20 for assistance on calls, so when people hear him 
21 over the radio saying, send me more cars, they know 
22 he needs another car. 
23 Why he didn't mention the stealing 
24 would be my conjecture. 
25 Q But let me say he didn't?

Q 
To him. 
To him. Did he say why he thought Michael 
15 Brown would continue to run? I think that's what 
16 you said that he knew he would continue to run? 
17 A That was based on his training and 
18 experience that he believed Michael Brown starting 
19 to run away, and based off his training and 
20 experience he believed Michael Brown was going to 
21 continue running versus stop and turn around. 
22 Q And did that factor into his thought 
23 pattern, did he say? Did you understand what that 
24 meant? 
25 A In that limited perspective, yes. But

1 again, I also am trained in law enforcement, so I 
2 understand. So to go further to explain why he may 
3 have thought that would be putting my personal 
4 understanding, not using, putting words into his 
5 mouth.

7 that officer and we don't want you to. 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes. 
But tell me what you mean by your personal 
10 experience as a law enforcement officer? 
11 A Someone running who runs away, who as he 
12 described it, attempted to assault him. And then 
13 was not going to and had not yet complied, would 
14 likely not, but you would still be prepared at this 
15 point for whatever happens.

18 that was a comment that required him to confront him 
19 about it?

11 Brown put his hands towards his waistband? I'm

14 I have a question.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
Because he was, when they were at the

20 both of his hands towards his --

Is there anything of evidentiary value 
9 when I ask that question about evidentiary value, I 
10 mean anything that's significantly bad or good about 
11 his records, or that might factor into this case? 
12 A I did. I did read that Officer Wilson 
13 received a letter of accommodation for handling a 
14 call when he was an officer with Jennings Police 
15 Department. 
Q Anything else? 16 
17 A There was, there were, he did have use of 
18 force reports, but that's standard practice. I 
19 didn't see anything out of the ordinary. There was 
20 a complaint made against him and two other officers 
21 describing that was ultimately found to be 
22 unfounded, to describe Officer Wilson and two others 
23 attacks, an African-American male who was just 
24 walking down the street in the city and used racial 
25 slurs towards him, beat him up so badly that he had

1 bleeding on his brain. 
2 What was found to have actually 
3 happened was this gentleman was breaking in and was 
4 inside Officer Wilson's car. The three officers who 
5 were off duty at the time went outside and tried to 
6 detain him, he ran away. 
7 When they chased him, I don't know 
8 which one of them tackled him on the ground, he hit 
9 his face on the way down. 
10 This was an internal affairs 
11 investigation, the investigation was completed and 
12 they discussed with the hospital that the 
13 individual, the person who was either the victim of 
14 use of force or stealing a car, his injuries were 
15 consistent with what the officers described and that 
16 there was no bleeding of the brain.

1 if we could, you mentioned that Darren in reference 
2 to this neighborhood said it is an area known for 
3 gangs, violence, guns and he didn't feel safe. And 
4 I think that really, I don't know, is alarming to 
5 hear. So how would you kind of say that fit into 
6 the case or was there more depth to it when he said 
7 that. 
8 A It had to do with, I guess the atmosphere. 
9 He described that when almost immediately after, 
10 he's not sure when it happened, but once Michael 
11 Brown was down on the ground, the residents were 
12 outside. He said, and the crowd kept growing 
13 increasingly hostile because he knows from being a 
14 police officer in that area, people generally don't 
15 like to see the police. 
16 So based on the fact of what just 
17 happened, he did not feel safe. Whether it means 
18 by, it would be my conjecture and I can't do that. 
19 Is there 
20 any part of Officer Wilson's testimony or statement 
21 that you believe is in conflict with any of the 
22 physical evidence you are aware of? 
23 A I don't, I cannot make that judgment. My 
24 sole purpose is simply to collect the facts. It is 
25 up to the prosecuting attorneys and any future jury

2 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask you a question, 
3 though, prior to you questioning Darren Wilson, to 
4 your knowledge had he read any police reports 
5 documenting the investigation? 
6 A Not to my knowledge, no. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Have any reports, first of 
8 all if he has, I haven't gotten any reports, so I 
9 don't know where anybody else would have them. To 
10 your knowledge, he had no knowledge of the 
11 investigation? 
A Correct. 12 
13 
14 
MS. ALIZADEH: And then regarding autopsy 
reports, to your knowledge, Dr. who was 
15 the medical examiner in this case, he had not read 
16 that report; is that correct? 
17 A No, he had not. If Officer Wilson knew 
18 anything about the case, it is the same thing anyone 
19 who heard in the news what was ever released to the 
20 news is what he would know. Ferguson Police 
21 Department is not doing an investigation, that was

23 was turned immediately over to St. Louis County.

1 not give him any information. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We can ask him when he 
3 testifies what he may have learned or whatever or 
4 what have. Are you aware that there is all kind of 
5 rumors and talk about various things involving what 
6 people believe happened in this case, correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And to your knowledge though, as far as 
9 the physical evidence like where the shell casings 
10 were or where blood was found or any of that type of 
11 evidence, he wouldn't have privy to? 
12 A No, he would not be privy to, other than 
13 being actually on the scene, but no, no reports. 
14 When 
15 you first, when he said he got to the police 
16 station, he washed his hands and he didn't have 
17 anybody take pictures because there was nobody else 
18 there. But then later he said that he saw 
19 
20 
21 
a police officer, so was 
there. Was the only officer that was there? 
A At that time, I think the way I 
22 interpreted his statement to us is he gets to the 
23 station, no one is there that he sees immediately. 
24 I don't believe he went searching, he didn't say he 
25 went searching, but he has blood on his hands. His

And did you have any confrontation with

12 A While on the sick case call, a call came 
13 out for a stealing in progress from the local market 
14 on West Florissant, that the suspects traveling 
15 towards QT. I didn't hear the entire call, I was on 
16 my portable radio, which isn't exactly the best. I

19 have a select amount. Usually there is one 
20 available, but I usually elect not to carry one. It 
21 is not the most comfortable thing. They are very 
22 large, I don't have a lot of room in the front for 
23 it to be positioned. 
24 Q Had you been trained on how to use a

1 observed two men in the middle of the street, they 
2 are walking along the double yellow line single file 
3 order. 
4 Q Okay. And you say something to them, did 
5 they say something to you first? 
6 A No, you want me to just go with the whole 
7 thing? 
8 Q Sure, go ahead, let's start there. 
9 A I see them walking down the middle of the 
10 street. And first thing that struck me was they're 
11 walking in the middle of the street. I had already 
12 seen a couple cars trying to pass, but they couldn't 
13 have traffic normal because they were in the middle, 
14 so one had to stop to let the car go around and then 
15 another car would come. And the next thing I 
16 noticed was the size of the individuals because 
17 either the first one was really small or the second 
18 one was really big. 
19 And just for the conversation, I 
20 didn't know this then, but the first one's name was 
21 Dorian Johnson, the second one was Michael Brown. 
22 That was discovered, I think, the following day is 
23 when I learned the names. I had never seen them 
24 before.

1 that Brown had bright yellow socks on that had green 
2 marijuana leaves as a pattern on them. They were 
3 the taller socks that go halfway up your shin. 
4 As I approached them, I stopped a 
5 couple feet in front of Johnson as they are walking 
6 towards me, I am going towards them. And I allowed 
7 him to keep walking towards my window, which was 
8 down. As Johnson came around my driver's side 
9 mirror I said, "why don't you guys walk on the 
10 sidewalk." He kept walking, as he is walking he 
11 said, "we are almost to our destination." 
12 Q Do you think he used those words 
13 destination, we are almost to our destination? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. He said we are almost to our 
15 destination and he pointed this direction over my 
16 vehicle. So like in a northeasternly (sic) 
17 direction. And as he did that, he kept walking and 
18 Brown was starting to come around the mirror and as 
19 he came around the mirror I said, "well, what's 
20 wrong with the sidewalk." Brown then replied, urn, 
21 it has vulgar language.

23 
Q

1 expected response from a simple request. 
2 When I start looking at Brown, first 
3 thing I notice is in his right hand, his hand is 
4 full of Cigarillos. And that's when it clicked for 
5 me because I now saw the Cigarillos, I looked in my 
6 mirror, I did a doublecheck that Johnson was wearing 
7 a black shirt, these are the two from the stealing. 
8 And they kept walking, as I said, 
9 they never once stopped, never got on the sidewalk, 
10 they stayed in the middle of the road. 
11 So I got on my radio and Frank 21 is 
12 my call sign that day, I said Frank 21 I'm on 
13 Canfield with two, send me another car. 
14 I then placed my car in reverse and 
15 backed up and I backed up just past them and then 
16 angled my vehicle, the back of my vehicle to kind of 
17 cut them off kind to keep them somewhat contained. 
18 As I did that, I go to open the door 
19 and I say, hey, come here for a minute to Brown. As 
20 I'm opening the door he turns, faces me, looks at me 
21 and says, "what the fuck are you going to do about 
22 it", and shuts my door, slammed it shut. I haven't 
23 even got it open enough to get my leg out, it was 
24 only a few inches. 
25 I then looked at him and told him to

1 get back and he was just staring at me, almost like 
2 to intimidate me or to overpower me. The intense 
3 face he had was just not what I expected from any of 
4 this. 
5 I then opened my door again and used 
6 my door to push him backwards, and while I'm doing 
7 that I tell him to, "get the fuck back", and then I 
8 use my door to push him. 
9 Q You tell him to, "get the fuck back"? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q Okay. 
12 A He then grabs my door again and shuts my 
13 door. At that time is when I saw him coming into my 
14 vehicle. His head was higher than the top of my 
15 car. And I see him ducking and as he is ducking, 
16 his hands are up and he is coming in my vehicle. 
17 I had shielded myself in this type of 
18 manner and kind of looked away, so I don't remember 
19 seeing him come at me, but I was hit right here in 
20 the side of the face with a fist. I don't think it 
21 was a full-on swing, I think it was a full-on swing, 
22 but not a full shot. I think my arm deflected some 
23 of it, but there was still a significant amount of 
24 contact that was made to my face. 
25 Q Now, he was hitting you with what hand?

11 the ground or anything.

14 second. He kind of like, I remember getting hit and 
15 he kind of like grabbed and pulled, and then it 
16 stopped. When I looked up, if this is my car door, 
17 I'm sitting here facing that way, he's here. He 
18 turns like this and now the Cigarillos I see in his 
19 left hand. He's going like this and he says, "hey

16 to get out to have some type of control and not be

1 was trying to pull the handle, I see his hand coming 
2 back around like this and he hit me with this part 
3 of his right here, just a full swing all the way 
4 back around and hit me right here. (indicating) 
5 After he did that, next thing I 
6 remember is how do I get this guy away from me. 
7 What do I do not to get beaten inside my car. 
8 I remember having my hands up and I 
9 thought to myself, you know, what do I do. 
10 I considered using my mace, however, 
11 I wasn't willing to sacrifice my left hand, which is 
12 blocking my face to go for it. I couldn't reach 
13 around on my right to get it and if I would have 
14 gotten it out, the chances of it being effective 
15 were slim to none. His hands were in front of his 
16 face, it would have blocked the mace from hitting 
17 him in the face and if any of that got on me, I know 
18 what it does to me and I would have been out of the 
19 game. I wear contacts, if that touches any part of 
20 my eyes, then I can't see at all. 
21 Like I said, I don't carry a taser, I 
22 considered my asp, but to get that out since I kind 
23 of sit on it, I usually have to lean forward and 
24 pull myself forward to the steering wheel to get it 
25 out. Again, I wasn't willing to let go of the one

6 Also, when I was grabbing my asp, I 
7 knew if I did even get it out, I'm not going to be 
8 able to expand it inside the car or am I going to be 
9 able to make a swing that will be effective in any 
10 manner. 
11 Next I considered my flashlight. I 
12 keep that on the passenger side of the car. I 
13 wasn't going to, again, reach over like this to grab 
14 it and then even if I did grab it, would it even be 
15 effective. We are so close and confined. 
16 So the only other option I thought I 
17 had was my gun. I drew my gun, I turned. It is 
18 kind of hard to describe it, I turn and I go like 
19 this. He is standing here. I said, "get back or 
20 I'm going to shoot you." 
21 He immediately grabs my gun and says, 
22 "you are too much of a pussy to shoot me." The way 
23 he grabbed it, do you have a picture? 
24 Q I do have some pictures of your gun. 
25 Well, you can tell us if it is your gun, I believe

1 it is. 
2 A My gun was basically pointed this way. 
3 I'm in my car, he's here, it is pointed this way, 
4 but he grabs it with his right hand, not his left, 
5 he grabs with his right one and he twists it and 
6 then he digs it down into my hip. (indicating) 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Kathi, can you do the 
8 computer? I'm going to let you see these photos 
9 from Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10, and there's some 
10 numbers on the back of these photos just so we can 
11 keep track of what you are looking at. And I'm 
12 going to announce what they are and then I will let 
13 you tell us a little bit about them, okay? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
All right. 
Let me just get my glasses. These are 
16 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10, but the photo that I'm 
17 showing you is 60, 66, 63, so they're not in order 
18 and then 69, so if you could look at all of those 
19 photos. And tell me if that represents what you 
20 know to be your weapon and your ammunition? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, it does. 
Let me see if we can get this, let me try 
23 to get this started. We'll talk a little bit about 
24 while we're working on that. So those are photos of 
25 your weapons; is that correct?

Okay. And we are going to put it on the

9 tell us what's going on. 
10 I have a few other questions while we 
11 are waiting on that. So during the time that he's, 
12 you said Michael Brown is striking you in the face 
13 through the car door? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And it was your opinion that you needed to 
16 pull out your weapon because why did you feel that 
17 way, I don't want to put words in your mouth? 
18 A I felt that another one of those punches 
19 in my face could knock me out or worse. I mean it 
20 was, he's obviously bigger than I was and stronger 
21 and the, I've already taken two to the face and I 
22 didn't think I would, the third one could be fatal 
23 if he hit me right. 
24 Q You thought he could hit you and it would 
25 be a fatal injury?

18 that's pointed at me, I'm holding that like this. 
19 So it is pointed at, I would be Brown, he grabbed 
20 with his hand over the top like this manner and then 
21 twisted it down like this. And when it twisted, it 
22 ended up being like this in my hip. That's all I 
23

needed that for. (indicating)

1 A He grabs my gun, says, "you are too much 
2 of a pussy to shoot me." The gun goes down into my 
3 hip and at that point I thought I was getting shot. 
4 I can feel his fingers try to get inside the trigger 
5 guard with my finger and I distinctly remember 
6 envisioning a bullet going into my leg. I thought 
7 that was the next step. 
8 Q I'm going to stand back so you can talk a 
9 little louder. 
10 A As I'm looking at it, I'm not paying 
11 attention to him, all I can focus on is just this 
12 gun in my leg. 
13 I was able to kind of shift slightly 
14 like this and then push it down, because he is 
15 pushing down like to keep it pinned on my leg. So 
16 when I slid, I let him use his momentum to push it 
17 down and it was kind of pointed to where the seat 
18 buckle would attach on the floorboard on the side of 
19 my car. 
20 Next thing I remember putting my left

You don't know if he was saying either? 
I heard stuff, but I couldn't tell you 
3 what it was. 
Q Okay. 4 
5 A Like I said, I was just so focused on 
6 getting the gun out of me. When I did get it up to 
7 this point, he is still holding onto it and I pulled 
8 the trigger and nothing happens, it just clicked. I 
9 pull it again, it just clicked again. 
10 At this point I'm like why isn't this 
11 working, this guy is going to kill me if he gets 
12 ahold of this gun. I pulled it a third time, it 
13 goes off. When it went off, it shot through my door 
14 panel and my window was down and glass flew out of 
15 my door panel. I think that kind of startled him 
16 and me at the same time. 
17 When I see the glass come up, it 
18 comes, a chunk about that big comes across my right 
19 hand and then I notice I have blood on the back of 
20 my hand. 
21 After seeing the blood on my hand, I 
22 looked at him and he was, this is my car door, he 
23 was here and he kind of stepped back and went like 
24 this. 
25 And then after he did that, he looked

1 up at me and had the most intense aggressive face. 
2 The only way I can describe it, it looks like a 
3 demon, that's how angry he looked. He comes back 
4 towards me again with his hands up. 
5 At that point I just went like this, 
6 I tried to pull the trigger again, click, nothing 
7 happened. 
8 Q When you say he came back up to you with 
9 his hands up, describe to us what he is doing? 
10 
11 
12 
A Last thing I saw was this coming at me. 
Q Was it a fist? 
A I just saw his hands up, I don't know if 
13 they were closed yet, on the way to going closed, I 
14 saw this and that face coming at me again, and I 
15 just went like this and I shielded my face. 
16 And you did what? Q 
A 17 Went like this and shielded my face. 
18 Did he hit you at that time? Q 
19 Yes. A 
20 Q Okay. Go ahead. 
A 21 So I pulled the trigger, it just clicks 
that time. 22 Without even looking, I just grab the 
23 top of my gun, the slide and I racked it, and I put 
24 my, still not looking just holding my hand up, I 
25 pulled the trigger again, it goes off. When I look

Q Okay. 
8

10 A When I look up after that, I see him start 
11 to run and I see a cloud of dust behind him. I then 
12 get out of my car. As I'm getting out of the car I 
13 tell dispatch, "shots fired, send me more cars." 
14 We start running, kind of the same 
15 direction that Johnson had pointed. Across the 
16 street like a diagonal towards this, kind of like 
17 where the parking lot came in for Copper Creek Court 
18 and Canfield, right at that intersection. And there 
19 is a light pole right there, I remember him running 
20 towards the light pole. 
21 We pass two cars that were behind my 
22 police car while we were running. I think the 
23 second one was Pontiac Grand Am, a green one. I 
24 don't know if it was a two door or four door, I just 
25 remember seeing a Pontiac green Grand Am.

1 When I passed the second one, about 
2 that same time he stopped running and he is at that 
3 light pole. So when he stopped, I stopped. And 
4 then he starts to turn around, I tell him to get on 
5 the ground, get on the ground. 
6 He turns, and when he looked at me, 
7 he made like a grunting, like aggravated sound and 
8 he starts, he turns and he's coming back towards me. 
9 His first step is coming towards me, he kind of does 
10 like a stutter step to start running. When he does 
11 that, his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his 
12 side, his right one goes under his shirt in his 
13 waistband and he starts running at me.

1 I shoot a series of shots. I don't know how many I 
2 shot, I just know I shot it. 
3 I know I missed a couple, I don't 
4 know how many, but I know I hit him at least once 
5 because I saw his body kind of jerk or flenched. 
6 I remember having tunnel vision on 
7 his right hand, that's all, I'm just focusing on 
8 that hand when I was shooting. 
9 Well, after the last shot my tunnel 
10 vision kind of opened up. I remember seeing the 
11 smoke from the gun and I kind of looked at him and 
12 he's still coming at me, he hadn't slowed down. 
13 At this point I start backpedaling 
14 and again, I tell him get on the ground, get on the 
15 ground, he doesn't. I shoot another round of shots. 
16 Again, I don't recall how many it was or if I hit 
17 him every time. I know at least once because he 
18 flinched again. 
19 At this point it looked like he was 
20 almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it 
21 was making him mad that I'm shooting at him. 
22 And the face that he had was looking 
23 straight through me, like I wasn't even there, I 
24 wasn't even anything in his way. 
25 Well, he keeps coming at me after

1 that again, during the pause I tell him to get on 
2 the ground, get on the ground, he still keeps coming 
3 at me, gets about 8 to 10 feet away. At this point 
4 I'm backing up pretty rapidly, I'm backpedaling 
5 pretty good because I know if he reaches me, he'll 
6 kill me. 
7 And he had started to lean forward as 
8 he got that close, like he was going to just tackle 
9 me, just go right through me. 
10 Q Can you demonstrate for us how he was 
11 leaning forward? 
12 A His hand was in a fist at his side, this 
13 one is in his waistband under his shirt, and he was 
14 like this. Just coming straight at me like he was 
15 going to run right through me. And when he gets 
16 about that 8 to 10 feet away, I look down, I 
17 remember looking at my sites and firing, all I see 
18 is his head and that's what I shot. 
19 I don't know how many, I know at 
20 least once because I saw the last one go into him. 
21 And then when it went into him, the demeanor on his 
22 face went blank, the aggression was gone, it was 
23 gone, I mean, I knew he stopped, the threat was 
24 stopped. 
25 When he fell, he fell on his face.

1 And I remember his feet coming up, like he had so 
2 much momentum carrying him forward that when he 
3 fell, his feet kind of came up a little bit and then 
4 they rested. 
5 At that point I got back on the radio 
6 and said, "send me a supervisor and every car you

Two went off in the car. And at this

1 was actually driving back to the station that my 
2 portable radio was on channel 3 and our main channel 
3 was channel 1. 
4 Q So nobody heard you say shots fired to 
5 your knowledge? 
6 A To my knowledge. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A They did ask me why my radio for the car 
9 was laying on the floorboard, asked me if I used 
10 that. I don't remember using that radio. I, for 
11 some reason, remember using this one. It could have 
12 been sitting in my lap, there is also that chance 
13 that I used that one. I don't know which one that I 
14 used.

16 your radio, you mean the mike --

19 radio is attached to the dash, correct? 
20 A Yes, it is in the center console. So the

A 
Q 
A 
When I'm chasing him? 
Yes. You get out of the car and run after 
My main goal was to keep eyes on him and 
6 just to keep him contained until I had people coming 
7 there. I knew I had already called for backup and I 
8 knew they were already in the area for the stealing 
9 that was originally reported. So I thought if I can 
10 buy 30 seconds of time, that was my original goal 
11 when I tried to get him to come to the car. If I 
12 could buy 30 seconds of time, someone else will be 
13 here, we can make the arrest, nothing happens, we 
14 are all good. And it didn't happen that way. 
15 So when he ran, you know, just stay 
16 with him, someone is going to be here, you know, 
17 we'll get him. 
18 Q And when you, when the second shot was 
19 fired inside the car, did you think he was hit at 
20 all?

A

No, I thought I missed. 
Both shots. You didn't see any blood on 
The first shot, judging by his reaction, 
25 he went back, I thought it went through the door and

Q 
A 
Okay. 
The second one I saw the cloud of dust and 
4 him running, I knew I missed. 
5 Q Okay. So you got out of the car, you are 
6 running, you are telling him to stop; is that right? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And he's not listening? 
9 A No, not until he gets to that light pole 
10 and that's when he stopped.

18 Once he walked past my car, I never saw him again. 
19 Q Okay. All right. And at some point you 
20 say Michael Brown does turn around? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Any idea what happened to make him turn 
23 around or he just all of the sudden turns around? 
24 A No, just turns around. His whole reaction 
25 to the whole thing was something I've never seen.

1 I've never seen that much aggression so quickly from 
2 a simple request to just walk on the sidewalk. 
3 Q Okay. Because you never did talk to him 
4 about the Cigarillos or the stealing at the Ferguson

MS. ALIZADEH: Said what? 
Darren, what do you need. I don't 
4 remember what my reply was and he said, did you call 
5 for an ambulance. I said I haven't, will you. I 
6 remember him calling twice, like he was about from 
7 me to you away on the radio calling. 
8 And then I look across and was 
9 starting to tape off the area, but I notice that all 
10 of our cars are parked this way, Brown is laying 
11 here, there is nothing on this side. I told 
12 to move his car to this side to block that side of 
13 the street off. He did that and then he resumed 
14 taping. 
15 After that I walked to my car and I 
16 put my gun up, I start walking away from the scene. 
17 As I'm walking away, I walk back to my car and I 
18 don't know if the door was open or shut, I think it 
19 was shut. I open the door, I reach in, I turn my

1 conversation, he said something first, but I said I 
2 have to tell you what happened. And he goes, what 
3 happened. 
4 I said, I had to kill him. 
5 He goes, you what? 
6 I said, he grabbed my gun, I shot 
7 him, I killed him. 
8 He goes, go sit in the car. 
9 I said, I cannot sit in the car. 
10 I remember him saying, Darren, sit in 
11 the car. 
12 I said, Sarge, I can't be singled

14 singled out in the car. I will leave if you want me 
15 to leave. 
16 He said, take my car and leave. So I 
17 got in his car and I drove to the police station.

19 made the difference where you felt you had to use a 
20 weapon to stop him?

22 that enough, was in my mind to authorize the use of 
23 force.

3 Q Okay. We're going to go with you to the 
4 station in just a minute, but I wanted to ask you 
5 about your relationship with the residents in the

7 A Uh-huh. 
8 Q Did you guys have a volatile, well, how 
9 can I put this. Did you not really get along well

A 
Q

There's a lot of gangs that reside or 
15 associate with that area. There's a lot of violence 
16 in that area, there's a lot of gun activity, drug 
17 activity, it is just not a very well-liked 
18 community. That community doesn't like the police.

20 in that community by yourself, especially when

1 in? 
2 A Yes, that's not an area where you can take 
3 anything really lightly. Like I said, it is a 
4 hostile environment. There are good people over 
5 there, there really are, but I mean there is an 
6 influx of gang activity in that area. 
7 Q All right. So you're driving yourself 
8 back to Ferguson, what are you thinking on the drive 
9 back to Ferguson? 
10 A I think I'm just kind of in shock of what 
11 just happened, I really didn't believe it because 
12 like I said, the whole thing started over will you 
13 just walk on the sidewalk and it developed into that 
14 in 45 seconds. 
15 And that's the only other thing I 
16 remember thinking about is I heard the car radio 
17 going off and mine wasn't. That doesn't make sense. 
18 So I hit the scan button on mine thinking the scan 
19 button got messed up, I wasn't getting everything. 
20 And I did that and it still, this one 
21 is going off and mine's not. So then I looked at it 
22 and I was on channel 3. I was like, I don't know 
23 what was heard or what wasn't heard.

1 way back I found that I had blood on the inside of 
2 my left hand and I already know I had it on the back 
3 of my right hand. And just from everything we have 
4 always been taught about blood, you don't want it on 
5 you, you don't touch it, you don't come in contact 
6 with it. 
7 And my original thought was that it 
8 was the glass had cut my wrist and cut my hand, 
9 which is why this hand was bleeding. And so 
10 thinking that I was cut with someone else's blood on 
11 me, I had to wash my hands. 
12 So I go directly to the bathroom. I 
13 actually washed them, went to the bathroom and then 
14 I looked, like I still had it like in my cuticles

disturbance, so didn't even know what it was. 
Q Okay. 
A I go in there, I asked to go get me a 
pair of gloves. goes gets me a pair of gloves, 
comes back, put the gloves on. I grab an 
9 evidence envelope, take my gun out of the holster, 
10 make it safe. I lock the slide back, take the 
11 magazine out, take the one round that's left in it 
12 out. I put it all in that bag, seal it with 
13 evidence tape and then sign it. 
14 Q And you handled your gun at that time with 
15 gloves on? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q And why did you do that? 
18 A To preserve any evidence on there, I knew 
19 his DNA was on that gun. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
How did you know his DNA was on the gun? 
When I first took it out, without even 
22 looking at it, I knew that he had fingerprints on it 
23 and possibly even sweat from, it was warmer that day 
24 so, and he could have sweat on it. When I took it 
25 out, I also saw blood on it.

Okay. All right. So you made, but you 
18 knew how to make the gun safe and put it in an 
19 evidence envelope based on your training and 
20 experience? 
21 A Yes, I was just trying to preserve all the 
22 evidence I could on the weapon. And I knew if I put 
23 it in an evidence envelope and sealed it, that it 
24 would have no other contact with anybody and it 
25 could be as preserved as you could get.

Okay. All right. And then what? 
I sat down and called for my attorney, who 
3 represents police for the union. He said he would 
4 be on his way. 
5 Officer came in, he gave me the 
6 card for the application for the Fraternal Order of 
7 Police. I said, I already called them. 
8 He said, would you like to tell me 
9 what happened so I can tell the media? I said, no, 
10 I don't want to talk right now. 
11 Lieutenant came in, he's 
12 actually my lieutenant who was off that day. He 
13 came in and said, has anybody told you what's 
14 happening? I said, I don't really know anything 
15 that's going on there. I left the scene pretty much 
16 right after. 
17 He said St. Louis County is 
18 investigating. I said okay, and then he left. 
19 And then right after he left, 
20 Ferguson Fire Department and EMS from Christian 
21 Northeast Hospital showed up. They stayed about 
22 this far away, they didn't actually come in the 
23 room. 
24 And they asked what happened?

3 I pointed this side, that side. 
4 They asked if I lost consciousness? 
5 I said, no. 
6 My vision was blurry? 
7 I said, no. 
8 Asked if I needed to go to the

10 I said, no, not right now. 
11 So is there anything else we can do 
12 for you? 
13 I said, no, not right now, and then

2 So my assistant chief drove me and 
3 to the hospital and Detective followed. 
4 Q Okay. And those photos that we looked at 
5 a minute ago were you at the hospital, correct? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q And then what happened after that? 
8 A At the hospital we did the interview. And 
9 when I went to the hospital, I didn't wear my 
10 uniform shirt, I took that off and my vest off, left 
11 it at the station, left my duty belt at the station. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Did someone tell you to do that? 
Yeah, and I felt more comfortable too 
14 because I obviously can't wear my gun, and I don't 
15 want to be in uniform after all of this without it. 
16 So I took the shirt off, just my 
17 undershirt, my pants, my boots, go to the hospital. 
18 While waiting to be treated in the waiting room, not 
19 in the waiting room, in the actual hospital room, 
20 Detective began his interview and then stopped 
21 as needed for nurses, whoever came in. They took

4 and then the assistant chief drove me and back 
5 to the station. 
6 He had already made a phone call, the 
7 assistant chief did to have Officer 
8 get a change of clothes for me, so 
9 they were going to take my clothes. They had blood 
10 on my left hip area. 
11 So when I get back I change, St.

14 A The only report I've seen was the one 
15 released on the news about the initial stealing.

17 was filed in relation to the theft of the 
18 Cigarillos?

12 before the gun is removed from the holster?

5 other details to insure in your own mind that maybe

A 
Q 
I don't recall. 
(By Ms. Whirley) You said you knew the 
4 area and you felt threatened in that area because 
5 there is violence and guns and everything, and that 
6 Michael Brown was being confrontational before the 
7 first blow, correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is there any reason why you didn't wait in 
10 the car until your backup came? 
11 A I thought I would be able to just stall 
12 until someone got there. I thought if I can get out 
13 of the car, I could maintain the distance that I 
14 need to maintain, they were close. I figure all I 
15 needed was 20 or 30 seconds and someone is going to 
16 be there. 
17 Q Right. So why wouldn't you stay in the 
18 car? 
19 A Because I had already been, my comfort 
20 zone is not to be sitting in the car talking to 
21 someone else. I wanted to be out of the car, that 
22 way if I need to run I can run. 
23 
24 
Q 
A 
You can run? 
If I was out and he started like chasing 
25 me or went to hit me, I could move.

1 Q You are in a car, you are more mobile in a 
2 car than you are on foot, right? 
3 A Right. But I also didn't want him to run 
4 away, so I need to kind of stay where I can keep him 
5 there, keep myself safe and wait for someone to get

Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Officer Wilson, I'm 
not trying get in your head, I mean, I guess we all 
are trying to get in your head at some point to know 
what you were thinking at the time, but, I mean, 
your initial confrontation or your initial contact 
with them, I mean, you didn't see any of them with 
14 weapons, correct? 
15 A No. 
16 Q And they weren't subjects that you knew to 
17 be armed and dangerous? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No. 
And you stop and encounter pedestrians 
20 probably almost on a daily basis when you are on 
21 patrol, would that be fair to say? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so did you at that point have any 
24 reason to anticipate that this, that Michael Brown,

6 
A 
Q 
I believe so. 
And then the second shot, was his body in 
7 contact with you on the second shot? 
8 A Probably not on the second one. I know 
9 when I first pulled the trigger it was, but it 
10 didn't shoot and then that's when I racked the gun 
11 and then shot again. 
12 Q And you used both hands, you had to use 
13 both hands to rack the gun?

15 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Was he still trying to hit you when you 
16 went to rack the gun?

1 ever just think about getting in that bad boy and

3 A No, I didn't. My thought is, I was still 
4 dealing with a threat at my car. You know, we're 
5 trained not to run away from a threat, to deal with 
6 a threat and that is what I was doing. That never 
7 entered my mind to flee.

9 do you recall grabbing Michael Brown by the throat?

1 process. You're in the car and someone, you're 
2 struggling, tugging back and forth, did you ever 
3 think that he had a gun right then and there, he 
4 could have used it at any time? 
5 A I wasn't thinking about that at that time. 
6 I was thinking about defending myself whenever he 
7 was hitting me in the car. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: 
9 So kind of going 
10 go on that as well. So the comment that you made to 
11 your supervisor Sergeant when he got there at 
12 the scene was that he went for my gun, I had to 
13 shoot him. I think that kind of goes along with 
14 that. Because I think when I hear someone say he 
15 went for my gun, if I literally take that comment, I 
16 would assume that someone literally went to your 
17 holster and tried to pull it out. Either 
18 unholstering it or literally taking it from you. 
19 And in this instance that was not the 
20 case. You had already unholstered and you were 
21 aiming at him. He essentially in his, your point of 
22 view and the point of view of who we can no longer 
23 obtain that, he deflected or pushed it towards you, 
24 but he did not at any point try to pull it from your 
25 holster is, I guess, my question?

1 department, after you washed off and everything, did 
2 you ever think at what time that I need to write a

4 A No. The protocol is whenever you are 
5 involved in a significant use of force, that you 
6 contact your FOP representative and then he will

From what I remember, yes. 
Okay. 6 to 8 hours? 
Yes. 
Felt rested, ready to go 
22 the next day. Just had to ask, curious. And then 
23 following the actual incident, you are back in your 
24 supervisor's car driving back to Ferguson Police 
25 Department. How far is that roughly from the crime

1 scene, the police department? 
2 A Mile and a half, 2 miles. 
3 So very short trip? 
A Yeah. 4 
5 And that was my thought 
6 too, but being in communication, I think, you know, 
7 in that situation, my first thought is to contact a 
8 loved one and say, I can't believe what just 
9 happened and that was my thought. If there was any 
10 sort of communication from that point moving forward 
11 on a personal cell phone or anything else? 
12 A No. 
13 So none whatsoever until 
14 you saw the officer at the Ferguson Police 
15 Department? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Thank you. 
18 Last 
19 question.

21 
MS. ALIZADEH: It just left your head. 
I have it. I'm trying to 
22 word it. Dorian, did you ever tell the police chief 
23 or any of the other officers that there was another 
24 person with him, did you ever try to look for 
25 Dorian?

1 A No, I haven't talked to the chief or 
2 anybody at the department in length about what 
3 happened. I told my sergeant what happened at that 
4 time, that was the end of our conversations with 
5 anybody from the department. 
6 This kind 
7 of dovetails with her questions about Dorian. I 
8 understand that you did an interview August 28th 
9 
10 
with 
A 
FBI agent; is that correct? 
Yes. 
11 Okay. At which time, I 
12 hope I'm getting this correct, I believe that there 
13 was, did they present to you a photo lineup of 
14 suspects or whatever?

And that would be

Okay. And they gave you a

11 whatever?

13 
A Yes. 
Okay. And you were 
14 required or they asked you to pick out Dorian 
15 Johnson at that time? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Were you able to pick him 
18 out at that time? 
19 A I selected who I believe was Dorian 
20 Johnson, they never confirmed if it was or not. 
21 They never did, okay. You 
22 don't know the results of that?

not in any way, are you? 
A No, I'm not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Prior to this incident, had 
4 you ever had any contact with any of the county 
5 detectives that you've met throughout this 
6 investigation? 
7 A No, I have not. 
8 Q Any of the agents, FBI agents or federal

10 A No, I have not. 
11 You felt like 
12 your life was in jeopardy when you were sitting in

1 something that we have not asked you that you want 
2 us to know or you think it is important for the 
3 jurors to consider regarding this incident? 
4 A One thing you guys haven't asked that has 
5 been asked of me in other interviews is, was he a 
6 threat, was Michael Brown a threat when he was 
7 running away. People asked why would you chase him 
8 if he was running away now. 
9 I had already called for assistance. 
10 If someone arrives and sees him running, another 
11 officer and goes around the back half of the 
12 apartment complexes and tries to stop him, what 
13 would stop him from doing what he just did to me to 
14 him or worse, knowing he has already done it to one 
15 cop. And that was, he still posed a threat, not 
16 only to me, to anybody else that confronted him. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Any questions? 
18 Along those 
19 lines, you feel like as a police officer it is your 
20 obligation to follow that suspect? 
21 
22 
23 then. 
24 
A Yes, sir. 
MS. ALIZADEH: All right. If that's it
