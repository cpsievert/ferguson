INTRODUCTION 
MR. MCCULLOCH: Thank you. I'm Bob 
Page 5 
3 McCulloch, the Prosecutor, for the record. I want 
4 to talk to you a little bit about this. As you are 
5 well aware of what we are here about and that is the 
6 shooting death of Michael Brown. 
7 I want to tell you how this is going to 
8 proceed. Obviously, it is going to be different 
9 from a lot of the other cases that you've heard, 
10 that you've heard during your term. 
11 First things first. Let me introduce, I 
12 say a lot of this you already know. These two 
13 ladies, for the record, Kathi Alizadeh, Shelia 
14 Whirley, they will be the primary, if not the 
15 exclusive attorneys working in the grand jury on 
16 this case. 
17 Obviously, I hope, obviously, there be a 
18 lot of other people working on things outside of us 
19 getting it ready for the presentation that will be 
20 made by Kathi and/or Sheila. 
21 Kathi was the prosecutor I have on call 
22 for the month of August for all homicide calls. So 
23 she received the call about this shooting within 
24 minutes of the time the County Police were notified 
25 by the Ferguson Police. So she has been working

1 with the police and lots of other things on this 
2 since the very beginning. 
3 My procedure is always that I have a 
4 prosecutor on call solely for homicide cases and 
5 they stay with that case from start to finish, 
6 whatever that ultimately may be. 
7 Sheila, as you know, has been assigned to 
8 the grand jury for this term and so she will 
9 continue with this grand jury on this case for as 
10 long as it does take. 
11 There are a few things I do want to go 
12 over, first and foremost, to tell you that this is 
13 the first, last and probably the only time I think 
14 that you will see me in relation to this case. 
15 Certainly in the grand jury. Everything that we do, 
16 everything that you do, will be recorded with the 
17 court reporter, who is under the same oath, 
18 essentially, as all the witnesses. 
19 As I said, Kathi and Sheila will be the 
20 primary attorneys, the attorneys responsible for 
21 presenting everything to the grand jury. 
22 Really, I'm going to go over just a few 
23 things to make sure that we have kind of the ground 
24 rules, but the procedure covered. 
25 As you know, your term ends on the lOth of

1 September. You also have dockets, there is no 
2 docket next week, but on the 3rd and lOth, we have 
3 dockets. Those dockets will be adjusted, but they 
4 won't be canceled. But they will be adjusted to 
5 accommodate whatever time that we need for 
6 presentations on this case. 
7 This case is still in the middle of an 
8 investigation, there is a lot going on and certainly 
9 you are well aware of what's going on in the 
10 evenings and during the day and even out in front of 
11 the courthouse here on occasions. 
12 So there is a lot that is still going on 
13 with the officers gathering the evidence, evidence 
14 is being tested, being evaluated. I say evaluated, 
15 it is being looked at, firearms evidence, the 
16 firearms people are looking at that, DNA evidence, 
17 the DNA are examining that. 
18 In addition, the federal government, U.S. 
19 Department of Justice, is doing a parallel, but an 
20 independent investigation of the same thing. 
21 So a lot of, actually everything pretty 
22 much that the County Police or any other state or 
23 local department is doing is being replicated by the 
24 U.S. Attorney, by the FBI, or by the Justice 
25 Department, they are all part of the Justice

1 Department. 
2 As that is going back and forth and there 
3 is some witnesses they will be talking to that the 
4 County Police may not necessarily be talking to. 
5 Some that the County had talked to that they haven't 
6 or won't talk to. And so, but all of that will be 
7 traded. We're giving them all the statements we 
8 have, they are passing statements and any other 
9 information that they have on this matter back to 
10 us. 
11 So it is still independent of one another, 
12 but sharing the information because what is 
13 significant to this case is also significant to 
14 theirs. They are looking at different 
15 possibilities. 
16 The federal government and the state 
17 government are not the same. We have these criminal 
18 charges, they look at potential civil rights 
19 violations, but for the same conduct that we are 
20 looking at for any potential criminal violations. 
21 So that may add a little bit, a little bit 
22 of a delay. I really don't want to say a delay, but 
23 kind of giving things to you out of order here 
24 somewhat. Like a trial, lots of information is 
25 going to come to you and it is going to come out of

1 chronological order. We will kind of go through 
2 that just as a schedule. The schedule is just that. 
3 There will be time if we have a particular 
4 area, just for example, the DNA evidence. If that 
5 is available or when that is available and all of it 
6 is available, not just part of it, we will have the 
7 time that is in the next two weeks to present that 
8 to you all at once. If it is a number of witness 
9 statements, we will present all of those to you. We 
10 will have it all organized and bring it in. 
11 By the time everything is finished, you 
12 will have heard everything, you will have every 
13 statement, there will be as many witnesses to come 
14 in and testify. 
15 If they made statements, you will not only 
16 get the statements they made, whether they are to 
17 police, FBI, or television or on the internet or 
18 anything else. If we've got those statements, you 
19 will have those statements. You will also have the 
20 witness who will come in and testify as to that. 
21 Some certainly might be they are just 
22 statements that are floating around on the internet 
23 and nobody knows who is making that statement, but 
24 everybody is doing that and the FBI is doing what 
25 they can to locate any of those or the source of

1 them. 
2 So the schedule though after 
3 September lOth, your term is extended, and the only 
4 matter that you will hear anything on will be this 
5 Michael Brown case, the Michael Brown shooting. All 
6 you get is that so you won't have the docket. There 
7 will be another grand jury that starts the week 
8 after that who will be doing what you have been 
9 doing for the past four months. 
10 By the way, greatly appreciate your 
11 service on that. I don't want to lose that in the 
12 message here. You have done a great job, a great 
13 service for the people of this county. 
14 But the schedule will then, it is as 
15 flexible as flexible can be. It is the only matter 
16 that you have and so there is no requirement that 
17 you meet on Wednesdays. So whenever all 12 people 
18 are available, because all the evidence will be 
19 presented to all 12, so we get all 12 of you 
20 together, we will work with everybody's schedule. 
21 Obviously, we want to be as expeditious as 
22 possible, but not rush through it. If that means we 
23 are meeting four hours in the morning and whatever 
24 works is what we are going to do. Saturdays, 
25 evenings, however it works for everybody's schedule,

1 and as long as you get it. If all 12 of you have an 
2 entire day, we will have an entire day. 
3 If you have four hours sometime, we will 
4 work all of that out, but we will work, obviously, 
5 around your schedules and you know how that's been. 
6 It is a little easier, I suppose, when you could 
7 tell family and employers and the like every 
8 Wednesday you had to be gone. So this will be a 
9 little different, so we will have to coordinate all 
10 of that. 
11 Also, not necessarily a requirement, we do 
12 want to meet here, but there is no requirement of 
13 that. If it turns out to be a Wednesday, then we'll 
14 figure out something on that. 
15 Everything will be recorded. Starting 
16 with the oath by the court reporter and everything 
17 that I'm saying now and everything that anybody 
18 says, whether it is a witness, whether it is one of 
19 the attorneys, or one of the jurors, will be 
20 recorded as we are going along. 
21 The value in the court reporter is that 
22 we're getting at least a rough transcript as we are 
23 going along. So that will, we won't have to wait 
24 six months for all of these tapes to be typed up if 
25 we did it in some other fashion.

1 The other is that the questions, you know, 
2 unlike a trial jury, you know, you can and have been 
3 discussing what you've heard on perhaps between 
4 witnesses or during breaks and the like. Remind you 
5 that's part of your deliberation and so none of that 
6 happens while there is anybody else in the room and 
7 that includes, of course, the attorney and the court 
8 reporter. 
9 At the end of every witness, the reporter 
10 will make an announcement that essentially he is 
11 going to finalize the disc. For every witness who 
12 testifies and every session of their testimony, 
13 there will be a separate disc made so that when he 
14 finalizes that, what it does is it finalizes the 
15 disc. 
16 After that, it can't be altered, nothing 
17 can be added, nothing can be deleted. And so if 
18 that witness comes back at some other time, there 
19 will be a separate disc for that and we will do the 
20 same. We will do that with every person who comes 
21 in and testifies. 
22 You will have presented to you every bit 
23 of evidence from the photos, from the scene of the 
24 shooting, diagrams of that, the physical evidence 
25 that was seized at the time, at the location, the

1 DNA evidence, anything and everything that pertains 
2 to this case will be presented to the grand jury. 
3 It will all be available to you for your review as 
4 it is coming in. 
5 Sheila, primarily, will be at least 
6 getting things started in terms of asking the 
7 witness questions, much as you've seen her for the 
8 whole summer doing that. 
9 Jurors, and you're experienced enough now 
10 that you can ask whatever questions you want to ask. 
11 Any item, anything you want to ask any witness, 
12 absolutely ask that information. 
13 If something occurs to you sometime after 
14 that witness is gone, we will get the witness back 
15 at some point and ask those questions again. If 
16 somebody else says something, you need to clarify 
17 it, we will get witnesses back to do whatever it is 
18 that you need done. 
19 The one thing we can't do in terms of 
20 questions, let me back up a little bit on that while 
21 we are talking about the records on that. 
22 Just remember that it is going to take a 
23 few minutes to finalize this disc once that witness 
24 is finished testifying. So if you have discussion, 
25 you want to talk or ask each other questions,

1 anything at all about that, make sure you wait long 
2 enough that that is finalized and they understand 
3 is out of here and the attorneys out of here. 
4 They will stick around long enough to remind you of 
5 that, wait until everybody is gone before you talk 
6 about it because that's, that's not something that 
7 anybody but the jurors hear. 
8 If you have a question about procedure, 
9 the attorneys will answer that. Who is coming in 
10 next, you know, we are taking a break now or can we 
11 take a break now, anything along the procedure the 
12 attorneys will certainly answer that. 
13 If you have a question about what a 
14 witness said or what is going on or did this witness 
15 say this, they're not going to answer those 
16 questions. If anything, we will get the witness 
17 back to answer any more questions that you asked, 
18 but we are not going to answer those questions. 
19 Just a couple other things. I assume the 
20 judge talked to you this morning, of course, about 
21 your oath, of course, both very similar to what 
22 just took, whatever the witness will take, 
23 that these are confidential proceedings, that 
24 nothing leaves this room unless and until ordered by 
25 the court or some other legal method. I will talk

2 The other is the confidentiality and the 
3 oath and the anonymity. You are anonymous. You are 
4 protected by law from all, your names are not 
5 public, your addresses, no information about you is 
6 public. 
7 There may be some, the demographics of it, 
8 I think that is information that can be passed out 
9 in terms of, you know, race, gender. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Age. 10 
11 MR. MCCULLOCH: I won't say the age. The 
12 general location that we have. Say, I don't know, 
13 three grand jurors who live in municipalities and 12 
14 who live in unincorporated or nine live in 
15 unincorporated. We have X number who are outside of 
16 the 270 loop, X number inside. So many above 70, 
17 below 70, all of that demographic information, but 
18 nothing that would, anybody would ever be able to 
19 identify any individual from just that no matter how 
20 they try to put it together. 
21 And that is, I just want to share, that's 
22 protected by law that's been litigated and those 
23 names, the information does not get released. 
24 So the other is with the parking. We are 
25 trying to arrange the parking very similar to what

are meeting some other day, you 
7 know, there may be media around, but the good thing 
8 about construction going on next door is we can kind 
9 of work around the visibility of it, particularly 
10 with the parking that we had. We will have all of 
11 that arranged. 
12 And the media, you know, the media kind of 
13 comes and goes around here. I did a number of 
14 interviews with local people today for a couple 
15 reasons, one is to get it all out of the way. So 
16 we're finished with, for the most part, with any 
17 kind of interviews with that. 
18 I can't control whether anybody shows up 
19 outside and just hangs outside the doors and all of 
20 that. If there is a protest scheduled or the media 
21 is going to be here. We will work with that again. 
22 We will know who is there and what's there and all 
23 of that. If need be, get you in and get you out of 
24 the building without worrying about any of that.

1 coming in, don't wear the grand jury badge and that 
2 will, won't tip anybody off that you are on the 
3 grand jury, we will have all of that stuff. 
4 Am I missing anything? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Note taking. 5 
6 MR. MCCULLOCH: Oh, you are right. Note 
7 taking. You take, as you know, all the notes that 
8 you want. Write down anything and everything. If a 
9 thought occurs to you, you want to talk to the 
10 witness, take all the notes that you want. The 
11 notes, of course, can't leave here. They are your 
12 notes and your notes alone. 
13 Fellow grand jurors won't see your notes 
14 and you won't see their notes. At the end of the 
15 day or end of the session, the notes will be 
16 collected and they will be secured. Any evidence 
17 that is presented to you, physical evidence, of 
18 course, also will be collected and it will be 
19 secured. We have highly secure evidence lockers 
20 within the complex here. All of that will be that. 
21 At the end of that, you can use your notes 
22 for any deliberation when everything is finished. 
23 At the end, just so you know, there are going to be 
24 massive amounts of information and physical items 
25 that are coming here in the next month. You're not

1 going to remember everything. The witness today 
2 testifies, you're not going to remember that a month 
3 from now, but all of that and the transcripts will 
4 all be available and you'll have as long as you 
5 need, as long as you want to go through everything 
6 again before you start your deliberations. While 
7 you are doing deliberations, all of that is 
8 available. 
9 Unlike a trial jury where you have to send 
10 a note out to the judge and the judge would decide 
11 if you get something or you don't get something, 
12 that rule doesn't apply here. Everything will be 
13 here in the room with you and you will have access 
14 to all of it. You, of course, have access to your 
15 notes throughout all of that. 
16 At the end of all of that, you won't have 
17 access to those notes, is that it? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I want to say that what Bob 
19 said, everything is going to be recorded in this 
20 room while we're presenting this case. That, of 
21 course, doesn't include your deliberations, those 
22 will not be recorded. And when we have juries who 
23 are hearing evidence in trial, typically the jury, 
24 not typically, always the jury is told prior to 
25 trial to keep an open mind throughout the entire

1 process, don't form any opinions until you've heard 
2 all of the evidence. 
3 There's no requirement that you all can't 
4 talk about things amongst yourselves. So if there 
5 is something that you all talk about and decide, we 
6 would like to hear from this person or you have a 
7 question about us bringing another witness in, you 
8 all can discuss that amongst yourselves so long as 
9 you are not deliberating and starting to form 
10 opinions until you have heard everything, okay. 
11 So there will be times for you all when 
12 there is no recording going on, where you all can 
13 discuss your schedule, you know, when we might meet 
14 again, and if there's any questions that you have 
15 that you want us to try to provide the answer for. 
16 Again, as Bob said, Sheila and I can't 
17 answer other than just procedural things or 
18 questions of law. But if there is some question 
19 that you have, if we can find somebody who can 
20 answer that question for you, we will do so, we'll 
21 try to bring somebody in to answer those questions, 
22 okay?

24 do need, and I know you will keep an open mind on 
25 everything. You haven't heard a single thing yet

1 other than what has been in the media, believe me 
2 that's not evidence. Don't form any opinion on 
3 anything that you've heard, good, bad or ugly in the 
4 media. 
5 Everything that's been collected, every 
6 statement that has ever been made, it will all be 
7 here for you. You need to keep that open mind to 
8 give everybody, including the entire community, a 
9 full and as open as it can be, but certainly as 
10 thorough and as expedient of all the evidence that 
11 you can. 
12 I know people keep talking about the 
13 transparency, at the end of all of this, depending 
14 on your determination, as other cases, if there are 
15 charges that you find should be lodged and are 
16 lodged, then all of that information will come out 
17 pursuant to the course of the case. There are rules 
18 that apply then as to how things are handled and all 
19 of that. It doesn't come out right away because you 
20 can't prejudice a potential jury panel. So all of 
21 that evidence, just like here, is presented to a 
22 trial jury in the courtroom and not put out in the 
23 media. So everybody can see it and then make their 
24 mind up before they ever come into a courtroom.

4 deliberations aren't, as I said, your deliberations 
5 are not recorded and never will be recorded, notes 
6 won't be released, but every bit of evidence that 
7 you have, the testimony of the witnesses who come 
8 in, the statements of the witnesses, the physical 
9 evidence, the photographs, everything that you have 
10 seen and heard will be released to the public. That 
11 is as transparent as we can get short of putting a 
12 pool TV camera in here and that's not going to 
13 happen. 
14 It is, obviously, an awesome burden, but 
15 it is going to be an awful lot of work and we will 
16 make it as orderly and organized as we can to you. 
17 As I said, if there is anything at all 
18 that we can do to do that, working with your 
19 schedules, work longer, we have no set hours. So 
20 whatever it takes, we will get that to you. We 
21 don't want to rush through anything, but we also 
22 don't want to drag it out. 
23 I'm anticipating, in all honesty, without 
24 basing it on a whole lot, that we hope to have this 
25 completed by the middle of October. It doesn't mean

12 MR. MCCULLOCH: We are in the hope that 
13 all 12 of you are perfect, healthy specimens, who 
14 have no plans to leave town or go on vacation for 
15 two months. All 12 will hear everything and the 
16 only way we have alternates is to have them in here 
17 at the time and we do that at a trial, but here it 
18 is just, it doesn't work in the grand jury. So we 
19 have all 12 when we can get all 12 of you together. 
20 If we can only get 11 together, we are 
21 going to have to find a different time. I hope 
22 everybody can be as flexible as possible, and again, 
23 we will be as flexible as possible. We have no set 
24 hours. Every day is Monday, weekends, whatever 
25 works for you is when we are going to be here.

15 is Sheila only having this witness or Kathi is

4 have any special tools that you take with you? 
5 A We have cameras and things to establish 
6 the time of death, and other equipment that we 
7 collect evidence. 
8 Q Okay. So tell us what a medical examiner 
9 does once, well, first of all, how do you get the 
10 call? 
11 A Usually a police officer or hospital or 
12 paramedic will call us and let us know there is a 
13 deceased person.

15 must follow? I know the person is always deceased

3 up the body. 
4 Q Do you call the delivery service when you 
5 get the call? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q Once you get there? 
8 A No, once I get the call, I call them to 
9 let them know what is going on, where it is at. 
10 Q They meet you there? 
11 A Right. 
12 Q So at the scene once you arrive, what do 
13 you do? Like take us through an investigation. 
14 A I try to meet the reporting officer, speak 
15 to him, find out what happened. They go and look at 
16 the body and see if everything is consistent with 
17 what he told me or whatever witnesses told him, and 
18 then I come back and I would talk to the family or 
19 one of the witnesses if they were there.

21 necessarily the people who directly saw the

1 scene tape up, and a crowd has gathered, quite a few 
2 people there. He was deceased, was laying in the 
3 middle of the street. There was already some orange 
4 barriers around him to keep the crowd from seeing 
5 him. 
6 Q Was the crowd saying anything? 
7 A They were just, I don't know how to 
8 explain it. I guess voicing their concerns at what 
9 is going on, why is this taking so long, things of 
10 that nature.

A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Do you know what that meant? 
I assume the body was laying out there too 
21 long, they didn't like the body being out there. 
22 Q When you arrived, tell us what it looked 
23 like, the body, was it covered, uncovered? 
24 A He was covered with several white sheets 
25 laying in the prone position.

Okay. What did you do? 
When I was able to go to the body? 
Yes. 
I went over there with the police 
9 officers, the ID officers, we removed the sheets, 
10 took photographs of his back, lifted up the shirt, 
11 took more photographs. Then we rolled him over, I 
12 placed white clean sheets down on the ground and 
13 rolled him over onto those. Took more photographs, 
14 documented the injuries, looked through his pockets, 
15 looked through his pants for any weapons or anything 
16 of that nature. 
17 And then got some clean paper bags, 
18 placed them on his hands and then we put him back on 
19 the sheet and into a white bag and sealed it up.

13 if I was a medical examiner, I told her I was. She 
14 asked me why the body was still on the street, why 
15 is it taking so long. 
16 I explained to her, you know, it 
17 takes a thorough investigation and crowd control, 
18 just getting everybody into the scene was taking 
19 time to do that and once everybody is here, we can 
20 get our information that we need and the evidence 
21 collected and then we can be out of here. Once 
22 everything starts, it doesn't take long.

Anything? 
In looking at the report, I would like to 
8 clarify, the east and west position of the body may 
9 not be accurate, may not be correct. I was just 
10 going by the street that I came in on, that I came 
11 down. It should have been an east and west street. 
12 So that should have been west and his feet should 
13 have been east. 
14 Sometimes in a subdivision the 
15 streets, they curve, so his head may be a little bit 
16 off. Like southwest, and his feet may be northeast 
17 or something in a different report, but I should say 
18 that the head was pointing towards Florissant and 
19 his feet was, what's the name of the other street, 
20 the other main intersection that I came in on to get 
21 to Canfield.

9 A Cases like, maybe on this kind of case 
10 like this, maybe the doctor asked us what was he 
11 doing before this happened. I would have to go 
12 back, contact an officer, maybe his family and find 
13 out why he was with so and so doing something or you 
14 know, whatever he was doing prior to his death. I 
15 may have to go back and get that information.

MS. WHIRLEY: Okay yes, ma'am. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'm trying to get a 
8 clarification. You said that the police officers 
9 had already examined the body, photoing the body, 
10 taking pictures of everything on the body. 
11 Let me understand, when you examined the 
12 body, you searched the pockets and you found the 
13 marijuana, the two $5 bills and the two lighters. 
14 Why wouldn't those objects be outside the pockets if 
15 they had already examined the body? 
16 A They don't actually examine, they just 
17 take photographs. They don't touch the body until I 
18 get there and I can't touch the body until the 
19 detectives get there. We kind of do it in tandem. 
20 We don't want to disturb the scene. They come in 
21 and they photograph everything like it is. I come 
22 in, if I move anything, then they photograph it 
23 again. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: What's the purpose of doing 
25 it in tandem and not the police?

3 around and we all have different information then. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: There is information that 
5 the body may be able to tell the medical examiner or

conversation with Sergeant

? 
18 Approximately 1:30 p.m. 
19 you had a conversation with him to set up a time 
20 when you were to arrive at the scene?

1 you called, but you said you arrived at the scene at 
2 about 2:30 approximately your time. Now, I 
3 understand you stated that after you got to the 
4 scene then you had to wait another hour, is that my 
5 understanding? 
6 A Yes, ma'am, approximately about another 
7 hour. 
8 So actually your 
9 investigation didn't start until about 3:30 p.m. 
10 that day? 
11 
12

13 that hour?

16 make their placards, grab all of their little place 
17 cards and find evidence on the scene, mark the 
18 evidence, lay it there, take photographs of it. 
19 A lot of time you have to clear out a 
20 way, a path for me to get to the body. I'll be 
21 walking through there kicking shell casings and 
22 different evidence around. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: So all of that was 
24 occurring?

3 several officers. Some transcribe, some give out 
4 measurements, some photograph, you have a 
5 transcriber with the photographer. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: This was St. Louis County on

9 MS. WHIRLEY: It is your understanding 
10 that Ferguson was on the scene first?

16 Were paramedics 
17 called initially do you know to, you know, the first 
18 instance, did they do anything to the body? 
19 A I don't know if they were called or not. 
20 I know they arrived on scene shortly after it 
21 happened. I looked at the body, they didn't have no 
22 leads, any kind of what they usually do is put a 
23 lead on their body for EKGs to see if there is any 
24 kind of heartbeats. None of that was placed on 
25 there. Everything from there on is going to be

15 observed was actually a fatal wound.

17 So in 25 years

14 ask a question because we don't know how well this 
15 is all picking up until we listen to this later or 
16 have an opportunity to check it, so if you would 
17 make, you don't have to get right up on it, but make 
18 an effort to kind of speak into the microphone so 
19 that we can be sure that your questions are 
20 recorded, that would be great. If I see you not 
21 doing that because you are not used to it, I might 
22 say, could you get close to the mike, okay.

Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And in your report, 
5 did you make those notes? 
6 A No, ma'am.

9 body?

A 
A 
Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Why not? 
At the time where they were at and they 
21 were still being processed, I guess let the police 
22 take care of that part. They are trying to figure 
23 out what shots were fired and what order, I didn't 
24 see no reason to see where they were at.

1 shells kind of determine how the body was shot, what 
2 angle, how far, the distance? 
3 A They could at times. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: That's not what you are 
5 qualified to figure out? 
6 A Correct. I don't know if they were moved, 
7 kicked around, people trampled through there, things 
8 of that nature. And the semiautomatic weapon, are 
9 the shell casings going to go out to the right side 
10 and eject. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And so your 
12 purpose in being there and your function is to 
13 assist the medical examiner in doing their job? 
14 
15 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You're not there as a 
16 police agent or an agent of any police department? 
17 A Correct. As a matter of fact, my mission 
18 is just for the body. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the medical 
20 examiner? 
21 A Correct. 
22 Whose 
23 responsibility is it to write the whole report 
24 overview of that at the scene, is that the police 
25 department? Obviously, it is not this individual.

Police department. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I anticipate you will be 
3 hearing testimony from the investigators who do 
4 document the crime scene in any kind of crime scene 
5 and especially such as this, there is going to be 
6 probably a number of officers who were doing 
7 different things at the crime scene to process the 
8 scene. 
9 A This crime scene, can I say something? 
10 The crime scene was huge, he's here, some of his 
11 shoes are farther away from him. You have a vehicle 
12 and his hat, it may stretch out 100 yards. I'm just 
13 there for the body. Just trying to let our 
14 pathologist know he's here, there are other things 
15 there, this is what's going on with the body. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: It is your job to take the 
17 body when you leave? 
18 A Correct. And the police will come in and 
19 photograph everything else, document it where it is 
20 at and take their notes. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: 
22 You mentioned 
23 before that when you arrived at the scene and you 
24 saw the body for the first time, he was in the 
25 middle of the road, is that my understanding?

5 wounds were. 
6 A But on these I couldn't, that's why I 
7 didn't. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
9 The abrasions 
10 that you noticed, were they consistent with where he 
11 would have made contact when he hit the ground with 
12 his forehead and left hand or could that have been 
13 caused by some earlier altercation or something. 
14 A To me it looked like it came from the 
15 ground, that is more of an assumption. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Why does it look like it 
17 came from the ground? 
18 A Because it looked more like a road rash 
19 abrasion as opposed to an altercation abrasion, like 
20 somebody scratching him. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: What's an altercation 
22 abrasion. 
23 A Like somebody punches you in the eye, you 
24 may get a slight, like somebody's knuckles sliding 
25 across your face.

8 Just to be 
9 clear, the fact that you didn't take pictures, you

14 because you didn't have the pictures?

16 would have taken them too. A lot of times we direct
