GRAND JURY VOLUME VIII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is Tuesday, 
5 September 30th at 8:32 a.m. Present is myself, 
6 Kathi Alizadeh, and Sheila Whirley of St. Louis 
Page 5 
7 County Prosecutor's Office. All 12 grand jurors are 
8 present as well as the court reporter, who is audio 
9 recording and taking down everything that is being 
10 said this morning. 
11 I want to give a little pep talk to you as 
12 it were. I can only imagine the disruption that 
13 this causes in all of your lives and schedules, and 
14 I hope you know how appreciative that we are that we 
15 have the 12 of you who have agreed, even though 
16 maybe your arms were twisted a little bit, but 
17 agreed to, you know, devote the time and effort that 
18 this matter takes. 
19 Don't think I'm understating it or 
20 overstating it to say how important this is. And I 
21 know you all, you know, since you're not a jury, 
22 there is no admonition that you not watch the news 
23 and anything like that, and I know that you can't 
24 really avoid seeing things about this in the news 
25 and, you know, not only here locally, but as well

1 throughout the country. This is a very public 
2 matter and it is very important that we get this 
3 right. 
4 And, as you know, Mr. McCulloch made a 
5 statement in the very beginning we were going to be 
6 as thorough as possible. And that means anybody who 
7 says that they saw part of this or knows something 
8 about it, is going to be able to be heard. 
9 Even people that are reluctant to come in, 
10 we're going to do whatever we can to get them here 
11 because it is important that you have all the facts 
12 and information. 
13 And I know sometimes it seems like it is 
14 very tedious because some of these eyewitnesses have 
15 made multiple statements and again, Mr. McCulloch 
16 has promised that there wasn't going to be anything 
17 that you didn't have the opportunity or weren't able 
18 to see or hear, and that means playing all of these 
19 statements for you. 
20 And we do that because, obviously, there 
21 is times when if a witness makes multiple 
22 statements, sometimes over time their statements 
23 changes, sometimes dramatically, sometimes only 
24 slightly and insignificantly, but I think that those 
25 are things that you all have a right to consider

1 when the witness testifies, if they've made previous 
2 statements that are different than what maybe they 
3 are telling you in the grand jury. 
4 That happens in every case, every time a 
5 witness makes a prior statement, that statement can 
6 be brought up, as you know well, you said this 
7 previously, how come you are changing your story. 
8 And, you know, neither Sheila and I are 
9 prepping these witnesses in the way we would if we 
10 were having a trial. We try cases, we have our 
11 witnesses come in and we talk to them about what is 
12 going to happen, we go over what their testimony is 
13 going to be, not in the sense like rehearsing, we 
14 want to know what they're going to say before they 
15 get up there and testify. 
16 And that's just good lawyering. No one 
17 would ever expect me to put on a witness in a trial 
18 when I didn't know what they were going to say. 
19 But in this case, you know, we don't want 
20 to have to, we don't want to in any way influence 
21 what these people are going to come forward and say 
22 to you. And so we don't do any prepping with any of 
23 these witnesses, other than to explain to them what 
24 is going to happen when they come in here, the 
25 process. So I don't know what they're going to say

1 when they get here. 
2 I mean, I have an idea because they've 
3 made prior statements, I assume they are going to 
4 say something like they said before, but the reality 
5 is, I don't know, and that's why it is important 
6 that we play for you those prior statements so that 
7 you know what they have said previously and can 
8 compare that to what they say today when they 
9 testify. 
10 A lot of times, I know it is tedious and 
11 it seems redundant, why are we hearing this person 
12 say the same thing now three times. 
13 If the person makes the same statement 
14 three times, you may consider that when you are 
15 deliberating about how that, what that means for 
16 that person's credibility, their ability to have 
17 observed what they say they saw and recall what they 
18 say they saw. Those were all things that I think 
19 are important because there are a lot of people that 
20 see bits and pieces of what happened that day, and I 
21 think you can even see right now how, you know, 
22 depending on where you were standing, it affects 
23 what maybe you say you saw, and that's human nature 
24 too. 
25 So, again, Sheila and I are not worried,

1 but very, we're concerned about the speed that this 
2 is coming in. We're going to do our best to try to 
3 kick it up if we can. 
4 A lot of these eyewitnesses you are going 
5 to hear from who have made multiple statements, we 
6 expect that hopefully that's going to be less and 
7 less and eventually, you know, we'll get through the 
8 eyewitnesses, and then you are going to hear from 
9 ballistics people, and lab people, and DNA people, 
10 and, of course, those witnesses don't have prior 
11 recorded statements that we'll have to present to 
12 you. They may have reports that you will get copies 
13 of, but at any rate, I know that this is tedious. I 
14 know you want your lives back, your lives back the 
15 way they were. 
16 All I can tell you is that this will be 
17 over at some point, this is not indefinite, and 
18 we're doing everything we can to try to get through 
19 this as quickly as possible. 
20 We were hearing the other day that there 
21 is rumors that you all are going to be done this 
22 week. I'm here to tell you, no, that's not 
23 happening. 
24 Originally, we had made estimates we would 
25 get done about the end of October, early November.

2 As I said in the beginning, if this takes 
3 until January for you all to have what you need to 
4 make this decision, then that's what we're going to 
5 have to do. 
6 We'll do it as quickly as we can without 
7 rushing through it and skipping through things that 
8 need to be done. 
9 So that being said, I truly, truly 
10 apologize for the disruption in your lives. You all 
11 really seem to be a great group of people, I'm so 
12 glad you all get along as you do, it would be awful 
13 if we had people that, you know, had conflicts and 
14 bickering going on. You all seem to be, as best as 
15 you can, hanging in there with us. 
16 So, again, Sheila and I thank you for your 
17 patience. So that being said, yes. 
18 I have a 
19 question. I try not to watch the news, I try not to 
20 read anything about this because I like to have an 
21 open mind so I have all the facts that is presented 
22 here. 
23 My concern is that, urn, my concern is that 
24 everybody is saying hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, 
25 from what I'm hearing. Hurry up, make a decision,

1 hurry up and get this done, hurry up and get that

3 And I know that this information has been 
4 disseminated. I know Mr. McCulloch before has said 
5 there is a process and this is the process that we 
6 have to follow. 
7 Is the NAACP, or these other, you know, 
8 coalitions, are they confirming what he is saying to 
9 the people of Ferguson? I mean, I don't know if you 
10 can comment on that, but. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, all I can tell you 
12 I think everybody needs to 
13 rachet it down a little bit and let us do what we 
14 can do. I have faith and trust in everybody in 
15 here, you know, to make the decision that's 
16 appropriate. I'm not saying it is the right 
17 decision, I'm not saying it is the wrong decision, 
18 but make the decision that's appropriate based on 
19 the facts. But is that being disseminated by these 
20 groups or whatever to the people there? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, there has been, as I 
22 said, there have been rumors, I think there was 
23 someone who had tweeted yesterday, a person of 
24 public, a public person that, you know, I hear 
25 unverified rumor the grand jury is going to have

1 their decision by Friday. I don't know where they 
2 get this stuff. I don't know where that comes from, 
3 but I know that last week and yesterday 
4 Mr. McCulloch did give interviews to the media. 
5 Last week he gave interviews to several 
6 media outlets describing the process. The fact how 
7 a grand jury is selected, you know. 
8 My office has nothing to do with how you 
9 all are selected. The fact that you were selected 
10 way before this even, you know, happened, you know. 
11 And then the process of how, you know, when you have 
12 regular lives, this is not like a jury in a trial 
13 where Monday through Friday from 8:00 to 5:00 you 
14 are going to be here until it is done. That's not 
15 how it works. In a trial that's how it work, I 
16 mean. 
17 We have jurors that we have to tell them 
18 in advance this is going to be a two-week trial, 
19 this is going to be a three-week trial. But he has 
20 made those statements and, you know, I can't, I 
21 can't help what goes around in the rumor mill. I 
22 don't think we have much control over that. 
23 But I will express to him those thoughts 
24 that if any wisdom in trying to bring together some 
25 of the people in the various communities who can

1 disseminate that message that, you know, be patient. 
2 I mean, there is that catch phrase people 
3 always talk about, rush to judgment. That was a 
4 phrase made popular years ago. People keep saying 
5 hurry up, hurry up. We're not going to rush to 
6 judgment here. 
7 If we wanted to, we could present this 
8 case as we do any other case. We could have a 
9 detective come in here and tell you what he thinks, 
10 you know, the evidence is, and then you all would be 
11 making your own decision based on that, but that's 
12 not how we've chosen to do this because of the 
13 importance of letting all sides be heard in this 
14 matter. 
15 So I will talk to Mr. McCulloch about the 
16 strategy behind that, that it might be, because we 
17 all want everybody to just calm down. It will 
18 happen, there will be an answer, but you have to be 
19 patient, you have to let the grand jury do their 
20 job, you have to let us do our job. 
21 And, you know, the problem is too, we 
22 can't tell people how often you're meeting, what 
23 days you're meeting, how many witnesses are 
24 testifying, because we're prohibited from talking 
25 about that.

1 And so when people ask questions how often 
2 are they meeting or how many hours a week or how 
3 many witnesses are they hearing from, we can't 
4 answer those questions. 
5 I think just the fact that the questions 
6 are asked and we can't answer it, I wonder if that 
7 might create even more like, well, why aren't you 
8 telling us this. 
9 So I will talk to him and maybe we'll kick 
10 that around and we meet daily, except for these 
11 days. We usually don't meet on these days, but we 
12 meet pretty much every day and talk about what's 
13 going on and how we are progressing. 
14 And so yes, 
15 I'm going to 
16 piggyback on her question. I've heard a lot of 
17 people talking about, this is people who should 
18 know, talking about why don't they just arrest him, 
19 and then figure out what's going on, why don't they 
20 just take action, do they not understand the 
21 process? Is that the problem, or is there a way to 
22 bypass this because it seems to me that we're doing 
23 what needs to be done and we're doing what's right 
24 and people are not seeing that.

9 going to talk about it. I don't want to talk about

13 know, we're working hard and so it is just going to 
14 take a while before this process is completed.

16 watching the news and everything, I don't watch the 
17 news. I truly don't. I watch the news in the 
18 morning so I can see what the weather is, if there 
19 is like a traffic accident on the highway on my way 
20 in so I need to go a different route. 
21 I don't want to see what's going on, even 
22 though I know it's there and I hear about it, 
23 because, number one, I just need to have a little,

Last 
11 night on the news, I know you just said you don't 
12 watch the news, it was stated that Officer Wilson 
13 had a case pending, a previous case pending. My 
14 question is, how much does that affect what we're 
15 going through? 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: It shouldn't affect what 
17 you have. I was aware of that. Simply because I 
18 saw some cameras out yesterday, and I saw an 
19 attorney that was commenting about it and I heard 
20 about what it was. 
21 But, you know, up until August 9th, he was 
22 an on duty police officer who made traffic stops and 
23 arrests and did other things other police officers 
24 do and so I would imagine, I've not looked, but I 
25 would imagine he has pending cases in our office.

1 How those are handled and what comes of 
2 those cases shouldn't be your concern. I will tell 
3 you that I do not believe, and I will look into

19 First statement was done on August 12th, and it was 
20 done by the County Police. 
21 And, remember, as I said a lot of times 
22 when the police do a statement, then the FBI has to 
23 come along and do their own statement, so after we 
24 hear the statement by the County Police, we will 
25 hear a statement that was done by the FBI.

6 Well, actually, as I just 
7 stated to them, from my porch I can only see from 
8 the passenger side. 
9 Okay. 
10 I don't know if he had 
11 grabbed him or what, but you could see them tussling 
12 in the car, they were moving around. 
13 When you say he grabbed him --
14 I don't know who grabbed who. 
15 I know. When you say he? 
16 The police officer. 
17 Okay. 
18 Because he was walking, he 
19 must have said something to him and he was 
20 approaching the truck. Then we saw the tussling. 
21 Let me ask you, you said he 
22 must have said something to him, you mean --
23 I think the officer said 
24 something to him because Michael started walking 
25 towards the truck.

2 to ask you, what made you say, when you say he, I'm 
3 trying to figure out. 
4 I'll make sure I state it. 
5 Okay. I know when you use the 
6 expression he must have said something, that's one 
7 of those assumptions. When you say that, I want to 
8 you to explain that's why you are making that 
9 assumption. 
10 Well, I'm assuming he said it 
11 because he was approaching the car. I mean, if the 
12 officer tells me to stop and come here, I'm coming 
13 there, okay. 
14 Okay. 
15 I'm going to approach you, I 
16 want to talk to you. I'm going to find what is 
17 going on. 
18 That's fine, that makes sense. 
19 But I could see them 
20 tussling, you know, and after that is when the first 
21 shot rang out. 
22 Let me ask you about the 
23 tussling specifically. I know you said from what 
24 your vantage point was, can you describe from your 
25 vantage point what Michael Brown's position was?

He was outside the car door. 
Okay. 
Outside the truck door. He 
4 was in one of those big 4x4, not 4x4, SUVs. 
5 Right. 
6 He was on the outside and the 
7 officer was still in the truck. 
8 And how is Michael Brown's 
9 body? 
10 He was like, he was, I could 
11 see the top of his head, he had a hat on. 
12 Okay. 
13 I could see the top of his 
14 head, and then he dropped down and he disappeared 
15 for a minute. Next time I saw his head is when I 
16 heard the shot, that's when he popped up. 
17 Okay. 
18 Okay. 
19 Were you able to see from your 
20 vantage point whether Michael Brown's body was bent 
21 over --
22 From my vantage point I can 
23 say clearly he was not inside that truck. He was 
24 partially, maybe his head, was right there at the 
25 officer's head.

11 Okay. 
12 I could see his body, see his 
13 torso, I could see maybe from like the shoulders up, 
14 jostling around like they are moving back and forth 
15 like this, just like some kind of tug of war or 
16 something was going on. 
17 Okay. Just for the recording

6 Right. He took a step to the 
7 street. It looked like he was giving up. Because 
8 that is what we were saying. He is giving up, he is 
9 giving up, you know, we're looking at him, he's 
10 giving up. But then as soon as he took a step, he 
11 got his foot in the street, he fired three shots. 
12 All right. Let me ask you 
13 about when you said he had his hand up. You had 
14 described previously that he was standing, as you 
15 said, his hands up around where the shoulders were, 
16 his palms were facing him. 
17 No, they were like this. 
18 Palms are facing the officer, they were like this.

20 Okay. 
21 You are the police officer, I 
22 turned around and I did like this.

Okay. Show your palms are out? 
Right, right.

1 understand. From my understanding when the police 
2 were interviewed by the County Police, you described 
3 he kind of stopped and looked down to his right? 
4 When he stopped at this time, 
5 yes. He kind of, when he stepped off, he was still 
6 like this, but he had his hands up, he was still 
7 trying to find out where he was shot to me. 
8 And then tell me what makes you 
9 say that? 
10 Because he looked down to his 
11 side. 
12 Okay. You said his right side? 
13 Yeah, this side, yeah, 
14 looking on this right side and then he took a step 
15 out. And he had his hands up and as soon as he took 
16 that step and got to street, maybe about to, he is a 
17 big guy, he could have made it about three steps. 
18 Let me ask you this, when he's 
19 running, he stops in front of the driveway. Based 
20 upon your vantage point, you think that he stopped 
21 because he was looking at to see where he was shot? 
22 Yes. 
23 Okay. So when he did that, at 
24 that moment he stopped, where were his hands 
25 initially?

Like this, he had them like 
2 this. He took them away from his body to see, he 
3 was like looking, he was looking. 
4 All right. That's a little bit 
5 different --
6 No, I told it before, I said 
7 when he stopped he was looking, he was like this, 
8 his hands were not steady like this, but he had them 
9 up to look at because he's a big guy, he had to look 
10 and see what was up. 
11 He was like moving his arms. 
12 Moving his arms to see what 
13 was going on. 
14 You have your palms sort of 
15 facing you like he was checking --
16 Right, he's checking out his 
17 own body. 
18 Okay. 
19 Okay. But when he turned to 
20 face the officer he was like this. He had his hands 
21 up, palm facing the officer like, okay, you got me. 
22 He had already told him to stop. 
23 All right. I need to just go 
24 back and try and (inaudible) a little bit. When he 
25 was checking out his body, were you able to see?

2 Is there anything that stood 
3 out to you? 
4 Nothing stood out to me. 
5 Okay. 
6 You know. 
7 And so when he turned around 
8 and took that step is when he had his palms out? 
9 Right. 
10 So right after that when the 
11 officer started shooting, what did Michael Brown do? 
12 After he fired that first 
13 round, that first volley. He hit him, he started 
14 staggering, he first kind of went back like, pow, 
15 from the impact. 
16 Okay. 
17 And then he started 
18 staggering. And he was looking at the officer as he 
19 brought his head up, he looked down, oh, God, I've 
20 been shot. He looked up at the officer and he was 
21 looking at him and he was staggering, he was trying 
22 to stay on his feet. And myself and my family is 
23 telling him stop, dude, stop, stop, stop. 
24 Were you actually saying that

1 Yes, he couldn't hear us, you 
2 know, from where we live. 
3 I know he couldn't hear you, 
4 but were you actually yelling it in hopes? 
5 Hoping that he would hear but 
6 he was staggering. We could see that he was 
7 staggering and he took about, I don't know, three or 
8 four more steps, but as he was taking his steps 
9 forward at that time, the officer took a few steps 
10 back, he was still in his spot. When Michael took 
11 the other steps and he was staggering, his body was 
12 like -- can I stand up, please? 
13 Yeah, absolutely. 
14 Okay. He was standing up, he 
15 was shot. He was leaning like this, but his head 
16 was like this. And he was standing up staggering, 
17 he was trying to stay up on his feet like this. 
18 Okay. 
19 And he was definitely, we 
20 were yelling at him stop, stop, stop. My 
21 sister-in-law and said, oh, God, he's 
22 getting ready to kill him, he's getting ready to 
23 kill him. And no sooner than he said that, no 
24 sooner those words came out of their mouth, he was 
25 going down, it looks like he was going down. And he

2 Okay. When the officer was 
3 shooting was when Michael Brown was coming towards 
4 him; is that right? 
5 Yeah, he was not charging 
6 him, he was defenseless, hands up, he was trying to 
7 stay on his feet and you could see that his knees 
8 was beginning to buckle, he was going down. When he 
9 shot him as he was going down, he hit face first, 
10 splat. 
11 Where were his arms when he 
12 fell to the ground? You are showing arms at either 
13 side of his head? 
14 When his body hit is when I 
15 ran up there his arm, one was like, I can't exactly 
16 tell on the body, one was like this when he hit 
17 down. I guess they moved when he hit the ground, 
18 but he was dead on the way down. 
19 Can you picture where his arms 
20 were on the ground?

1 I didn't really want to see it, you know, because 
2 when I ran up there and I saw who it was, I'm like, 
3 oh, my God. I just saw him earlier this morning. 
4 I'll get to that in a second,

6 two volleys of shots --
7 Right. 
8 Correct? 
9 Right. 
10 Each time the officer was 
11 firing, Michael Brown was coming towards him? 
12 Yes. 
13 Okay. And at no time did 
14 Michael Brown say anything, correct? 
15 I could not tell or hear if 
16 he did say anything. 
17 You didn't hear him yell, don't

19 No, I didn't. 
20 Were you able to hear the

12 Michael Brown? 
13 No. 
14 From your vantage point, you 
15 didn't see his mouth moving as though he was saying 
16 anything? 
17 My eyes was really focused on 
18 the officer because when he started moving, 
19 staggering forward, I wanted to see what he was 
20 getting read to do cause everybody was like, he is 
21 getting ready to kill him. 
22 Okay. 
23 So I wanted to see what he 
24 was getting ready to do, but Michael was staggering.

2 fired again and that's when I said, oh, my God, he 
3 just killed him. 
4 Okay. So I just want to 
5 (inaudible), when this was all happening, your 
6 attention shifted to the officer, correct? 
7 I could still see Michael, I 
8 wanted to see what he was going to do. I had both 
9 of them in line of sight. 
10 Okay. Is it fair to say that 
11 Michael was more, just based on how you are 
12 describing it and the visual you just gave me, is it 
13 fair to say that Michael was more in your peripheral 
14 vision at that point? 
15 Both of them, both of them. 
16 From my vantage point, I can see both, okay. But to 
17 say, now I'm trying to make this as clear as I can. 
18 I can see both of them, but as Michael was 
19 staggering toward him, you know, trying to keep his 
20 balance, as he was moving forward, you could see, I 
21 could see the officer stepping back. 
22 When he took those steps back and Michael 
23 was staggering forward, I thought, oh, my God, 
24 that's when they said he is getting ready to shoot 
25 him. Sure enough, as soon they said that, he let

9 On August 12th, I want to take you 
10 through what you said at that time. 
11 You said as he faces the officer, this is 
12 Detective asking you this, as he faces the 
13 officer, you say that his hands go up to a point 
14 where you said about to his shoulders almost. 
15 Right. 
16 That's when he has his palms 
17 sort of facing himself and he's looking over his 
18 body? 
19 When he got first shot and he 
20 got to the driveway, his hands were up facing 
21 himself because he was looking like at himself.

1 to the shoulder, that's when he went up facing the 
2 officer. 
3 Okay. You went on to say 
4 back on August the 12th, Detective says, your 
5 arms are like palms up and hands and fingers are 
6 roughly shoulder height, is that fair enough to say? 
7 You say yeah, about close to his shoulder. 
8 Do you agree with that? 
9 Yeah, yes. 
10 With his palms facing 
11 towards himself like this? 
12 No, not turned, his hands are 
13 like this. 
14 No, I'm talking about --
15 They're not, excuse me, what 
16 you are saying, the hands are pointed toward him, 
17 they were not, I didn't say they were pointed toward 
18 him. I said his hands were like this. I described 
19 it. I didn't say they were pointed toward him. The 
20 only time I said his hands was anywhere near is when 
21 he first got shot. 
22 When he turned, they were this way.

10 right? 
11 Oh, yeah. 
12 And you say he is standing 
13 there, he looks, he looks down looking at his body. 
14 That's where you're saying you thought he was 
15 looking to see if he was shot? 
16 Right. 
17 Okay. And then after that, 
18 you go on to say that Detective asked you, 
19 Michael Brown is standing facing the officer at this 
20 point with his hands at his rib cage. And you say, 
21 yeah. 
22 And Detective says hands, palms up, 
23 like at his rib cage.

6 Detective says hands, palms up, and 
7 you say uh-huh. Is that the way you recall it 
8 today? 
9 Yeah. 
10 And you go on to say, or 
11 Detective asked you, and he was looking down 
12 at his body at some point. You already told him he 
13 was looking down at his body. Detective 
14 says, he was looking down at his body at some point, 
15 and you say right, right, uh-huh. Okay. All right. 
16

18 
Is that the way recall it? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Just to be clear too, 
19 we talked about when you thought that the officer 
20 must have said something to Michael Brown because 
21 Michael Brown then approached the vehicle, that's 
22 when you saw the tussle. 
23 So you actually saw Michael Brown come to 
24 the side of the vehicle, he approached the side of 
25 the vehicle?

13 sort of were very clear about where everyone was. 
14 But she had asked you about when the officer went 
15 after Michael, where was his gun at that time, or 
16 could you see it. And you corrected her and said, 
17 well, he just went to the back of the vehicle and 
18 assumed his stance. 
19 When he came out from around, 
20 he must of already pulled it out of his holster as 
21 he was coming around. 
22 And that's what I'm 
23 wondering. Could you see that, could you see where 
24 the gun was before he assumed his stance? 
25 It was in his hand and he

3 up in a stance, it was in his hand. 
4 It was in his hand. 
5 You are directing like out 
6 by itself? 
7 Right. He's pulling it out 
8 and as he came around so he could get a line sight 
9 on Michael, he whipped his hand up, gun is already 
10 in his hand, put it in his palm and aimed. 
11 Shortly after that he said 
12 stop? 
13 He said stop. When he said 
14 stop, Michael had already stopped. 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 When he turned around, he 
17 said stop again. When Michael took another step, he 
18 said stop. As he hit the street, after he said 
19 stop, he fired. That's when he started staggering 
20 around. You could tell he got hit the way his body 
21 jerked, okay. And as he was coming forward, trying 
22 to keep his balance, I guess keep from falling, he 
23 couldn't stand. He was trying to get hisself in a 
24 position, I believe, so that he could stand up. 
25 As he took those steps, the officer took

1 about two, three steps back. As he did that at the 
2 same time, he yelled stop again. Michael was then, 
3 you could tell he was about ready to fall. At the 
4 angle of his body, torso practically straight, knees 
5 wobbly, but the torso was almost at a 45 degree 
6 angle, his hands are slowly coming down. 
7 His hands were coming down? 
8 Right, coming down. 
9 And he was bent toward the

15 back to what you said. Detective asked you 
16 where you describe exactly this point, Detective 
17 asked you, and where are his hands at this 
18 point. 
19 And you say, after he hit him with the 
20 three shots, they were down.

2 And you said, yeah, they, like they were

5 Is that the way you recall

7 Right. 
8 That was after three shots? 
9 After the three shots. 
10 Because he was going down? 
11 Yeah, he was hit. As he was 
12 coming forward, he was trying to maintain his 
13 balance. 
14 And I know this, I've been shot, all 
15 right. I've been shot in the leg, so I know how it 
16 is to try to get your balance. 
17 And as I try to make this perfectly clear, 
18 his torso was straight, knees wobbly, but his upper 
19 torso was bent and he was still, kept his focus on 
20 the officer. 
21 So to be clear, from your 
22 vantage point, and I don't want you, I know you were 
23 shot so you know how it feels to be wobbly. From 
24 what you could actually see, Michael Brown was 
25 focused on the officer, correct?

19 up. Okay. 
20 He was shot, he was hurt. He was trying 
21 to keep up on his feet. He wasn't going toward the 
22 officer to try to get to him. He was trying to 
23 stand up. He was trying to maintain hisself, but 
24 you could see his body was giving out. And the

5 going like this, his body was coming like this 
6 because he wasn't even looking and he fired. That's 
7 the only way he could have hit him in the head, the 
8 only way. He was already on his way down. The man 
9 was unarmed, you had already put three to four shots 
10 in his body. 
11 Granted, he is a big boy, but he was hurt, 
12 he was hurt. 
13 And this is the point right

15 Right.

17 stop? 
18 Right, right. When he fired 
19 off that last volley, he hit down face first. I've

21 anything like that in her life. My sister-in-law is

4 Yeah, we were standing, no.

21 I saw him talking to a couple officers, but he was 
22 talking to a plain clothes detective and a Ferguson

7 around and doing something on every building. And

saying all kind of things. And you talked about

1 fired and everything else, I came back down because 
2 the crowd was big, it grew in a split second. I 
3 walked down to the edge of my driveway and I looked 
4 over to see the building, I can see the building 
5 they are working on from my bedroom window. 
6 He was talking, as I said, he was talking 
7 to a detective because his car was parked up on the 
8 grass on my side of street. And another officer in 
9 uniform had on a blue shirt. I didn't see the 
10 insignias, but I'm just saying that because Ferguson 
11 wear that types of collar, that may be a Ferguson 
12 officer that I had not talked to that man at all 
13 that day. 
14 Okay. 
15 I did not speak to him. 
16 All right. Let's back up a 
17 little bit then. When you come down and there are 
18 people saying things that you didn't see, how 
19 quickly after those last shots were fired was that 
20 happening? I mean, where people were actual 
21 actually saying things like that? 
22 After he hit the ground, I 
23 would say it took at least about a minute. 
24 That's when the crowd starts 
25 to gather, it was like an instant?

16 him. Oh, you know, my God, yeah, he was screaming 
17 and hollering. And the officer is trying to calm 
18 him down.

11 What would happen to somebody 
12 like that? 
13 Oh, shoot, they'll jump you, 
14 they'll jump you. 
15 Do you think that's the general 
16 feeling there if someone say something to either us 
17 or the local police, goes against what they want, 
18 that they will go against them. 
19 I think now as it is getting 
20 longer in time, the majority of them in our 
21 neighborhood, my community, want the truth. It is 
22 that outside forces that are coming in. When they 
23 burnt that thing down yesterday, 80 percent of the 
24 people were from the city, not from there. Cars 
25 were coming in, the parking lots were full. That

Yes.

Oh, yes. 
What did you see? 
I was standing outside in the 
10 morning, I come out every morning, step out, try to 
11 smoke a cigarette outside. I stepped outside, there 
12 was a gray car and a red car, I mean, a white and 
13 black car, sorry, sitting there. A gray, dark gray, 
14 charcoal gray car pulled up there, now there's three 
15 of them. 
16 The first two, they were taking pictures. 
17 In fact, a girl was in the white car, she got out 
18 and stood on the driver's side, took a couple 
19 pictures, got in. And I saw those two drive off. 
20 The charcoal gray car pulled up beside it. 
21 I said, oh, I forgot my cigarette butt, I left it on 
22 the kitchen counter. So I walked in, I got it, I 
23 came back out, I left and I walked to the other side 
24 of the porch, just look around, I like to look 
25 around, see the cars and see who is out and

7 wasn't no slow flame, it just whoosh. 
8 You talking about the memorial? 
9 Yes. 
10 Did you see anybody go other 
11 and do anything? 
12 I didn't see anybody. They 
13 could have done anything from the car window. They 
14 could have threw something out of the window. But 
15 that was definitely to me an accelerant because the

8 questions for you, okay. 
9 My understanding is before we took the 
10 break, you talk about one concern you had, 
11 obviously, after this shooting occurred, people 
12 coming out and saying things that were not true 
13 based on what you saw, correct? 
14 Yes. 
15 One of those things these 
16 young men coming out saying that Michael Brown had 
17 his hands all the way up in the air like 
18 surrendering at the time that the shooting was going 
19 on; is that correct? 
20 Right. 
21 You didn't see that? 
22 I did not see that. 
23 Okay. I just want to 
24 clarify that. If I could, I referred you to some of 
25 your statement on August 12th and I just want to

2 now, okay. And if you like, I have another copy 
3 here, you can refer to if you want to or I can read 
4 you these portions, is that fine? 
5 That's fine. 
6 Okay. At the bottom of page 
7 seven it said, you are referring to Michael Brown, 
8 you said that he had like one foot on the grass and 
9 one foot on the driveway, which you told us today. 
10 And then he turned around and he was like this. So 
11 that is why people thought he raised his hands, and 
12 I think you are talking there about people claiming 
13 that he had his hands raised. You said he did 
14 something like this, is that what you are referring 
15 to him looking at his body? 
16 Looking at his body. And I 
17 stated there they embellish, they embellish. 
18 Okay. 
19 He had them up, to make it 
20 clearer that he was giving up, they went from one, 
21 which is what I saw to something that they probably, 
22 they assumed he did and stuck them straight up in 
23 the air.

1 And so when you were 
2 demonstrating that he turned around and he had his 
3 hands like this, that is why people thought he 
4 raised his hands, you're talking about when he was 
5 looking at himself to try to determine whether he 
6 was injured? 
7 Right. 
8 Okay. And you said you went 
9 on page eight, you said he looked down and then he 
10 did this, and he looked at the officer and he walked 
11 and he took about three to five steps. He hit him 
12 again, pow, pow, pow. So you were demonstrating 
13 there again and then as you went on, Detective 
14 made an effort to kind of narrate the way you 
15 were demonstrating on the tape, do you recall that? 
16 Back on August 12th, when you were demonstrating for 
17 him he was kind of narrating back to you so it would 
18 show up on the tape, do you recall that? 
19 I believe so. 
20 Okay. On page 17 of your 
21 statement you said as he faces the officer, strike

3 like this. And Detective says, kind of

5 And, of course, you can't see that on the 
6 tape so the detective narrates and he says, your 
7 arms are like palms up, and hands and fingers are 
8 roughly shoulder height, is that fair enough to say? 
9 You say, yeah, about close to his 
10 shoulder, yes, uh-huh. 
11 Not in the position that you 
12 got. 
13 Okay. 
14 When I said it, I said like

7 Okay. You say that they are 
8 about close to his shoulder and Detective 
9 says they are at about somewhat of an angle. And 
10 you say, what would you say, a 35 or 45 degree angle 
11 from the body. 
12 And you go on to say on page 18, he's 
13 standing there and he's looking, he's looking down 
14 at his body. And he looks up at the officer and you 
15 say, he looks up at the officer and by this time he 
16 was standing facing him after he turned around in 
17 this position. 
18 On page 19 you say, Detective asked 
19 you, Michael Brown is standing facing the officer at 
20 this point with his hands at his rib cage. So now

3 The first volley of shots? 
4 After the first volley of 
5 shots, his arms came down because he was staggering. 
6 Like he was coming, as he got hit like, oh, shoot, 
7 he was staggering around, all right. 
8 They had to come down a little bit, they 
9 were coming down. Like I said, when they weren't at 
10 his body, I didn't say they were next to his body. 
11 He asked me a question, I demonstrated and he said 
12 something that his narration is not what I showed, 
13 okay. 
14 The narration is not? 
15 Whatever he wrote, I don't 
16 know, he just stated, yes, but his depiction of what 
17 I said of what I showed him is incorrect.

1 up, and so they're at his rib cage, palms up. 
2 And then you say well, they weren't up 
3 against his rib cage, it was out because he was 
4 looking down, slightly away from his body. 
5 Uh-huh. 
6 And Detective says 
7 that he was looking down at his body at some point. 
8 And you say, right, right, uh-huh. 
9 And then you go on to say on page 20. 
10 Detective says, is anybody saying anything at 
11 this point? 
12 And you say the officer as he raised his 
13 head, he told him to stop. As Michael Brown raised 
14 his head, the officer told hold to stop; is that 
15 right? 
16 Right. 
17 And he says, as Michael 
18 Brown raises his head? And you said, as he raises 
19 his head, he says stop right there. He asked you, 
20 the officer says this? And your response was, yeah, 
21 he did say stop. And when he left from that fixed 
22 spot, then he was walking toward him. 
23 And he asked you, towards the officer?

3 you think he took before the officer fired? He 
4 said, big boy, he didn't take that many steps, I 
5 really couldn't count, yeah. 
6 And so that's the first volley that he has

11 sure of that. That's why I wanted to ask you about 
12 this, sir. You know, there were three or four times 
13 where Detective , or you went back to when 
14 Michael Brown turned around and where his hands 
15 were. And on August 12th, I mean, there wasn't even 
16 any mention with him having his hands up with his 
17 palms facing the officer or all the way up. 
18 I didn't say, when he turned, 
19 his hands was up, he was looking down to see where 
20 he was hit. 
21 Uh-huh.

24 he faced the officer, there they were.

3 On the 12th you only 
4 describe him as having his palms up toward the sky,

6 No, I did not say that they

14 face the officer, his hands were in this position.

16 out, sir, or were the palms facing up?

3 facing the officer they weren't like this pointed 
4 towards the sky. They were pointed toward him. 
5 That's what I wanted to ask 
6 you is because on August 12th, I mean, you never 
7 said anything at any time about his palms actually 
8 facing the officer. 
9 I said his hands were up. I 
10 never said his palms were facing the sky. I said

12 away from the body, that's what I said. I'm going 
13 to stick with that because that's what I saw. 
14 Before the first volley 
15 though, his hands were coming down towards his rib 
16 cage? 
17 Yeah, he was looking for 
18 them, he's still looking like. He's searching to 
19 see where he was shot. His arms were like this. 
20 All right. Now you have

1 When he turned around and 
2 faced the officer, I'm going to say it again, this 
3 is what I saw. His hands was up shoulder length, 
4 palms facing the officer, not up toward the sky. 
5 That is my definition of palm, hands up, okay. 
6 Now, when the people down the street 
7 demonstrate they say hands up, they are like this.

11 looking at his body like this. And just as he 
12 started turning, the officer said stop and he was 
13 still looking.

15 caught looking at the officer, his arm proceeded to 
16 go out like this. Palms away from, facing the

8 All right. But if I 
9 understand correctly, what you said today and what 
10 you said on August 12th is, he then takes a step or 
11 two forward off that curb. 
12 Uh-huh. 
13 The officer was saying stop 
14 again. 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 And at the time of that 
17 first volley, his hands had come back down towards 
18 his rib cage where again he is looking to see if he 
19 had been shot. 
20 I have to say he already had 
21 them down. As he turned, he started to face the 
22 officer, his hands were up. They didn't come back 
23 down again until after the volley was fired. 
24 The first volley? 
25 The first volley.

16 I go like this. A round of 
17 shots go off, his hands are still here. 
18 His hands are here and then 
19 he steps forward, stop. 
20 As he's turning around, you 
21 said going like this, does he take a step forward?

17 times. 
18 How many steps do you think he took before

13 walked in the door and she was freaking out. She is 
14 running all through the house. And when we looked 
15 back, we never saw the sight of the other officer. 
16 We saw the other police officer walked up to the 
17 sidewalk. He stopped right there. And then 
18 everyone from this side, from this building, this 
19 building, started running up to the front. And then 
20 there was a crowd that came from this way. 
21 It is almost like someone had, 
22 whatever kids are doing and the crowd is whoosh, 
23 came right there, that was it.

Tremendous amount. 
And did you see that they were doing crime

1 they put tapes up, can't even see there's a pole and 
2 another tree right here. They ran it from here to a 
3 pole here, across the street and then there's 
4 another tree here. They had almost like boxed it in 
5 right there. 
6 While they were doing it, that's when 
7 the stepfather, I later found out was the stepfather 
8 and his cousin were coming down the street. She was 
9 screaming and hollering, and my focus was on the 
10 stepfather because I was trying, they was trying to 
11 keep him from crossing the tape. He wanted to go 
12 over and see his body. 
13 When he got there, I left out of my 
14 apartment, went around the street, got right up here 
15 where his head was pointing towards this direction 
16 to see who he was. I had an idea, but I wasn't 
17 sure. When I got there, I saw his face, that's when 
18 I noticed who he was. When I saw that, I'm like oh, 
19 my God. So I went immediately back. I just wanted 
20 to go down there to see. 
21 I'm still worried about and 
22 my sister-in-law because they was still freaking 
23 out. When I got back, the lady that is downstairs 
24 with me and I told her. You know that big guy that

Yes, it is right there. 
But it is generally, you're right, it is

8 right down the street. 
9 Q So I'm going to show you Image Number 25,

11 pointed towards the guy, his body. This is the

1 A No, it bends around. See how it bends 
2 around? The truck is pointing this way, I'm still 
3 looking down toward it, I'm still, I'm looking at 
4 the passenger side. 
5 Q Okay. Now, from the point that you saw 
6 Michael Brown stop and he turned around, to the 
7 point where he eventually fell into the street, can 
8 you give me an idea, your best estimate of how far 
9 that was?

12 35 feet.

1 recall when he turned around, did he turn around so 
2 that he faced your direction or did he turn the 
3 other way clockwise or counterclockwise or do you 
4 know? 
5 A He turned over left. So that would be 
6 what, counterclockwise, yeah. 
7 Q So if you are the officer and I'm Mike 
8 Brown. 
9 A Spin to your left, turn around to your 
10 left, like that.

A

Yes.

Now, you said in a previous statement that 
17 when he was looking down, it looked like he might 
18 have been looking at his hands. 
19 A Hands or side or whatever, he was trying 
20 to look, I said looking at his body to try to see 
21 where he was shot. 
22 Q And you said previously that you could see 
23 something on his hand?

25 the distance, we weren't quite sure. In fact, we

1 kind of discussed that. I have told the officer it 
2 looks like he had something on his hand, but I can't 
3 give you 100 percent, I can't say for 100 percent 
4 that it was something.

7 really tell.

9 
10 
Q 
A 
Q 
Sure. 
You know, that's what I thought. 
As he turned around and he's turning 
11 around away from you to face the officer, then if 
12 he's on this corner and you are right here, you're 
13 seeing him primarily from behind? 
14 A Right, his back was turned. When he got 
15 to the edge of the driveway where your finger is, 
16 his back was turned to us and his back was facing 
17 our side of the street. He had stopped. This is 
18 the street, he stopped and he did like this. And he 
19 was turning around like this, you know, on the left 
20 side as you turn, that's the way he was turning. 
21 Q He turned to face the officer, was the 
22 officer in the street actually? 
23 A Yes, he was at the rear of his vehicle at 
24 that time. He had to pull his gun out and he had it 
25 in his hand, you know, the defensive spot I guess,

1 or whatever they said it is. 
2 Q Michael Brown would have been looking back 
3 in this direction? 
4 A He was looking, okay. The officer was 
5 standing on this side out in the middle of the 
6 street right here. He was looking this direction, 
7 not that way. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
This is the sidewalk right here. 
Well, he is looking out this way because 
10 the officer's truck is still in the street. He's at 
11 the rear of the truck, he's at the rear of his 
12 vehicle.

14 middle of the road, correct?

Right. 
So the officer is in the middle of the

4 that point, correct?

And the officer is telling him to stop, 
10 but he moves towards the officer?

18

Q 
All right. 
From his feet to that corner is 48 feet 
19 and 2 inches, does that sound about right?

21 say that's the measurement, that's what it is. I 
22 don't know the distance.

1 travel, he moved from this corner toward the officer 
2 until he was down dead in the street? 
3 A Right. 
4 Q And if that was measured, I don't want you 
5 to comment on somebody else's accuracy, if someone 
6 measured it and said it was 48 feet and 2 inches? 
7 A I would have to agree. 
Q Does that sound about right? 8 
9 A I would have to agree, but I'm saying from 
10 my vantage point from what I thought or assumed, it 
11 looks like it was about 35 feet. If it measured 
12 that much, then it is. 
13 Q Okay. And as you say he turns around, he 
14 puts his hand up and he starts to move toward the 
15 officer, you hear the officer tell him to stop? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q And you said he gets two or three steps 
18 and the officer shoots pow, pow, pow, three or four 
19 times? 
20 A Yeah. 
21 Q And at that point you kind of acted, not 
22 acted, I didn't mean to say acted, but you 
23 demonstrated that he kind of appeared to have been 
24 hit?

13 toward the officer, I mean, if the measurement is 
14 correct, at some point he travels 42, or 48 feet and 
15 2 inches from the corner to where his feet were. 
16 But he only moves twice, according to what your 
17 recollection is, correct? 
18 A First time when he told him to stop, he 
19 moved and stepped out into the street. Then he 
20 started to stagger forward, the officer took some 
21 steps back. He told him to stop, he yelled stop 
22 three times again and after he yelled the third stop 
23 he fired again.

25 shots, not in the car, but after Michael Brown

Q Or thereabouts?

10 after he fired off that first volley.

Q 
A

He started coming, he was trying to keep 
13 himself up. He looked like he was hit, so his hands

18 come down, could it be that his hand went somewhere 
19 
20 
around his torso? (indicating) 
A No, his hands kind of came, they were 
21 still out to the side, he was still like this. He 
22 was trying to balance hisself, his hands came down 
23 about chest or waist. He had his head up looking at 
24 him and he was staggering, trying to stay on his 
25 feet.

3 oh, my God, he's getting ready to kill him. And

7 Q Okay. I'm not going to be so, I'm not 
8 going to belabor this too terribly much. Do you 
9 recall in your statement with the County Police, you

And there was another detective, 
correct? 
Uh-huh. 
And they spent almost an hour or about an 
5 hour talking to you that day. And at some point, 
6 I'm going to refer you to page number 21. And you 
7 talk about where his hands were after the first 
8 volley of shots. And then you say after he hit him 
9 with the three shots, they came down? 
10 A Here, and I stood up and I showed him. 
11 Like I said, his hands were about right here and 
12 they look like he, looks like his hands, like I said 
13 in the statement were limp, they were going down. 
14 Q Detective says, okay, where at? 
15 And you say, down besides his body like this. So 
16 obviously you are demonstrating. 
17 A Yes, coming down. By the time, when I 
18 showed him, he asked me where they were, I stood up 
19 and showed him that his hands were coming down. 
20 They were down almost by his side, they were coming 
21 down. 
22 Q And then he says, okay, and you are 
23 basically putting your hands down at your side and 
24 you say, yeah, they were like they went limp. 
25 A Yeah, they were like this.

1 looking at hisself to see what is going on. And he 
2 started to turn with his back to me like this, he 
3 had his hands up like this, and he looked at the 
4 officer. The officer was at the back of his truck, 
5 he yells stop. 
6 So Michael took a step from the 
7 blacktop to the street, he was walking towards him. 
8 He was walking towards him, but he had his hands up 
9 like this. (indicating) 
10 When he stepped out into the street, 
11 the officer fired three times. When he hit him, he 
12 started to stagger around and his hands started, 
13 like this coming down, so his hands were going limp 
14 and he was staggering toward the officer. 
15 As he was moving towards the officer, 
16 the officer was moving back, and the officer told 
17 him stop, stop, stop. By the time he said the third 
18 stop, Michael was still trying to stay up on his 
19 feet. That's when the comments were made behind me, 
20 no, he's not going to shoot him again, the man can't 
21 even stand on his feet. The next thing I know, he 
22 fired the other shots. 
23 He couldn't hardly stand up, so when 
24 he fired, he was going down. When I went down and I 
25 looked and I'm saying okay, that's the only way he

1 could have hit him in the head. He had to be going 
2 down. 
3 Everyone come back from the back 
4 said, oh, no, he went down to his knees. He did not 
5 go down to his knees. And then they said, the 
6 officer walked up to him and shot him in the back of 
7 his head. No, that's not what happened, okay. The 
8 officer didn't walk over there and say okay, bam, 
9 no, he didn't do that. 
10 Michael did not go down on his knees 
11 and stand there like that in front of the officer 
12 like that. When he shot the last rounds, he went 
13 down and he landed face first. Okay. When he hit 
14 that ground, that's when my attention went from him 
15 to her.

17 
Q 
A 
Right. 
All right. That's when everyone started 
18 running up here making accusations and assumptions 
19 they saw this young man lying down in the street. 
20 They saw this police car, they saw the other car 
21 over here, this other officer on the north side of 
22 the street, on the sidewalk, then it went from zero 
23 to 100 in a split second. Because the crowd got 
24 there and then you had everyone that's on this side 
25 here in the immediate building right across from him

It went from whew, it was terrible. 
And from the time that Michael Brown 
4 stopped on that corner until he fell in the street, 
5 are we talking about a matter of just a few seconds? 
6 A A few seconds. Again, that incident as 
7 I've described from the people coming up, that 
8 incident after that first shot, initial shot at the 
9 truck when they ran it went from zero to 100 in a 
10 split second also. It was slow motion to us, but it 
11 was moving. 
12 Q And just backing up briefly and talking 
13 about what happened up at the truck. You said that 
14 because the truck was pointed toward Northwinds and 
15 they're on the driver's side, the car is between you 
16 and them, correct? 
17 A Right. 
18 Q And so you can't really see what's going 
19 on inside the truck, would that be fair to say? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
No, we couldn't. 
You said, at some point in the previous 
22 statement you said, when the officer fired or when 
23 he heard the gunshot, it seemed like he was trying 
24 to get him off of him? 
25 A I don't know what was happening in that

Page 142 
Okay. 
I could not tell you. I could not see. 
4 All we could see was there was some type of 
5 disturbance or altercation at the side of that 
6 truck, okay. We could not see if the officer got 
7 out of the truck and/or Michael they say he got out 
8 and Michael pushed him back in. We can't see that 
9 because we are on the opposite side. 
10 All I know is that when we heard that 
11 shot and his friend went that way and Michael went 
12 there, the officer exited his vehicle, came around 
13 to the back and assumed the position. That's what 
14 we saw.

16 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And then after that, whew, they scattered.

18 Q But do you remember on August 12th, again, 
19 I'll show you here on a transcript when the officer 
20 was asking you, and he's talking about what was 
21 happening, what was going on at the car.

4 
A 
Q 
Right, that's my impression on the 12th. 
Okay. Has that changed, do you still feel 
5 that the officer, in your opinion, it looked look he 
6 was trying to get him off of him? 
7 A Whatever was going on in that truck, if 
8 Michael had a grip on him or he had a grip on 
9 Michael, some way he just felt the only way he can 
10 get him out or so that he can get control of the 
11 situation was to fire. He fired. 
12 When he came out and he stepped out 
13 into that street and he fired the first volley, we 
14 figure okay, that's it. We were also yelling at 
15 him, and my sister-in-law yelling, stop 
16 man, stop, stop, stop. 
17 As he was staggering forward, that's 
18 when he said oh, my God, he's getting ready to kill 
19 him because he backed up, the officer backed up and 
20 then he shot him again. 
21 To this day no one is going to change 
22 my mind, if he had not fired that last volley, that 
23 young man would have been alive. Because even 
24 though he was coming toward him, he had no weapon. 
25 His hands were coming down. They were not in front

1 of him they, were to his side. 
2 Q Okay. 
3 A He was staggering, trying to stay on his 
4 feet. The only way he could have got shot in the 
5 top of his head when he was firing that last round, 
6 he was on his way down, he hit him in the top of his 
7 head. Eye, top, only way. 
8 Q So in a matter of seconds, you can clearly 
9 see that Michael Brown was going down? 
10 A Right. 
11 Q When the second volley went out? 
12 A Right. 
13 Q When the second volley went out. 
14 A That second volley went off, he was 
15 coming, you can almost tell his body was going limp 
16 because he was like this, he was like this. He was 
17 looking up at him, like I'm looking at you and I'm 
18 still trying to stay on my feet. Only way he could 
19 do was go down, he's top heavy. The man was 
20 290 pounds. (indicating) 
21 Q But from this point to where he moved 
22 toward the officer, you would agree if the 
23 measurement said 48 feet, that that's about right? 
24 
25 
A I said 30, 35, if it says 48, it was 48.

11 police car, Michael ran? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Right. 
Did the officer trot or run after him? 
No, he exited his vehicle, Michael was 
15 going in this direction to here. He had to come 
16 around so he can get an eye on him. If he went 
17 around to this side, I don't think he could have 
18 seen him. I mean, if he hadn't of stopped, I don't 
19 think he would of had a good line of sight on him. 
20 I think in his mind, the only way he 
21 thought maybe he thought he was going to run back 
22 the way he came, I don't know. 
23 
24 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
What was going through the officer's mind,

1 to do. All I know is he came out of the car and he 
2 came around to the back. He was standing at the 
3 rear. 
4 Q Okay. Did he shoot at Michael Brown while 
5 Michael Brown was running? 
6 A We didn't hear no shots until after he got 
7 there and he moved off. When Michael got there, he 
8 had already stopped. He stood right there and the 
9 officer told him stop.

1 Q 
Page 147 
At the time that his back was to the 
2 officer, did it appear to you that he had been shot? 
3 A I assume that he was because his hands was 
4 up, he was standing with his back to us, but he was 
5 looking at his body. As he was turning, he was 
6 still looking down. And, you know, when he yelled 
7 stop, his head came up and was looking at the 
8 
9 
officer, and he did like this. (indicating)

24 had his hands up, was it in your opinion was he 
25 surrendering at that point?

1 A When he left from here and he was walking 
2 toward him, I believe he was giving up. 
3 Q Why? 
4 A Because his hands was up, he was walking 
5 toward him. Where was he going to go. The officer 
6 was standing there with a gun dead aimed on him. 
7 Q And you never saw a weapon with, you never 
8 saw Michael Brown with a weapon? 
A No, no. 9 
10 Q Did you ever see Michael Brown appear to 
11 be reaching for a weapon? 
12 A No, no, his arms never went down to reach 
13 for his belt, his hands stayed in this position 
14 until he stepped off, off of this right here into 
15 the street. And then when he got shot, that's when 
16 his arms started moving. He was like oh, my God, 
17 that's it, okay. 
18 At that time when he fired off that 
19 first volley right there, it still didn't look like 
20 he was trying to reach for any weapon, he was trying 
21 to see what was going on, where he was hit, all 
22 right. 
23 As he was coming off of there and 
24 fired that next volley, his hands were coming down 
25 beside his body. It was like he got hit, that's it.

1 He started staggering, he was staggering as he was 
2 doing it. As he came, his body, his torso, his legs 
3 were straight up, but his torso was almost like at a 
4 45 degree angle with his head came up to look at the 
5 officer. 
6 The officer moved back three steps as 
7 Michael was walking toward him or staggering toward 
8 him, he took about three steps back and he was still 
9 yelling. I clearly heard him tell Mike, stop, stop, 
10 stop. But you can say that the man was in distress, 
11 he was trying to stay on his feet. As he said that, 
12 after he said the last stop, he fired.

18 you know he was shot in the head? 
19 A We went around there, the amount of blood, 
20 excuse me, after they covered him up, they put a 
21 white sheet over his body, white sheet covered his 
22 head. When I went back up there, the sheet had, 
23 this is his head, the sheet extended about this far 
24 out, about 2, 3 three feet this way, about 3 feet 
25 this way. It was completely soaked. Can only come

6 anything that would jeopardize 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A That is my main concern. That's why I'm 
9 out there. 
10 Q And those last shots, in your opinion, the 
11 officer did not have to fire because Michael was 
12 already disabled? 
13 A He was already disabled, yes, in my 
14 opinion he was already disabled because you could 
15 clearly see the man was in distress and was trying 
16 to stay on his feet.

1 you guys were just talking about. So your opinion 
2 right before the last volley of shots, he had lost 
3 control of his body when the yelling stop, stop, 
4 stop, your opinion is that he couldn't stop because 
5 he had lost --
6 A No, he couldn't stop because he was 
7 wobbly, you could see he was trying to stand up. 
8 You could see clearly, we could see he was trying to 
9 stand up. That's when and them were 
10 yelling at him, man, stop, please stop, please stop, 
11 he was trying to stand up. Because the way of the 
12 angle of his body, he was like bent over with his 
13 head up. And you could see almost instantaneously, 
14 you can see him going down. You know, that's why 
15 everyone sitting up there talking about he went down 
16 to his knees he went face first. 
17 I'm going to say it again, 
18 your opinion then is that you felt like he could not 
19 stop? 
20 A No. 
21 He could not control his 
22 body? 
23 A No, he could not control his body, he had 
24 been hit. I don't know how many people in here or 
25 if anyone has, but I know I have. I've been shot.

1 And when that bullet hits you, you don't immediately 
2 feel it. First thing you feel is the heat and when 
3 that heat hits you, everything goes haywire. 
4 He could not stand it okay. 
5 I have 
6 a question. When you and Kathi were talking, she 
7 indicated it was 48 feet and 2 inches from where he 
8 was first shot at the corner to where he was last 
9 shot. When he was last shot and fell to the ground 
10 we determined that it was about 20 feet, you said 20 
11 to 25 feet, we determined 15 to 20, we are going to 
12 split the difference 20 feet, okay. Heated 
13 situation, everybody is crazy. 
14 A Uh-huh. 
15 The officer doesn't know 
16 whether or not he has a weapon and Michael Brown is 
17 still moving forward. 
18 A Yes, he is he is staggering forward. 
19 If it took just a few 
20 seconds for him to travel 48 feet and 2 inches, it 
21 wouldn't take very long for him to travel 20 feet, 
22 right? 
23 A Right. 
24 What do you think the 
25 officer should have done?

4 officer did not know any of these things. 
5 A I don't know their procedures. Okay. 
6 They're saying he's coming, he's probably menacing, 
7 I've heard all kind of things. 
8 You can't really see his 
9 face though, right? 
10 A I cannot see his face, but I can clearly 
11 see his hands were coming down. 
12 You can see like this?

he went down now.

had moved a certain distance before he

1 your statement on the 12th, you said I'm going to 
2 call it or I'm going to say it, I feel like he was 
3 executed. From what you are describing to us, you 
4 know, the police officer saying stop, stop, stop, 
5 and him continuing to move and even moving after 
6 he's injured, urn, do you still feel that way? 
7 A Yes, because I don't believe he had any 
8 weapons on him. 
9 You don't believe --
10 A They didn't find any weapons on him. He 
11 was hit, he was in distress, he was coming at him 
12 and he wasn't coming toward the officer to do any 
13 harm, he was trying to stand on his feet. 
14 And the only direction his body could 
15 move was forward, all right. He knew he hit him, he 
16 know how many shots, but as big as Michael was, I 
17 don't know what's going through his mind. I can't 
18 read his mind, the officer's mind. Maybe he thought 
19 that Michael was coming at him as big as he is, he 
20 could still do some harm to him. 
21 Maybe he did. 
22 A That's why he felt like he had to use 
23 deadly force. I'm seeing someone who is hit, who is 
24 clearly in distress, who cannot stand on his feet, 
25 why?

1 Again, I'm going to go 
2 back to what you just said. I just have to know, 
3 this is very important. You said you don't know 
4 what's going through the officer's mind, maybe he 
5 did think he was in distress, you just said that, 
6 right? 
7 A Yeah. 
8 He didn't know whether or 
9 not 
10 A He could see that he was in distress. 
11 But he didn't know 
12 whether he was in danger? 
13 A He didn't know whether he was coming. He 
14 may have assumed that hey, I got this 6'5", 290 
15 pound guy and I already put four bullets in him and 
16 he is still coming. 
17 And he's still moving 
18 toward him? 
19 A And he's still moving. But he should have 
20 clear sight to see that this man was in distress. 
21 He could see that he could not, barely stand on his 
22 feet. But to take to fire four more rounds was 
23 excessive in my opinion, okay.

1 said when the officer exited the vehicle after the 
2 first shot is fired what, in your mind, how, can you 
3 picture how many seconds it took, he came out, you 
4 say, did he come out already, drawn his weapon? 
5 A I can't see him from the driver's side. 
6 As he was coming around, you could see the gun in 
7 his hand. By the time he got to the back bumper of 
8 his truck, it was in this position. He had already 
9 unholstered, he had to cause by the time he got to 
10 the back of the truck, it was coming up and he got 
11 in that stance quick. (indicating) 
12 If anything would have 
13 been in his vision in order to not see Mr. Brown, 
14 because you said --
15 A Well, he had to turn his back to him for a 
16 split second because he's coming around from the 
17 back of the truck, he's running this way, Michael is 
18 going that way, but he came around to the back of 
19 the truck. 
20 Right. 
21 A To get a line of sight on him. So he had 
22 for a split second to come around, but as he's 
23 coming round, he could see through his windows. He 
24 could look through the windows of the truck to see 
25 where he is, okay. But when he came around to the

11 The officer, even though 
12 he came around his vehicle, did he ever come at an 
13 angle closer because I think I believe I read in 
14 your testimony on August the 12th that you said that 
15 he had set at angle, like catty-corner 
16 A When I said at an angle, I was giving the 
17 position that the officer was standing in. He 
18 wasn't like this, he stood like this. (indicating)

The guy that was with him? 
A Oh, I didn't know his name. I never knew 
3 his name. No, huh-uh. Once Michael hit that side, 
4 we looked back, I didn't know where he went. We 
5 assumed, excuse me, that this is the building, we 
6 thought he had ran around to the side of the 
7 building over here, but in his statements on the 
8 news he was behind one of the police trucks. We 
9 didn't see that. 
10 I mean, he is a little guy, truck is 
11 kind of high, all right. My eyesight was on 
12 Michael, for some odd reason we are glued to him, 
13 okay. Because as the officer was coming around, we 
14 figure that something happened between Mike, we knew 
15 Michael was at the truck, we was watching them two. 
16 Him, we didn't see him, he 
17 disappeared. He was a little guy, he was gone. 
18 Okay, but by the time the officer had gotten around 
19 here, there was another truck came down and he got 
20 in that spot. There was another police officer

5 Did you ever see any other

During the shooting?

10 cars from everywhere was coming, you know. But 
11 before they, as they were coming, it was the crowd 
12 of people were coming from everywhere. From up here 
13 at Ellison, this is the first street. From there, 
14 from all parts of the complex and from Northwinds 
15 they are running up there.

17 they stayed in Northwinds, he was one of the first 
18 ones there. And they started, everyone got on their

And he turned around. And

9 Can you clarify at what 
10 point you actually saw that? 
11 A As he turned, and he you could see as he 
12 is coming around, he's spinning around, looked like 
13 we saw something that was on his hand cause he kept 
14 doing like this. He kept looking at hit and then he 
15 looked down, he looked at both sides of his body. 
16 So I'm guessing he may have touched 
17 hisself to see if there was blood or something cause 
18 you could see there was splotches cause he's real 
19 dark and then he turned around and he did that, 
20 looked up. And as he spun around, and then he says 
21 that's it, boom. When he turned around, he had his

6 court reporter, and we have just gotten back from 
7 our lunch break. 
8 I do have two officers who I believe are 
9 going to testify this afternoon. One is going to be 
10 Detective He's the officer who is 
11 the primary case officer investigating this matter. 
12 I'm only going, we're not going to get into the 
13 entire investigation. I'm simply calling him to ask 
14 him some questions about the interview that he had 
15 with 
16 And then after that, we will have 
17 If you recall he was the crime scene 
18 investigator who went to the Ferguson Police 
19 Department, and then followed them to the hospital 
20 and actually took pictures of Officer Wilson and 
21 then he will testify about seizing other items 
22 because we had to interrupt him to get Dr. 
23 on, if you recall. Hopefully he will just be like 
24 another 30 minutes. 
25 Neither of them are here yet, I assume

8 Q If Michael Brown had turned around at this 
9 corner and walked in a direction down the street 
10 toward the officer coming from near the grassy 
11 corner toward the middle of the street, would 
12 have a straight-on view of Mr. Brown at 
13 that point? In other words, could he see his front? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. Would he see directly his back or 
16 would he see an angle part of that? 
17 A I would say that he would be able to see a 
18 slight angle, but see his back, yes. 
19

Q 
A 
Q 
Mostly his back?

1 whether his hands were all the way up or not and 
2 is saying he didn't have them all the way up, 
3 but he did have them all the way up, I'm not sure if 
4 that's a typo or not. Are you with me? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
I'm with you. 
Enough to notice this officer should know 
7 he was not threatening him, he was not in imminent 
8 danger, the boy was not threating him in any way, 
9 he's not charging, he was struggling to stay on his 
10 feet. 
11 So he didn't tell you, he never told 
12 you he was surrendering that is as you said, 
13 correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But he characterized Michael Brown as not 
16 threatening the officer in his opinion? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And then he was, his hands, he 
19 didn't say he had them all the way up, he did have 
20 them all the way up enough for this officer to know 
21 that he was not threatening him, did he demonstrate 
22 what he meant by that? 
23 A I don't believe he did. I took it that he 
24 was still making reference to the same posture that 
25 I have previously describe.

Say that again? 
I took it that he was making reference to 
3 the same posture that he had previously described to 
4 us. 
5 Q As not threatening, his hands were up, but 
6 he was not being threatening? 
7 A Correct, the hands that I described 
8 earlier, hands up, about shoulder height. 
9 Q Okay. And that was the not threatening

MS. WHIRLEY: That's all I have. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Detective if you 
15 can refer to page seven. And near the bottom of the 
16 page where you get to the point where 
17 is telling you about how Michael Brown had ran and 
18 then he turned and then in the last paragraph on 
19 that page, , referring to Michael Brown 
20 says, right at the, he had like one foot on the 
21 grass and one foot on the driveway, and then he 
22 turned around and then he like, like this. 
23 (indicating) So that is why people thought he raised 
24 his hands. 
25 Is he gesturing or demonstrating when

1 he says he turned around and he like, like this, was 
2 he demonstrating? 
3 A Again, making reference to what I had 
4 previously stood up and described. 
5 Q Okay. So when he said, he like, like 
6 this, that is why people thought he raised his 
7 hands, was he making that same motion that you have 
8 already demonstrated? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else have questions? 
12 I guess 
13 the whole hands up is he -- when you -- I guess, 
14 what would be your definition of hands up, all the 
15 way up or would they be like this or like that? 
16 A Well, I mean, obviously the two motions 
17 that you made your hands were both up. 
18 Okay. I'm actually 
19 reading from, I guess, this is page 18. And you say 
20 your arms are like palms up and hands and fingers 
21 are roughly shoulder length, is that fair enough to 
22 say? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: It is close to the top of 
24 the page. 
25 A So if you would, if you would make

1 reference to page 17 on that, at the bottom of the 
2 page. We're discussing, this is kind of when we get 
3 into the specifics of it, but he says as he faces 
4 the officer, I asked him, his hands go up to a point 
5 where? And he says about to his shoulders. 
6 So he's making reference, again, and 
7 this is kind of what I'm explaining. He is making 
8 reference to his hands or his fingers being roughly 
9 shoulder height, which is as how he was describing 
10 as I am explaining it here. And then we make 
11 reference to his elbows, and kind of like I 
12 described to everyone earlier, that his elbows were 
13 again, close to his body. I'm not saying touching 
14 his body, but close to his body in a position like 
15 this. (indicating) 
16 And then it goes on, we again clarify 
17 palms are up, hands or fingers are roughly shoulder 
18 height, is that fair enough to say? And he says, 
19 yeah, about close to his shoulders, yes. 
20 So then again, I'm just clarifying 
21 with him that we are kind of, we are talking about 
22 almost a plane here that would extend from his 
23 shoulders to where his fingers or his hands would 
24 be. Did I answer your question? 
25 Okay.

1 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
2 And then 
3 to clarify that, would that be sustained for you to 
4 say that he had his hands up? 
5 A That he, that was saying 
6 that Michael Brown had his hands up. 
7 Yes. 
8 A Yes, ma'am, that he had his hands in the 
9 position I described, yes. 
10 If you said halt, would 
11 you consider that that person had his hands up? 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, let me say for the 
13 record just so we can make clear on the record you 
14 have your palms facing forward when you are doing 
15 that, correct? 
16 Maybe I don't know what 
17 hands up is. If someone raised their arms, I would 
18 think hands up. I would think regardless if my 
19 hands are faced this way, my arms are up, to me 
20 that's a stop, you see what I'm saying? To me 
21 that's what I'm trying to get clarification. 
22 A Okay. Could you ask the question one more 
23 time, please? 
24 My question is, the way 
25 that said the way he saw Mr. Brown raise

1 his hands. 
2 A Yes, ma'am. 
3 Would that be substantial 
4 for you as a police officer to say that you said 
5 stop, stop or halt, halt, and a person raised their 
6 hands, would that be okay for you to say oh, he had 
7 his hands up, a surrender motion? 
8 A I would say it would depend on the 
9 situation that I was in. 
10 I mean, so this would be 
11 stop. Is it fair to say that he might have been 
12 hurt somewhere where he couldn't raise his hands all 
13 the way up? 
14 A Well, I think based off of s 
15 statement, he was indicating that Michael Brown was, 
16 as I kind of described earlier, that he was checking 
17 himself to see if he was injured. 
18 So, yes, when you and I are sitting 
19 here having this conversation, are my hands up right 
20 now, and I'm am demonstrating what I had previously 
21 demonstrated the position that had 
22 described to me. So if I'm sitting here like this, 
23 are my hands up? Yes, my hands are up.

1 a surrender situation? Could they be separated? 
2 Your hands up in the method you described, that 
3 doesn't necessarily 100 percent mean that it would 
4 be a surrender, it could be a case by case basis?

1 make sure I understand. Everything that he said 
2 from what I can see he is talking about having his 
3 hands, palms up, rib cage length, maybe out a little 
4 bit and looking at himself searching for injuries? 
5 A Correct. 
6 There is never anything 
7 in here where he puts his arms up to his shoulders 
8 with his palms out? 
9 A With his palms out, no, but again, 
10 remember as I described, he does his hands. I'm not 
11 saying to his shoulders, like palms forward facing, 
12 but he does have his hands at shoulder, yes, ma'am 
13 at shoulder height. 
14 Okay. 
15 
16 
A But with palms up. 
I'm looking at 
17 the line of sight that would have as he 
18 is looking at Michael Brown. I don't see how he 
19 could see the right side of his right hand from the 
20 angle he is at. Seems like he could only probably 
21 see the left arm and left hand, would you say that's 
22 a fair assessment? I know he is looking down 
23 somewhat, maybe he can see something over the 
24 shoulder.

14 Because what I was 
15 wondering is there a standard norm, would this be a

4 Q Detective , I will remind you that 
5 you were sworn previously on September 9th and that 
6 oath is still I in effect, all right? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q Just to get back where we had left off. 
9 If you recall he has already given testimony about 
10 having photographed Darren Wilson's face and neck 
11 areas and that he then also talked about having gone 
12 back to the Ferguson Police Department and seizing 
13 the gun, and you recall he describes swabbing the 
14 gun. And now I think we're going to take up from 
15 there and Detective , if you want to sit in 
16 that chair.

18 
19 off. 
A 
Q 
Thank you. 
We will kind of resume where we had left 
20 I think previously you testified that 
21 when Darren Wilson had left the Ferguson Police 
22 Department to go to the hospital, he had draped his 
23 uniform shirt over a chair, I believe or do you 
24 recall? 
25 A I didn't testify to that.

Okay. Somebody else did, I'm sorry. 
Yes, ma'am. His uniform shirt and his 
3 department issued weapon were still at Ferguson 
4 Police Department. He was still wearing his white 
5 T-shirt, his brown uniform pants and his boots.

15 photograph and seize the officer's clothing?

10 you have time because it is easier to see, but at 
11 the time that you are examining this shirt and 
12 looking at it, did you know what that pinkish red

And a presumptive test will show you what? 
It is a two-part test. Once you moisten 
8 your two swabs with the first agent and then swab 
9 this area, you remoisten it with a second reagent. 
10 If it turns a bright color of pink, it is 
11 presumptive for blood. 
12 It's not positive because that's 
13 what -- we can't do that, but I did not get a 
14 positive reaction. And based on the color and my 
15 training and experience I was pretty confident at 
16 the time that it wasn't blood, however, if I'm going 
17 to be able to testify to the results of that, then I 
18 have to do a presumptive blood test. I can't just 
19 automatically say, well, that's not blood. 
20 So that's why we confirm this and did 
21 not have a positive reaction with phenolphtaleine. 
22 Phenolphtaleine, which is as I explained, a two-part 
23 presumptive test. I did not get a positive 
24 reaction, so it was not blood.

2 about that he wore the pants back to the police 
3 station, did he ultimately remove the pants for you 
4 to examine and photograph? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
He did. 
Is that what we're seeing in this image? 
These are the image of his unform pants 
8 that are displayed. Officer Wilson or Darren Wilson 
9 did tell me that there was blood on his pants. It 
10 is easier to see when you look at these photographs 
11 at your convenience, but my orange indicator is 
12 pointing to the area which did have red stains on it 
13 that was identified by Darren at the time of my 
14 investigation. 
15 So the pants were removed, he changed 
16 into other clothes, the pants were displayed just 
17 like his uniform shirt and for orientation purposes, 
18 and that is why I put that orange indicator in there 
19 so it draws your eye to the center of the photograph 
20 so you know what the focal point of that is. 
21 Q And so that would be on the left leg. Are 
22 we looking at the front or the back of his pants? 
23 A It is the front, it is his upper left 
24 thigh area. 
25 Q Okay. And then showing you your Image 33.

11 that it was blood.

3 area. 
4 So when that vehicle was escorted by 
5 me, it was unloaded, placed in our processing area 
6 and I completed the processing of their police

24 has flexible mirrors that was an area of concern.

1 door. I had already been informed that Darren 
2 Wilson had fired a round through the door, so I had 
3 a certain defect in the driver's door. 
4 I was requested to fingerprint the 
5 outside of the door and also swab for potential DNA 
6 sources on the top edge of the door where the window 
7 comes out of the door there is a rubber strip there. 
8 And also there was some red stains, which we 
9 believed to be blood on the inside of the driver's 
10 door. So all of that was completed in my

17 you folks to see, so please look at it later when

2 A No, ma'am. That's not a conducive surface 
3 for me to get a decent fingerprint evidence. It is 
4 rough, there could be some other foreign materials 
5 on it when it was cleaned. I really need a decent

5 Q Now, starting with Image Number 43, can 
6 you describe what you're seeing and what those 
7 things are on the edge of the car. Let's do this. 
8 A As asked, the exterior of 
9 that is processed with fingerprint powder. Once I 
10 developed latent fingerprint evidence, then those 
11 lifts are removed by placing lifting tape on there. 
12 We also photograph those latent lifts in place and 
13 our system is that there are always, we always use 
14 letters on latent lifts and we try to use numbers on 
15 evidence. 
16 So every one of those is numbered A 
17 through E. and they're always photographed in place. 
18 This was the area that I developed 
19 latent fingerprint evidence and so based on the 
20 information that I received, that's where we 
21 determined to be the best area that they were 
22 concerned about as far as retrieving latent 
23 fingerprint. 
24 Q Now, the tape that you see in these 
25 photographs, when you remove that from the surface

1 of the vehicle, what do you do with that tape in 
2 order to preserve it? 
3 A They're placed on what's referred to as a 
4 liftback. In essence, it is a bright white card. 
5 So you would have contrast or latent fingerprint 
6 examiners can compare that to known or ink

2 Q Did you process any other part of the 
3 vehicle for fingerprints? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
No, I did not. 
I'm going to show you your Image Number 
6 44. Can you describe what we see in there? 
7 A Once we had photographed the outer part of 
8 the interior door panel, in order to retrieve that 
9 projectile, that door panel was removed. 
10 Also when that projectile went 
11 through there, it also damaged part of the inner 
12 door skin. And also went through and struck the 
13 outside of the door, which I believe another 
14 detective had photographed. It looks like a bump. 
15 So once I retrieved that projectile 
16 and there is some other documentation there also in 
17 the bottom of this, so we have overall view of it. 
18 All of that glass I had to sift through in order to 
19 retrieve that projectile. 
20 So to tie this into a photographic 
21 series, we take an overall view of the door, meaning 
22 the source of where we recover the projectile from. 
23 We orange triangle by indicator in that pile of 
24 glass is where I retrieved the projectile after 
25 scooping all of this out from inside of the door.

Q 
7 panel? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
All down in there, yes. 
Down in this area, but behind this metal 
Right. 
So you had to actually scoop it out with a 
10 tool or with your hands? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
My hands. 
As you scoop it out, are you just dumping 
13 it on the ground then or does it fall on the ground 
14 there? 
15 A No, I'm taking out small handfuls by small 
16 handfuls. I don't want to lose anything else, maybe 
17 this projectile fragmented, maybe there are sharp 
18 edges to it. So we're very cognizant as far as 
19 trying to retrieve as much evidence as we can. 
20 The good thing for me as an 
21 investigator is the projectile is pretty much 
22 intact. So we didn't have a lot of small, minute 
23 pieces of metal that were not directly related to 
24 that projectile. 
25 So as I'm doing it, I'm carefully

1 putting in a pile, going through every handful. 
2 When I finally retrieved, determine that it was a 
3 projectile. It is left right there and we start our 
4 sequence as far as taking photographs. 
5 Q So showing you your Image Number 45, what 
6 do you see in that image? 
7 A This is an overall view of where that 
8 projectile, once it went through that plastic door 
9 panel entered the interior metal skin of that door. 
10 Is just an overall view of it. The 
11 focal point in the center of the photograph will be 
12 right about here, which you will see when you get 
13 further into the seats.

Image 46? 
This is a closer view of it. The area of 
16 concern is right here. (indicating) 
17 Q And so a little clearer, actually, looking 
18 at the image with your own eyes. 
19 I guess from the very top of it, 
20 maybe at the one or two o'clock position, there is a 
21 defect on the metal? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. Showing you Number 47? 
That's a closer view with the scale next

Q So when you could see the car in your 
3 garage, could you see that defect that was on the 
4 outside of the door? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, it was pushed out or bowing out. 
And does the location of that defect 
7 correspond with where that mark, the defect was on 
8 the my of the insides of the door? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
I would say it is consistent. 
Okay. You didn't take any measurements to 
11 or anything to determine? 
12 
13 
14 48. 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
No, ma'am. 
Okay. All right. Showing you your Image 
This is a closer view, one of a series as 
16 far as we orientated originally as far as the 
17 source. The interior of the door, we have the pile 
18 of glass that I had gone through, the projectile 
19 with the orange indicator, and that was just a 
20 closer view of the same area with the indicator and 
21 projectile. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Image 49? 
This is a close-up view of it. Again, the 
24 indicator and the projectile recovered hasn't moved. 
25 It is just a closer view of it.

Q 
Right here. 
You recognize that as a spent projectile? 
Yes. 
So what did you do with that projectile 
10 once you found it? 
11 A It was packaged, marked and forwarded to 
12 our firearms examiner. 
13 Q And is that the same place where you 
14 forwarded the weapon and the pieces of the weapon, 
15 the magazine and the spent round?

Q 
Correct. 
Not spent round, a live round? 
Live round. 
Okay. Did you do any testing to determine 
20 if there was any substance on that spent projectile? 
21 A No, I wouldn't do that. Our firearms 
22 examiner would do that. 
23 Q So if there is blood or anything on there 
24 that's not something that you would have looked at 
25 or tested for?

7 MS. ALIZADEH: Or Thursday. So we are 
8 chugging along. Any questions anybody has or any 
9 concerns? And I hear, I'm going to meet with Bob 
10 McCulloch about maybe communicating with people out 
11 there about the process of the grand jury and why it 
12 is not going to be done this Friday and so forth. 
13 I think 
14 he has done pretty much getting it out there. I 
15 think the community leaders need to back him up and 
16 confirm what he's saying, I mean. I'm quite sure 
17 the process is written somewhere in the book or law 
18 books or whatever and it is pretty out there what 
19 the process is, they just need to tell, I think, the 
20 community to try and get some stability back into 
21 the community. 
22 This is what, this is what they're doing, 
23 this is what they need to do. I mean, if I were in 
24 Michael Brown's or Darren Wilson's shoes, I would 
25 want somebody to know everything before you make a

1 decision what happens to me or my life or what I did 
2 or what I didn't do. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: And that was, you know, 
4 Mr. McCulloch's, pledge at the very beginning that 
5 you all would hear everything. I know it is very 
6 tedious at times, but as you are beginning to see, 
7 there is a lot of people that see different bits and 
8 pieces, a lot of different viewpoints, a lot of 
9 different statements and so, you know, it is going 
10 to be up to you guys to sift through that. We don't 
11 want to leave anything out. Down the road after 
12 this decision is made, I don't want somebody saying, 
13 well, you didn't call this person. 
14 But as far as the community leaders, you 
15 know, that's going to be something that is up to 
16 Mr. McCulloch. And as you know, there have been a 
17 lot of those same people have called for him to 
18 recuse himself and not be the prosecutor on this 
19 case. I don't know what kind of communication would 
20 happen between them if there would be, but I hear 
21 you and I know what you're saying. But ultimately, 
22 Sheila and I are we're just doing this part of it, 
23 it will be up to Mr. McCulloch to decide how to 
24 handles that kind of public relations issue.

1 though. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
3 Could you maybe 
4 just do a little research too to see if there has 
5 and how common it is that a grand jury would release 
6 a statement with their ultimate decision at the end? 
7 I don't know that we would ever want to, but it 
8 might be an option to help calm things or a thought. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: It is funny that you say 
10 that and I think, I don't know if you guys have 
11 asked that before. I mean, I have been here 26 
12 years and, urn, actually even before Bob McCulloch 
13 was the elected prosecutor. And never in my 
14 experience, now I know that we have had several 
15 grand juries conduct investigations into excessive 
16 force involving police officers, whether it be 
17 shootings, whether it be homicide or an assault 
18 where a person wasn't killed, I'm not aware of ever 
19 being a statement released after the grand jury has 
20 made its determination. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: I'm sorry, Kathi, let me 
22 make sure I understand. Were you suggesting that a 
23 grand juror would make a statement? 
24 I'm not actually 
25 suggesting that we want to, just was wondering if it

1 ever happened or was that in the history of that or 
2 kind of like you were going through what the debate 
3 time we would also continue if we didn't have a 
4 certain number going to look into that. I'm curious 
5 as well if there had been any historical point of 
6 grand juries doing that. I don't even know if we 
7 would even want to. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm not aware of anything 
9 like that ever happening. 
10 I don't think, one thing, 
11 I don't want them to know me or know anything. I 
12 don't want anything out there. 
13 Yeah, we would never make 
14 a statement with names. 
15 But for me, I don't want 
16 nothing to do with any release, the press, the news. 
17 Just to be clear, it 
18 wouldn't be an individual statement.

22 you as to what your duties and obligations are. I 
23 don't know how that extends beyond your term. Like, 
24 you know, I know when we have a trial, the jury is 
25 told they can't discuss this with anyone, but at the

1 conclusion of the trial that admonition is lifted 
2 and they're told you can discuss this with whomever 
3 you wish or not at all, it is up to you. 
4 I haven't seen what the charge is that the 
5 grand jury gets. I don't know that if the grand 
6 jury is allowed to talk about this after the fact. 
7 I'm not sure about that and we can look into that, 
8 but what I'm guessing or I'm thinking, and you all, 
9 you know, again, there's nothing written in stone 
10 right now, but you are talking about the possibility 
11 as the grand jury as a group preparing some kind of 
12 formal statement that would accompany your decision. 
13 And it wouldn't be like your names would be attached 
14 to it, you would agree on some kind of statement 
15 that you would want to make about whatever you would 
16 want the public to know about that. 
17 I'm not aware of that ever happening and 
18 so I'll look into that to see if that's even 
19 possible. Obviously, if they say no because your 
20 admonition is not lifted after, then you can't talk 
21 about your, the process and your deliberations and 
22 the evidence that you heard. 
23 So I will look into that.
