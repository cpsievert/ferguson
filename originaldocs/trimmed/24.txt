GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXIV 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morn1ng. It lS 
3 Friday, November 21st, it is 9:24 a.m. This is 
4 Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, all 12 
5 grand jurors are present, as 1s the court reporter. 
6 And we've spent about an hour kind of 
7 talking about some procedural issues and matters and 
8 concerns that the grand jurors had. 
9 We did not discuss any of the evidence or 
10 testimony so that discussion was had not on the 
11 record. 
12 I do want to tell you that as, s1nce you 
13 last met, which was on Thursday, last week, I've 
14 taken this week to go through every transcript that 
15 has been produced, which we are up-to-date. We have 
16 the transcript from last Thursday and what I've done 
17 is I made a chart and I made a chart that had the 
18 name of every witness who testified and whether or 
19 not that witness made statements prior to their 
20 testimony. 
21 As you know, it was originally our plan 
22 that we would put on witness statements prior to the 
23 witness testifying. We play statements, we provide 
24 transcripts when we had them, but over the weeks 
25 because of scheduling issues and problems getting 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 5 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 witnesses in, we kind of got away from that. We'll 
2 put the witness on now and we'll listen to their 
3 statements later. 
4 I wanted to make sure that I had put 
5 everything on and, of course, I discovered that I'm 
6 not perfect and we have not, so I want to make this 
7 representation to y'all. 
8 And, aga1n, names of witnesses will be 
9 redacted from the transcripts, so I'm just going to 
10 go ahead and say their names. But if you will 
11 recall, there was a witness testified, her name 1s 
12 She is the 
13 and she did testify and I did play a statement of 
14 hers that was taken on the date of the shooting by 
15 the St. Louis County Police Department and that 
16 statement was three minutes long. 
17 Apparently there is another statement of 
18 hers that was given to the FBI on September 2nd and 
19 that statement is 11 minutes and 58 seconds. I did 
20 not play that, but I have it hear, all right. 
21 So I'm going to go through each of these 
22 and then we will discuss whether or not you want us 
23 to play or give you just the transcripts of what 
24 have you. 
25 There was another witness or another young 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 6 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 man who did not testify, but you'll recall 
2 he originally made a statement 
3 to St. Louis County Police on the day of the 
4 shooting. It was a ten-minute recorded statement 
5 that we played for you where he described having 
6 witnessed the incident. 
7 testified last week about a 
8 phone call and we played a phone call for you from 
9 that witness where he said, no, he really didn't see 
10 it, he just said he saw it. So there is another 
11 statement of that was given to the 
12 joint investigators, so United States attorney, 
13 Justice Department attorney and FBI people, that was 
14 given on September 26th. It's 15 minutes and 58 
15 seconds long, and I did not play that one for you. 
16 I have listened to it and actually that's how I knew 
17 was recanting the story. The essence 
18 of that statement he says, I didn't really see it. 
19 
20 here. 
But that statement is also, I have it in 
So we can play that for you if you want to 
21 hear that one. 
22 There was a woman testified named 
23 , she's the one who, I believe, was taking 
24 her trash out when she heard the shots. She made 
25 two statements, one on August 9th on the date of the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 7 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 shooting and one on August 16th to the FBI. During 
2 their canvas, remember the week after they did a 
3 knock on door canvas? 
4 I have given you those two transcripts 
5 already, and at the time you all said you didn't 
6 need to hear the statement, the statement played 
7 because you have the transcripts. 
8 But again, I have those statements here 
9 and if you desire to hear them, we can play them. 
10 Then there's , you will 
11 remember she's the woman from who was 
12 taking a drive into Canfield Apartment Complex and 
13 testified that she witnessed the shooting. I've 
14 already played for you a statement that she made to 
15 the joint investigators, the U.S. attorney, 
16 Department of Justice attorney and FBI agents. That 
17 statement was on October 22nd. It was an hour and 
18 38 minutes long and there was no transcript of the 
19 statement at that time, but the court reporter took 
20 down the statement as we played it, and so you've 
21 heard that statement. 
22 There is another statement that was made 
23 previously by her on September 11th to the St. Louis 
24 County Police Department, that statement is 44 
25 minutes and 52 seconds long. I don't have a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 8 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 transcript of that statement, but I have that audio 
2 if you want to hear that as well. 
3 There was witness if you 
4 recall, he was kind of like, he said he was kind of 
5 like the godson to He was on his 
6 balcony trying to make a cell phone call because he 
7 gets better reception out on his balcony. 
8 He made a statement that I played for you 
9 on September 30th. It was a statement made to joint 
10 investigators. It was 33 minutes and 14 seconds 
11 long. And you've already heard that one and have a 
12 transcript of that. 
13 He also made a statement on the day of the 
14 FBI's canvas on August 16th and that statement is 22 
15 minutes and 31 seconds. And I have that statement, 
16 but I have not played it for you, nor do I have a 
17 transcript. 
18 I don't know if you recall 
19 , she's the witness who says she likes 
20 her gospel mus1c and she was rocking to the gospel 
21 mus1c 1n her car when she pulled into the complex 
22 that day and witnessed the shooting from behind, 
23 from inside her vehicle. 
24 She made a statement to joint 
25 investigators that statement was made on 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 9 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 August 15th, 2014. 
2 At the time I asked you if you wanted to 
3 hear y'all told me you didn't think you wanted to, 
4 but I have the transcripts already prepared at that 
5 time because I was thinking we would play it. So at 
6 this time I'll pass out the transcripts for her 
7 statement and y'all can have those and if you want 
8 to hear her statement, we can play that one as well. 
9 Then there was , he's the 
10 gentleman who was making internet kind of video 
11 phone call to a female friend and he unwittingly 
12 recorded the sounds of gunshots, and I didn't play 
13 his statement. His statement was given to the FBI 
14 on August 18th, it is ten minutes and 41 seconds 
15 long. I don't have a transcript, but I do have that 
16 statement if you want to listen to it. 
17 There 1s , he's the 
18 witness who had called into that POD cast show, that 
19 and had made statements that 
20 seem to indicate that he had seen the shooting. And 
21 he came in and testified to you about what he saw. 
22 He made a statement to St. Louis County 
23 Police and the FBI actually on the day that he 
24 testified in the grand jury because he would not 
25 make a statement to the police he actually was 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 10 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 subpoenaed to come into grand jury to testify. 
2 So when he arrived at our office, FBI 
3 
4 
agent and then sat down with him and 
took his statement and that's recorded. I don't 
5 have a transcript, but I do have the statement, that 
6 statement is 53 minutes and three seconds, so if you 
7 want to hear that one you can. 
8 , she was the physician 
9 assistant who treated Officer Wilson on the day of 
10 the shooting. 
11 She made a statement to joint 
12 investigators on August 27th of 2014. Her statement 
13 was recorded and is 16 minutes and 29 seconds long. 
14 I don't have a transcript, but I have a statement if 
15 you want to hear that. 
16 made a statement to joint 
17 investigators on the 9th before he testified 1n this 
18 grand jury. So that would have been on 
19 November 12th and his statement is two hours and 40 
20 minutes long if you would like to hear that. 
21 Actually, I do have a transcript, they delivered the 
22 
23 
transcript to me as well. 
and that statement. 
So I have a transcript 
24 I didn't print out the transcript because 
25 obviously it is quite voluminous. If you need it, I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 11 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 will certainly print out cop1es for everyone. 
2 And then finally , she was 
3 the woman who was in the vehicle with her mom and 
4 dad and sister and her daughter, she made two 
5 statements. Neither of which have been played to 
6 you. One was on August 21st to the St. Louis County 
7 Police, that's 19 minutes and 15 seconds long. And 
8 the other one was to joint investigators and that 
9 was made, I think, the day before she came in and 
10 testified here, that would be November 12th. And 
11 that statement is 35 minutes and 45 seconds long. 
12 And maybe at a morn1ng break, I'm go1ng to 
13 g1ve this chart to the foreperson. I've highlighted 
14 the ones missing statements so you guys can talk 
15 amongst yourselves if there 1s any need to hear 
16 those statements or get transcripts for those 
17 statements, we can do that before you deliberate. 
18 GRAND JUROR: Whatever happened to the 
19 
20 
witness somebody who didn't want to come? 
MS. ALIZADEH: we never were 
21 able to get him subpoenaed. He's hung up on me 
22 twice, he hung up on the Department of Justice 
23 attorney twice, they've not been able to get him 1n 
24 for an interview. 
25 I've had an investigator to his home, to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 12 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 his mother's home, and either people don't answer 
2 the door or when they answer the door they say 
3 isn't here. 
4 Police are not authorized to go into a 
5 house and look for somebody unless they have a 
6 search warrant. And given that he's not, he hasn't 
7 committed a crime, we really can't get a search 
8 warrant to go into a house to find him. 
9 So, you know, I did play his statement for 
10 you to take into consideration the fact that he 1s 
11 unwilling to come in and give live testimony to you. 
12 When you consider how many witnesses have 
13 g1ven different statements after they come in and 
14 testify, just keep that in mind, that you were able 
15 to question him and observe him and judge his 
16 credibility live, okay. 
17 GRAND JUROR: I have one more question. 
18 What would be the reason that a police department or 
19 the FBI or the civil rights will get a statement at 
20 the 9th hour before the witness comes in to testify? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, that would be a 
22 question that you would have to ask them. You know, 
23 as you know, they're running their own 
24 investigation, independent investigation and as you 
25 probably, you might be able to tell even by looking, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 13 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 I didn't g1ve you the whole list. I left out a 
2 page. 
3 A lot of these witnesses who were spoken 
4 to were spoken to by either county police officers 
5 on the day of the shooting or the day after the 
6 shooting and then sometimes on that following 
7 weekend when the FBI did their canvas they were 
8 spoken to. 
9 Some of these interviews are as short as 
10 three minutes. As an example, I'll use 
11 She was interviewed by a county detective 
12 on the date of the shooting. I think her interview 
13 was something like three minutes. Not very 
14 detailed. Not very, you know, there isn't even 
15 anything in her statement at that time as to what 
16 car she was driving. 
17 
18 
19 
As you know, that kind of became an 1ssue. 
She testified she had the and that 
kind of is an 1ssue. I'm only speculating as to the 
20 reason that they were conducting their own 
21 interviews. I think that definitely witnesses 
22 needed more 1n depth interviews and they determined 
23 they were going to do those, but I can't really tell 
24 you, it would be speculating on my part if they had 
25 any other kind of motive or desire, but they are 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 14 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 running their own investigation. They will, they 
2 are prepar1ng a report with recommendations of their 
3 own so they feel a need to actually talk to every 
4 witness themselves. 
5 Okay. Also we did not have it at the 
6 time, but actually emailed a copy of his 
7 CV after he testified, so I marked that as Exhibit 
8 103. 
9 (Deposition Exhibit Number 103 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And at this time we'll 
12 proceed with who I anticipate may be the last 
13 witness and that's who started 
14 last Thursday. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I have one quick question. 
16 referenced his report, do we not 
17 anticipate getting one from his autopsy? 
18 
19 
20 done. 
21 
22 
MS. WHIRLEY: We don't have one currently. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't even know if it's 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You know, honestly, during 
23 the break we can try to contact him if it 1s done, 
24 he maybe can email it to us, and if it 1s not done. 
25 GRAND JUROR: I asked about 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 15 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 report. He mentioned finishing up his report and we 
2 never saw anything. If that 1s of interest of 
3 people to inquire into it or not? 
4 GRAND JUROR: What do you mean he didn't 
5 saw everything? 
6 GRAND JUROR: He never submitted his 
7 report from his autopsy. He referenced he looked at 
8 some pictures when. 
9 GRAND JUROR: He should have written his 
10 report by now. 
11 GRAND JUROR: This lS it, he didn't submit 
12 his autopsy report. 
13 
14 
MS. WHIRLEY: We'll contact and see. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is worth us reaching out 
15 if he's got it and can email to us we'll get it. If 
16 he doesn't, you know, the only thing would be y'all 
17 would have to discuss if you want to hold up your 
18 deliberations until you get it. This is, aga1n, 
19 your investigation and if there 1s something you 
20 think you need, we're going to get it for you. 
21 
22 
MS. WHIRLEY: Another question? 
GRAND JUROR: We need to decide even if we 
23 need to ask for it. 
24 GRAND JUROR: I thought the only reason 
25 that we would have it is because he was, he had a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 16 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 difference of opinion as to one of the wounds as 
2 opposed to the medical examiner for St. Louis 
3 County, 1s that my understanding? Was that my 
4 understanding? 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: That's something you need to 
6 figure out. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
MS. ALIZADEH: We can't --
GRAND JUROR: I'm sorry? 
MS. ALIZADEH: We've got email. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I can reach out to him. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: We can make quick inquiry. 
12 If he's got it, we'll get. If he doesn't have it, 
13 you guys are going to have to decide if you want to 
14 hold up deliberations until you get it. It 1s easy. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I'm not sure that everything 
16 that we've done so far 1s thorough if we would make 
17 a decision before we have his report that that would 
18 
19 
not reflect good on us, you know what I mean? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let me tell you this. In 
20 any actual criminal trial, the report of the medical 
21 examiner, the police reports, any reports that you 
22 all have been g1ven 1n your investigation, none of 
23 those or admissible 1n a trial because the report 
24 itself is considered hearsay. 
25 The testimony is the evidence in the case. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 17 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 So has now, typically we have a report 
2 before the witness testifies and we may use that 
3 report to prepare us for their testimony, and then 
4 we may use that report if they testify differently 
5 than what the report says certainly, but in this 
6 case, we didn't have that report in advance. 
7 If we had it and it was a trial, we 
8 couldn't let the jury see it anyway, but that's 
9 something, again, you guys are go1ng to have to talk 
10 about. During this break, we'll go and do, we'll 
11 contact somebody right now. If we get it great, if 
12 we don't get it, you are going to have to decide if 
13 you want to wait for the report, okay. And that 
14 will be the decision you all can make amongst 
15 yourselves during the break or lunch or what have 
16 you. Okay. 
17 Anything else before we take a bathroom 
18 break or stretch your legs? 
19 (Recess) 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley. 
21 There was a request regarding autopsy 
22 report. Fortunately I was able to reach him by 
23 telephone during our break. He said that he was 
24 waiting on some information and hadn't completed the 
25 report, but he could have it ready by Monday. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 18 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 So he wanted me to get back to him and 
2 he'll work on it over the weekend. He wanted me to 
3 get back to him and let him know if that would be 
4 okay, should he work on it or what. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Why don't you guys talk 
6 about it during your lunch break. We'll let him 
7 know after lunch whether he needs to chop-chop, get 
8 that done for you guys, okay. 
9 So at this time, we're go1ng to recall 
10 Detective 
11 DETECTIVE 
12 having previously been sworn, retakes the stand for 
13 further questioning.

A 
Q 
Good morn1ng, Detective 
Good morn1ng. 
This will be your third time appear1ng on 
19 this matter in the grand Jury and I will just remind 
20 you, you are still under oath to tell the truth and 
21 also that you are under oath not to divulge or 
22 disclose anything that happens in the grand Jury or 
23 to even discuss that you were appearing at the grand 
24 Jury or any matters or for the fact that they have 
25 this matter under consideration.

Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014

2 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So, I first want to clear something up, 
3 and this actually came about at the conclusion of 
4 your day on Thursday, and we were not done with your 
5 testimony, but there was a question asked by Sheila 
6 Whirley and I wanted to clarify something. 
7 Last Thursday I had asked you 
8 questions about your investigation, about your 
9 questioning of Officer Wilson, your reasons for not 
10 placing him under arrest after you had interviewed 
11 him, the reason you did not place him under arrest 
12 sometime subsequent to that and I asked you if you 
13 felt that you had probable cause after you had 
14 interviewed him, if you felt that at that time that 
15 you had probable cause to arrest him, and your 
16 answer I believe was no. 
17 At that time you did not feel that 
18 you did and I want to clarify for the grand JUrors 
19 and Sheila brought up the fact, you are not say1ng, 
20 are you, Detective, that you do not feel that 
21 there's probable cause to indict Officer Wilson of 
22 any offense in this case? 
23 A Correct, I'm not g1v1ng that op1n1on. 
24 Q In fact, in preparation for your 
25 testimony, did we discuss whether or not any 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 20 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 questions about your op1n1on would be answered by 
2 you? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
We did discuss that, yes. 
And I told you that I would not want you 
5 to g1ve your own op1n1on if you have one, nor would 
6 I want any of the grand jurors to ask you your 
7 opinion because that is actually their decision and 
8 not yours? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct, yes. 
So just to clarify for everybody, your 
11 answer about not arresting Officer Wilson after he 
12 was interviewed, which was less than 24 hours after 
13 the actual shooting incident was not a comment on 
14 your part as to whether you feel that there's 
15 probable cause to indict, is that fair to say? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
And you all understand that at no time do 
18 I think would it be appropriate for you to ask his 
19 op1n1on as to whether there is probable cause to 
20 indict. 
21 Also, you may recall that during 
22 testimony of certain witnesses they may have been 
23 asked questions about their opinion as to whether 
24 there was excess1ve force used and in those cases, 
25 those witnesses, if you recall, were all actual 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 21 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 eyewitnesses to the incident. And so whether they 
2 have an opinion or not I think might be relevant, 
3 but given that Detective is not witness to 
4 the incident, I don't feel it is appropriate for you 
5 to ask him his opinion as to any of the issues in 
6 this case. 
7 He's here to testify about the 
8 investigation and the facts that he's discovered and 
9 I leave it to you to determine the issues of law 1n 
10 this case. 
11 Also, Detective after your 
12 testimony you indicated to me that I had asked you a 
13 question about whether or not the investigation you 
14 conducted in this case was any different than any 
15 other investigation you've done regarding use of 
16 force investigations, and I believe you testified 
17 Thursday that no, you have not done anything 
18 differently or something to that effect. And you 
19 told me that you wanted to clarify that; is that 
20 fair? 
21 A I did, yes. 
22 Q Why don't you explain for the grand jurors 
23 about what, if anything, is different about your 
24 investigation in this case? 
25 A Sure. When I answered that question last 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 22 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 week, I was referring to the fact that Darren Wilson 
2 was treated no differently in this investigation 
3 than other officers have been treated in any other 
4 investigation we have conducted or that I have 
5 conducted. 
6 He received no special treatment and 
7 1n terms of the investigation, the same legal and 
8 general procedural guidelines were followed in this 
9 investigation as they were in any other officer 
10 involved incident that I have conducted. 
11 Having said that from the beginning, 
12 there were certain aspects of the investigation that 
13 were different. Typically we would do a 
14 walk-through at the scene with the individual 
15 involved in the incident, that wasn't possible 1n 
16 this particular instance based off of circumstances 
17 taking place at the scene. It wouldn't have been 
18 safe, I felt, for him to go back to the scene and do 
19 a walk-through at the scene. In a relatively short 
20 period of time, there was a significant amount of 
21 media attention that had been garnered regarding 
22 this incident and obviously, that can impact 
23 witnesses' statements if a witness sees media 
24 account of it, so that would have obviously impacted 
25 this investigation more so than previous 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 23 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 investigations. The FBI and Department of Justice, 
2 obviously, began conducting a parallel investigation 
3 within a relatively short period of time. And that 
4 obviously lent itself to a variety of coordination 
5 issues that needed to happen, a variety of other 
6 laboratory reports that we would have needed to get, 
7 other methods of doing things. In that sense, there 
8 were things that we did differently. 
9 And also just in terms of the sheer 
10 volume of work and the amount of witnesses that we 
11 contacted that was different in this particular 
12 instance, based on the amount of people that needed 
13 to be contacted, the amount of evidence that was 
14 presented. And so in some instances, I was at the 
15 same time as much a project manager as I was an 
16 investigator. 
17 But ultimately there were a lot of 
18 things that were, I should say, different about this 
19 investigation, but it is nothing that would have 
20 impacted the integrity of the investigation or the 
21 manner 1n which Darren Wilson was treated, so I just 
22 wanted to clarify that. 
23 Q All right. And 1n the course of this 
24 investigation within hours of the shooting, you did 
25 have a number of people who actually came forward 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 24 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and indicated that they had witnessed the incident; 
2 1s that correct? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And you learned shortly after the shooting 
5 that there was an individual who was with Mike Brown 
6 during the shooting and did it take several days for 
7 you to identify him and to contact him? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
It did. 
And then during this investigation were 
10 there also a number of witnesses that did not come 
11 forward that you were able to later identify either 
12 through canvass1ng or through other investigative 
13 techniques such as getting phone records, Facebook 
14 records, Twitter records and so forth, to try to 
15 locate people who might have seen something? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes, that's correct. 
And so is that something that was atypical 
18 1n your investigation of an officer involved 
19 shooting the vast number of witnesses that actually 
20 were not coming forward on their own? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
It was, yes. 
Urn, all right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm go1ng to then kind of 
24 resume with talking about this perspective picture. 
25 At this time does anybody have any questions, of 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 25 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 course, you can always ask later as well. Before I 
2 move on to doing these pictures again, anybody have 
3 questions about the investigation itself or things 
4 that were done or not done? 
5 Okay, all right. So now, Detective 
6 we had you testify Thursday about this map, 
7 which is marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 101. What 
8 are these? 
9 A Extra. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Extra, okay, that's 
11 right. And you indicated that you, along with other 
12 investigators prepared this, which is your 
13 interpretation based upon the statements made of 
14 witnesses as to where various eyewitnesses were 
15 during, when I say shooting, obviously, there was a 
16 time period that goes along, the beginning of the 
17 time of the beginning of the incident until after 
18 the shooting had been done. And do you still feel 
19 that this map accurately reflects where witnesses 
20 said they were? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I do. 
And just for your instruction, this just, 
23 this map is for your purposes in your deliberations 
24 and if you disagree with anything that's on the map, 
25 these little sticky things come right off. So 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 26 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 supposedly they come right off. 
2 A They do. 
3 Q If you feel that this witness is not in 
4 the right place, you can move any of these stickers 
5 that you want and put them in the places where you 
6 think they belong. 
7 This 1s just something that is 
8 representative of what this witness believes where 
9 people were. If you all do with this what you will. 
10 Also there was a legend that was 
11 provided for all of you regarding the numbers 
12 because the numbers that were assigned witnesses are 
13 not the same numbers as the witnesses testimony in 
14 this grand Jury. 
15 So Witness Number 10 in the grand 
16 Jury 1s not necessarily Number 10 on this chart. 
17 Actually, he's Number 6. So those numbers for the 
18 map are only for the map, okay. Is that fair to 
19 everybody? 
20 All right. Now 
21 GRAND JUROR: I just want to clarify, the 
22 red where it says Michael Brown, that is where he 
23 died, that is where he fell? 
24 
25 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: You don't indicate anywhere 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 27 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 where he was to begin with, just where he fell? 
2 A Just where he fell, yes. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the blue would be 
4 where the police officer's car was when you began 
5 your investigation, correct? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So these photographs, which we already 
8 started some testimony about, I did a little better 
9 job attaching them. And just so for the grand jury 
10 to understand what I've done here, I have three 
11 boards and each board represents a vantage point. 
12 So the actual vantage point, the picture of that 
13 vantage point is on the back of the board. 
14 So as you see here on the back of 
15 this board, there 1s a cone in the middle of the 
16 street. That would be where the police vehicle was. 
17 And so when you then look at the pictures that are 
18 on front of the board, and you've heard Detective 
19 testify about how the photographer stood 1n 
20 that location over that cone, actually stood, 
21 straddled the cone and would take pictures moving 
22 clockwise 360, so that we would have an idea of what 
23 can be seen from that vantage point to help you 
24 figure out where people were, what they might have 
25 seen, parts of it they might have seen. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 28 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 And actually, when I prepared these 
2 boards, I did it us1ng what's called removable tape 
3 because I wanted y'all to be able to take these 
4 pictures off if you needed to or move them around if 
5 you needed to. But unfortunately, removable tape 
6 doesn't stay very well and the next day I came 1n 
7 and these pictures were like all on the floor. 
8 As you see they're coming off 
9 somewhat and so I've provided a tape dispenser for 
10 you. If you see that, see how this is coming off 
11 here. This is because this tape doesn't stick well. 
12 I'm taking these down so they stay. 
13 You should be able to pull them off. If there is a 
14 need to remove them and move them around 1n any way. 
15 But I believe we finished up with 
16 this board which I did not mark last week, but I'm 
17 going to mark now. 
18 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 104 
19 marked for identification.) 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody have, before 
21 anybody I move onto the next board, we kind of 
22 finished with the last picture. Anybody have any 
23 other questions about this board? 
24 And just so you all know too, you will see 
25 that there are, I think, five easels in this room 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 29 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 right now. There 1s one 1n the corner that's 
2 holding that flip chart, one that's in this corner. 
3 The one I just put up there, there's another one in 
4 the corner and one over here. 
5 So when it 1s time for you to deliberate, 
6 if you feel like you want to get all of these out 
7 and put them up, it is just hard for me to move 
8 around by doing it right now. 
9 I'm just go1ng to do them one at a time. 
10 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 105 
11 marked for identification.) 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Next board I'm going to 
13 mark Grand Jury Exhibit 105. 
14 Again, I put the picture on the back of 
15 the board that shows the vantage point of these 
16 pictures. You see a cone in that picture, and 
17 Detective looking at the photos on the front 
18 of the board. Can you tell what vantage point that 
19 is? 
20 A This would be the far eastern point that 
21 we took, the 360 degree photos from. 
22 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And why 1s it that this 
23 cone was placed at that location on Canfield Drive 
24 or Canfield Road? 
25 A As best we could tell based off of witness 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 30 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 accounts, that would have been the furthest point 
2 east that Michael Brown would have went to. So that 
3 intersection of roughly Coppercreek Court and 
4 Canfield Drive. 
5 Q If you want to point to where that 1s on 
6 your other map? 
7 A So essentially the western corner, or what 
8 would be the northwestern corner, I should say, of 
9 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive is where this 
10 cone was placed roughly right about there. 
11 (indicating) 
12 Q And so we see 1n the photograph that is on 
13 the back of this board, the cone there, did the 
14 photographer straddle that cone and take 360 
15 photographs in the same manner that she did from the 
16 vantage point from where the police vehicle had 
17 been? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Same procedure was used, yes. 
Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Is this from the 
21 perspective, you said from the farthest point that 
22 the Michael Brown got to, is this the point where he 
23 stopped in the roadway and turned? 
24 A Yes, ma'am. We are basing that off of 
25 witness statements as best we could tell. That was 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 31 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the point that they had made reference to and so we 
2 used that as the furthest eastern point to go to. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, I'm go1ng to put 
3 
4 
5 this up, Detective. If you want to come up here if 
6 it is easier for you to see. We're go1ng to start 
7 with the top left-hand photo is the first photo 1n 
8 the group and then we're going to move left to 
9 right, and then down to the second row left to right 
10 and then down to the third row left to right. 
11 So the first photograph, can you 
12 describe for the grand jurors where the photograph, 
13 what the photographer is seeing in that image? 
14 A This photograph right here would be, 
15 aga1n, if I move to this map at the intersection of 
16 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive, the 
17 photographer would have been taking a photo that 
18 would have been essentially almost due east. So 
19 taking a photograph due east. 
20 Q And so 1n that photograph, can you see 
21 Building Number 
22 A There would be Building Number and a 
23 portion of Building Number 
24 Q Can you put the laser pointer on Building 
25 Number 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 32 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A This would be Building Number right 
2 here. And then if we move to our left that would be 
3 Building Number 
4 
5 
Q 
of the 
Now, from this perspective, the location 
would, if they were, 
6 according to their statements, can you see where 
7 they would have been? 
8 A They discussed being near, essentially 
9 this area right here, the corner of this building 
10 somewhere in this area right here. (indicating) 
11 Q And there's a dumpster that you can see 1n 
12 that photograph; is that right? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q Okay. And then also there was a witness 
15 1n Building Number 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
And who was that? 
Q We can see Building Number 
first photograph? 
A Correct. 
from this 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q And then there were also possibly two 
23 witnesses that were near this dumpster? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And that would be? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 33 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q All right. 
and 
Is that the dumpster that 
3 appears in the top left-hand side of that first 
4 photograph? 
5 A Yes, ma'am. 
6 
7 
8 
Q Okay. Now, mov1ng onto, well, let me ask 
you this. Building 
and 
which would have been where 
would have been, can 
9 you see Building 1n this, 1n that first 
10 photograph? 
11 A Yes, it looks like you can see a portion 
12 
13 
of Building over here. 
Q Okay. So depending on the angle of that 
14 photograph and where they would have been, it's 
15 possible that someone from Building could see 
16 where the photographer was standing? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then the next photo, 1s this mov1ng 
19 clockwise or counter clockwise? 
20 A This next photo would be counter 
21 clockwise. 
22 Q Yeah, did I put these up wrong? 
23 A I think these two are transposed. 
24 Q Good thing I used removable tape, huh. 
25 All right. Tell you what, let's take a pause as we 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 34 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 try to get this right. 
2 (Recess) 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So we've discovered that 
4 I have some photographs in the wrong order and we're 
5 going to move on to the next board so that I can 
6 during maybe a break we can rearrange those 
7 photographs and put them up the way they should be 
8 and we will revisit that after a break. 
9 So the next board is going to be 
10 marked Grand Jury Exhibit 106. 
11 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 106 
12 marked for identification.) 
13 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Detective, looking at 
14 the photograph on the back of that board, can you 
15 tell me where the photographer is standing for these 
16 photographs? 
17 A This would be at the point where Michael 
18 Brown's body was located when we arrived at the 
19 scene. 
20 Q All right. Before we start, can you look 
21 at that real quickly and tell me did I get that 
22 right or is that wrong too? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS what happens when 
24 you do live theater. 
25 A The top is clockwise. This one 1s 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 35 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 clockwise. This 1s clockwise, we're good. 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Is this supposed to be 
3 there? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q All right, good. So looking at these 
6 photographs starting at the top left. And what 
7 direction is the photographer facing? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Primarily west. 
And that would be on Canfield Drive? 
That's correct. 
And from that first photograph, 1s she 
12 straddling the cone that appears in the photograph 
13 on the back of the exhibit? 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And so from this location, can you 
14 
15 
16 see the location where would have 
17 been? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
You can. 
And where 1s that? 
It would be at this point right here. 
And in the photograph you can see kind of 
22 the corner of a white house or structure? 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
Is that the house where he was? 
That is the house where he was working. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 36 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: I have a question about 
2 You mentioned, I guess, when we 
3 were here Thursday that you talked to the homeowner? 
4 A I talked to the individual who resides at 
5 that home and I also talked to the homeowner, yes. 
6 GRAND JUROR: And they said, what was 
7 their response to him being there? 
8 A Neither one could remember exact dates, 
9 but it was around that time they did both confirm 
10 that there was work being done on the home around 
11 that time and they both confirmed that there was an 
12 individual there. They didn't know names, there was 
13 an individual there that was doing some sort of 
14 drywall and painting work at the house. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I kind of find that a little 
16 strange because when he sat down with us, he told us 
17 that he specifically told whoever was at that house 
18 what had happened? 
19 A I asked her about that, and she said that 
20 she remembered talking to him briefly, didn't 
21 remember what they had talked about and that she 
22 ultimately left for work. 
23 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Let me ask you this, 
24 given that you actually have been to that residence, 
25 did you make any attempts for yourself to stand in 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 37 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the location where you believe stood 
2 and look down Canfield to see for yourself what 
3 someone in that position might be able to see? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And from where, from your observation, 
6 would a person standing at the location where 
7 said he was, could they see where the 
8 police vehicle was? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
They could. 
And could they see where the farthest 
11 easterly point where Michael Brown, witnesses say he 
12 may have stopped and turned around? 
13 A Yes, he could. 
14 Q Could you also see the place where Michael 
15 Brown's body came to rest? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Are there any obstructions between where 
18 from your observation from that vantage point to any 
19 of those locations is there any obstructions that 
20 would be in your way? 
21 A The only obstruction would have been the 
22 trunk of this tree right here. I don't know if 
23 everyone can see that. There is a tree right there 
24 and the trunk of that tree would have been the only 
25 obstruction. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 38 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: How big lS that trunk, how 
2 wide? 
3 A I don't know specifically, but clearly the 
4 only reason I mention that is in the interest of 
5 full disclosure, that's the only 
6 GRAND JUROR: According to your judgment, 
7 it 1s not a big, wide tree? 
8 
9 
10 
A 
A 
No, it 1s a grown 
GRAND JUROR: Full grown tree? 
It 1s clearly a grown tree, but 1n the 
11 grand scheme of looking at a particular incident, 
12 one tree that is at a distance, I didn't view it as 
13 something that would have impeded my ability to see 
14 the entire incident. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
GRAND JUROR: Thank you, Slr. 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: 
was standing, 
From his distance where he 
could he actually see 
19 the movements, you can see a person standing, but 
20 could you actually physically see the movements of 
21 Michael Brown? 
22 A So just by chance when myself and another 
23 detective were at this home right here, there was 
24 quite a few people walking around 1n this general 
25 area and up to and including someone walking what 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 39 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 would be roughly, aga1n, at the intersection of 
2 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Court. And you can 
3 clearly see that individual and I could clearly see 
4 that individual and I could see hands moving and I 
5 could see where they were moving their hands if 
6 walking like this, I would be able to see the 
7 movement of their hands, yes. (indicating) 
8 GRAND JUROR: Could see their facial 
9 expressions? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
A 
I don't remember. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
I don't remember. 
GRAND JUROR: All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
GRAND JUROR: How soon after the incident 
16 were these photos taken? 
17 A I don't, I could check for you and get you 
18 an exact date. 
19 
20 
21 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
But I don't remember. 
MS. ALIZADEH: The dates the photos were 
22 taking, is that what was asked? 
23 
24 
GRAND JUROR: Right uh-huh. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm guessing that might be, 
25 you know what, it might be the date they were

1 printed that's on the back, we'll find out. 
2 Do you have your report on your laptop? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
I do. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) He brought that so he 
5 could answer questions if there were questions like 
6 this. 
7 A So we were out there at roughly 8:30 a.m. 
8 and it would have been on Wednesday, October, yes 
9 October 1st. 
10 
11 
12 
A 
GRAND JUROR: The 1st? 
The 1st of October, yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: Could I make another 
13 comment? Conceivably the abundance of foliage 
14 during that course of time from August until October 
15 when the photos were taken, so there may not have 
16 been as much foliage? I know you are not a 
17 botanist, I understand that. 
18 A That was a consideration that we took, we 
19 took that into consideration in doing those photos. 
20 We wanted to get it, obviously, before the leaves 
21 started to change. If you look 1n these photos 
22 here. The foliage is still green. I'm not saying 
23 that, obviously, there are leaves in these photos 
24 right here, but the foliage is clearly green at that 
25 point when photos were taken.

1 
2 Q 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? Okay. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And then, Detective, 
3 also looking at this first image, if there were 
4 vehicles that were coming around this bend and 
5 proceeding eastbound on Canfield Drive, someone 
6 looking out of their front windshield would be able 
7 to see the police vehicle, correct? 
8 A Yes, ma'am. 
9 Q As well as the place where Michael Brown's 
10 body rested? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
13 vehicle? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
I believe so. 
And could they see the corner from their 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And so then in the second 
16 photograph, and this 1s turning clockwise, correct? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Moving clockwise, yes. 
So what building is this 1n the map? 
This building right here. (indicating) 
Yes. Is that the same as this building 
21 right here? You see a white SUV 1n front of these 
22 buildings, this is same building, right? 
23 
24 be 
25 
A 
Q 
So we're moving clockwise so this would 
Looking west?

Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
A Westbound, correct, you're asking about 
this building right here. (indicating) 
Q This building is the same as this 
4 building? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
What number would that be? 
That would be Building 
What witnesses were ln Building Number 
And in Building would have been 
Okay. And so if they were on the front of 
12 their building and looking toward the photographer, 
13 who is standing 1n this grouping, this is where 
14 Michael Brown's body was; is that correct? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
They would be able to see Michael Brown's 
17 body 1n the street? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And this building right here on the second 
20 photograph? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct, that would be Building 
Who is in that building? 
In Building 
and 
would have been 
would have resided in 
the building. It would have been moving from that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 43 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 building towards the, between her building and the 
2 dumpster. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
Q And then also somewhere in this area would 
have been where parked her car and 
walked over ln an easterly direction, correct? 
A That's correct. 
Q And lS 's apartment this 
one right here? (indicating) 
A It lS actually, would be on this side, so 
10 the western side of this stairwell right here, but 
11 this balcony right here is connected and there 1s 
12 obviously a balcony on this side that you cannot see 
13 that would be consistent with this one on the 
14 eastern end. 
15 Q We talked about the fact that there is, 
16 there's a balcony that's connected on the fronts of 
17 these buildings, but there's a wall that will at 
18 some point block somebody's vision depending upon 
19 where they are on their balconies and what they are 
20 looking at, is that fair to say? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
So depending on where somebody 1s on these 
23 balconies would depend on whether or not they could 
24 see something in the street? 
25 A Right. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 44 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
Q Okay. And so in the third 1mage now, 1 
2 aga1n, mov1ng clockwise, you see 
3 apartment? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Okay. And then were there any other 
6 people 1n Building Number ? 
Not in the building, no. 
's 
7 
8 
A 
Q Okay. And then on the fourth photograph, 
9 aga1n, moving clockwise, we can see this memorial 
10 here that's by a light pole. Is this close to the 
11 area where witnesses said he had stopped and turned 
12 around? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
It is. 
And from this photographer's vantage 
15 point, aga1n, you can see that dumpster in the 
16 background? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And you can see 
Right. 
's building? 
This Building Number , would this be this 
21 building back in the background? 
22 A That would be Building 
23 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Q 
Who was 1n Building ? 
Uh, and 
Okay. And then looking at the next 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 45 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 photograph, again, mov1ng clockwise then, now we are 
2 looking down Canfield Road and east down Canfield; 
3 1s that right? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q 
6 correct? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
And, again, you can see the place here, 
That's correct. 
And you can see 
Correct. 
's building? 
And what buildings are back here? 
That would be buildings, 1n terms of where 
12 witnesses were located, Buildings and then closer 
13 to that you can see a portion of Building and it 
14 looks like possibly a portion of Building 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
Number 
A 
Q 
And so what witnesses were 1n Building 
or near Building ? 
Building 
All right. 
would have been 
and 
In Building , we didn't have 
anybody from Building that said they were near or 
1n Building ; is that correct? 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then the sixth photograph in the 
24 group, aga1n, turning clockwise. What building 
25 number is this in the left-hand side in the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 46 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 background here? 
2 A I believe that is a portion of Building 
3 and then 1n the front here would be Building 
4 Q And then is this a different building 
5 right here? 
6 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
A 
Same, different address, same building. 
Okay. 
So it lS and , which are both 
9 part of Building 
10 
11 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Were there any witnesses 1n Building 
Yes. 
Who is that? 
or 
14 Q He said he was in like the first floor, 
15 which is basically slightly below street level, 
16 correct? 
? 
17 A Correct. As a frame of reference, I would 
18 say roughly about that high below street level. 
19 Q So if he were on his patio right outside 
20 his front door street level would be about three a 
21 and a half, 4 feet? 
22 A Roughly. 
23 Q And then clockwise, aga1n, looking at 
24 Photograph Number 7, I think? 
25 A We're looking at the same building, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 47 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 primarily Building there. 
2 Q All right. And then Number , or the next 
3 photograph? 
4 A Sure. Now this photo essentially is 
5 facing south. And we can see, again, a portion of 
6 Building and unrelated building off in the 
7 distance where we didn't identify any witnesses and 
8 then in the far right-hand side of the photograph we 
9 can see building, a portion of Building 
10 Q All right. Would this parking lot that we 
11 see here, I'm not sure on this, thinking from my 
12 vantage point, would that be where 
13 said that she parked her vehicle? 
14 
15 
16 
Yes. A 
Q Okay. And she indicates that she was 
standing in front of Building smoking a cigarette 
17 with some unidentified man? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Number 
Q 
Identified as building, not building, 
on the map here. 
Okay. And then 1s there another witness 
1n Building Number ? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And who 1s that? 
Or 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 48 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
I'm sorry, 
So , and he said he was 
3 inside the building and looked out his window and he 
4 saw some or all of this incident, correct? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so then in the next photograph, 
7 turning clockwise still, is that also Building 
8 
9 
10 
Number 
A 
Q 
? 
That's also Building , yes. 
And then the final photograph you come 
11 full circle again, now west down Canfield Drive; 1s 
12 that correct? 
13 
14 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any questions about this 
15 group1ng or witnesses? 
16

20 
21 
22 
A 
A 
GRAND JUROR: I didn't get the very first 
This one here? 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
This is Building which 1s right here. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Where was 
23 apartment here in Building 
24 A His apartment would have been, it 1s hard 
25 to see. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 49 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
So the second, yeah. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions about 
4 this group of photographs? 
5 And, of course, you can always ask later. 
6 At this time let's take a quick break while the 
7 detective and I redo the photographs and put them 1n 
8 the correct order and then we'll finish with that 
9 board and then we'll probably just go on to your 
10 questions about the investigation. 
11 (Recess) 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS Kathi Alizadeh and 
13 Sheila Whirley is present, we took a short break 
14 while the detective and I rearranged the photos in 
15 the top row. The rest of them, apparently, were 
16 right, but I had gotten the top row wrong. So let's 
17 start over with this board, which is 105. And 
18 again, based on the photograph that's on the back of 
19 the board, you can tell what perspective these 
20 photographs were from which is from where, 
21 Detective? 
22 A Again, this is from the eastern most point 
23 that witnesses had identified Michael Brown's 
24 traveling on Canfield Drive. So, aga1n, we are 
25 talking about the intersection of Coppercreek Court 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 50 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and Canfield Drive and the northwest, northern 
2 portion of the intersection right there. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. So the first 
4 photograph, again, all of these photographs are the 
5 photographer standing or straddling the cone that 
6 was placed there, and these cones that you placed 
7 for the photographer's benefit, were these based on 
8 measurements that you did that day? 
9 A They were based on measurements that were 
10 taken on August 9th and then measurements, again, 
11 that we did on the day that these photographs were 
12 taken, yes. 
13 
14 
Q And so you are talking about the 
measurements that were taken by Detective 
15 the day that he documented the crime scene? 
16 A Yes. 
on 
17 Q Okay. And so you used those measurements 
18 and then measured for yourself to determine exactly 
19 where the police car was, and exactly where the body 
20 was, and of course, the exact location of where 
21 Michael Brown stopped and turned around is just 
22 based upon various witness accounts; is that right? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And so for these photographs, this is the 
25 best of your information that this would have been 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 51 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the farthest east that he went before turning 
2 around? 
3 A The best information we had at that time, 
4 yes. 
5 Q Okay. Is there any change 1n that? You 
6 said at that time? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
No, no. 
Okay, all right. So in the first 
9 photograph, again, we're looking down Canfield 
10 Drive, correct? 
11 A That's correct. 
12 Q And the, in the background somewhat, maybe 
13 midrange 1n that photograph, you see the memorial 
14 where there is another cone and there's flowers and 
15 candles and stuffed animals, is that the location 
16 where Michael Brown's body was? 
17 A That cone has nothing to do with the cone 
18 that we placed. That cone was there when we arrived 
19 and that cone was left there, obviously, when we 
20 
21 
22 
left. We brought our own cone. 
the meaning of that cone. 
I would discount 
Q Okay. But that general location, so 
23 someone who was standing where the photographer 1s, 
24 you can get a feel of how far away Michael Brown's 
25 body came to rest in this first photograph, correct? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 52 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And then the second photograph 1s 
3 mov1ng clockwise? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And what building 1s that that we see? 
6 A Building right here. (indicating) 
7 Q And I think we talked about it, but let's 
8 recap, looking at the first photograph there, can 
9 you see the corner of that white house where 
10 says he was? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
You can. 
Okay. 
It is right there. (indicating) 
Now looking at the second photograph you 
15 said you see what building number is that? 
16 A And the second photograph that's Building 
17 
18 Q 
19 correct? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
And that would be where lives, 
That's correct. 
And I'm just going to really quickly go 
22 through these aga1n. Three, you are moving farther 
23 clockwise? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And you see the dumpster where the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 53

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
were close to, correct? 
Correct. 
And that would have been where 
and possibly were, correct? 
Correct. 
And then 1n the fourth photograph, aga1n, 
7 turning a little more clockwise. In the background, 
8 can you see what buildings? 
9 A That is Building right here. And then 
10 if we move to the left, we moved onto Building and 
11 this 1s a portion of Building right here. 
12 Q All right. And then the fifth photograph 
13 now you are looking east on Canfield Drive, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And again, you see a number of buildings 
16 1n the background there? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Those would be? 
Building 
I'm sorry. , which 1s on the north 
21 side of the street? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then what are the buildings on the 
24 south side of the street that are visible? 
25 A Building , Building , and that may be

a portion of Building right there. 
Q 
3 again? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
Put your laser pointer on Building 
Building 
And that was where the and 
were, correct? 
Right. 
8 Q And then turning a little clockwise. In 
9 the 6th photograph in the group. What building's 
10 visible there? 
A This right here would be Building , and 11 
12 this right here would be Building , a portion of 
13 Building 
14 Q 
15 lives? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Building 
And Building 1s where 
Right, yes. 
And then on Photograph Number ? 
We've moved onto it. This is entirely 
right here. 
20 Q And then building, I'm sorry, photograph 
21 the 8th photograph? 
22 A This is Building here aga1n, and now we 
23 see a portion of Building right here. 
24 Q And that parking lot that is seen between 
25 those two buildings, that is the parking lot where 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 55 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 says she parked her car; is that 
2 right? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
5 clockwise? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then in the 9th photograph, mov1ng 
6 A We are essentially see1ng that 1s all 
7 Building right there. 
8 Q And that would have been where 
was? 
Correct. 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q And then also in that image, let me see. 
12 We talked about seeing the mailboxes in one of these 
13 1mages. I hope it is in these. Pointing here, can 
14 you put your laser pointer right here. There 1s a 
15 black vehicle that appears to be parked there and 
16 then there's something behind the black vehicle. 
17 Would that be about where those mailboxes, those 
18 metal rows of mailboxes were? 
19 A It is. If you look at Photo 1 here, you 
20 can see the top, you will have to take my word for 
21 it, that's the top of the mailboxes right there. 
22 
23 
Q And that would be where 
she was near the mailboxes where she ended up. 
24 traveled from one point to another, correct? 
25 A Yes, ma'am. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 
said 
She 
56 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q Okay. And then finally in the lOth 
2 photograph, again, we have come 360. You are 
3 looking back down west on Canfield Drive, correct? 
4 
5 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody have any questions 
6 about this group of photographs? Did I confuse 
7 everybody by redoing them? Are you all okay with 
8 this? 
9 GRAND JUROR: I just have a quick question 
10 about the photographs that were taken from the 
11 vantage point of the officer's vehicle. Is this 
12 taken from like where his, the door of his vehicle 
13 was, you know what I'm saying, or was it like midway 
14 of the vehicle? 
15 
16 tire. 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
It was taken from the driver's side front 
GRAND JUROR: Driver's side front tire. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So where the cone was 
19 from that perspective, was from where the left front 
20 tire of Officer Wilson's vehicle was on the street? 
21 
22 
A Yes. 
GRAND JUROR: I just want to clarify for 
23 everybody and myself, the only cones we should pay 
24 attention to are the ones that are orange and white, 
25 the solid color orange someone else put there. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 57 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A The only cone that I would pay attention 
2 to is the cone that identifies in that first 
3 photograph where the detective would have been 
4 taking the photographs from. So I guess on the back 
5 here where we've identified is where we were 
6 actually taking the photographs from. 
7 So, yes, you are correct, these cones 
8 here, both of these cones here and this cone right 
9 here were obviously already there, we didn't place 
10 those there and those have no bearing in terms of 
11 the measurements that we took. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So when you would move 
13 from one location to the next to take pictures, 
14 would you remove the cone that you had previously 
15 placed? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So any cones that appear on the front of 
18 these boards are not cones that you have placed? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
All right. And then if you look on the 
21 back of those photographs, the cone that appears 1n 
22 those, on the back of the boards, the photograph 
23 that appears on the back of each board shows the 
24 cone where you placed it. Do show where the 
25 photographer was going to stand? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 58 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A Correct. Had I known there was go1ng to 
2 be cones out there already I probably would have 
3 taken something different for us to bring, but I 
4 didn't know that. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions about 
6 these photographs? 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Just briefly talk a 
8 little bit more about in this particular case the 
9 investigation and about the taking of witness 
10 statements. 
11 Virtually, not virtually, but almost 
12 all of the witness statements in this case that were 
13 taken were audio recorded, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And was there any reason for that, was 
16 there a decision why you were going to audio record 
17 certain statements or all of the statements? 
18 A By and large when we conduct homicide 
19 investigations, we record anybody with any pertinent 
20 information. And that's in this particular case or 
21 any other homicide investigation we are conducting. 
22 So it is essentially standard procedure for us to do 
23 that and so we did that in this particular instance 
24 too. 
25 Q And many of these recorded statements that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 59 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 we've heard that other officers have taken have been 
2 
3 
4 
5 
at libraries. 
he talked to 
Yes. 
Detective was at a library when 
, correct? 
A 
Q Different officers or detectives went to 
6 people's home to interview them. There was a 
7 witness interviewed at the NAACP headquarters and so 
8 would each detective have available to him a digital 
9 audio recorder to take with him if he were going to 
10 interview witnesses? 
11 A They are assigned by the departments their 
12 own recorders and we essentially carry those with us 
13 everywhere we go. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
Q I believe it was Detective and 
Detective who talked to , and 
, the I think 
it was that took the first statement from 
18 them that was audio recorded, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then Detective took another 
21 statement from them later, what was the reason for 
22 his second statement? 
23 
24 
25 
A The second statement was taken because we 
had received information that both and 
had shortly after the incident took 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 60 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 place written notes or written a document outlining 
2 what they had witnessed. And, obviously, that would 
3 be something that we would want to view if they 
4 would give us permission. So we went out and 
5 contacted them and asked for permission to view 
6 those items. 
7 Q So the fact that they both made written 
8 statements, they did not disclose that to you when 
9 you first, when Detective first talked to 
10 them, would that be correct? 
11 A That's correct. 
12 Q So there was a decision made once you 
13 found out about these written statements, somebody 
14 else needed to go out there, talk to them aga1n and 
15 try to get these statements from them, correct? 
16 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: How did you find out about 
19 the statements. 
20 A I believe it was their superv1sor had made 
21 reference to it when we were contacting him. So 
22 they were originally told by their superv1sor to 
23 write down their comments or write down their 
24 account of what they witnessed. So they did that 
25 and that was ultimately conveyed to us and so then 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 61 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 we went out and talked to and 
2 and asked that it was true, and they 
3 indicated it was and we obtained those. 
4 
5 
6 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, 
another interview conducted of 
after Detective 
7 them a second time? 
That's correct. 
there was yet aga1n 
and 
had talked to 
8 
9 
A 
Q What was the reason for the third 
10 interview? 
11 A During the course of the investigation, 
12 obviously, it 1s an evolving investigation and we've 
13 we're learned things on a daily basis. If I can go 
14 back in time to when we were contacting Dorian 
15 Johnson. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
And that would have been on the 13th? 
Yes, ma'am. So during the course of 
18 Dorian Johnson's interview, he talked about speaking 
19 with, he didn't mention them by name, 
20 and And during the interview with 
21 Dorian Johnson he made reference to 
22 
23 
24 
and talking with Michael Brown about 
marlJuana and about waxing. 
I had no idea what wax1ng was. We 
25 later learned that waxing delivers essentially a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 62 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 high concentration of THC to an individual in a very 
2 short period of time. So THC is the active 
3 ingredient in marlJuana. 
4 That didn't necessarily mean much to 
5 me until we learned from the autopsy report that 
6 Michael Brown had THC in his system and we learned 
7 that after speaking with Dr. from the St. Louis 
8 County Medical Examiner's Office, that his level was 
9 elevated to the point where it could have 
10 potentially caused a loss in perception of space and 
11 time and there was also the possibility that there 
12 could have been hallucinations. He couldn't say 
13 that for sure, but that is a potential effect of 
14 high levels of THC in an individual. 
15 So knowing that waxing delivers a 
16 high level of THC to an individual in a relatively 
17 short period of time and knowing that from Dorian 
18 Johnson, Michael Brown had had conversations with 
19 and about waxing, we 
20 thought it worth exploring the possibility that 
21 either gave, or 
22 provided, or sold wax to Michael Brown. And if that 
23 was the case, it could have potentially explained 
24 some of the behavior that we witnessed from Michael 
25 Brown on the audio, I'm sorry on the video at the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 63 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Ferguson Market and help explain some of the things 
2 taking place in this particular incident. 
3 Q All right. Now, had either 
4 or in their first two statements to 
5 County Police said anything about having discussions 
6 with Michael Brown about waxing? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
No. 
All right. Did you make a decision that 
9 you were going to attempt to reinterview both of 
10 those gentlemen? 
11 A We did. 
12 Q Now, on this occas1on though, you did not 
13 go out to their homes or their places of employment 
14 or a library, you actually brought them into the 
15 county police department and put them in an 
16 interview room where you often interview suspects, 
17 correct? 
18 A We contacted at his home and 
19 requested he accompany us back to our office and he 
20 agreed to do so. We contacted at a 
21 job site that he was working on and we did the same 
22 thing for him. We asked him to accompany us back to 
23 our office for an interview and they both 
24 voluntarily agreed to do so. 
25 Q So they were not under arrest? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 64 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
They were not. 
And when they were brought to your 
3 headquarters, did you bring them in during the same 
4 evening? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Did you interview them separately? 
Yes. 
And those interviews we seen were video 
9 and audio recorded; is that right? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q Prior to interviewing them you advised 
12 each one of them of their Miranda Rights? 
13 A We did, yes. 
14 Q And that wouldn't be something that you 
15 have done with other witnesses in this investigation 
16 g1v1ng them Miranda Rights, is that fair to say? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
And so why is it that you felt that you 
19 needed to advise these two of their Miranda Rights? 
20 A Miranda applies if there is an incident 
21 where there is custody and meaning individuals in 
22 custody, and there is a potential that we're going 
23 to ask guilt seeking questions. They were obviously 
24 not in custody, however, we were going to be asking 
25 them a series of questions and the purpose of the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 65 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 interview was to bring them 1n and ask them about 
2 this waxing. 
3 So we were go1ng to be asking them a 
4 ser1es of questions regarding waxing and the use of 
5 it and whether they had provided or sold or done 
6 anything to give Michael Brown and/or Dorian Johnson 
7 marlJuana or wax. 
8 And so based on that, I felt it was 
9 1n our best interest to error on the side of 
10 caution, be safe, there is nothing wrong with doing 
11 this and just Mirandize them just in the sense of we 
12 are going to be asking them guilt seeking questions. 
13 That could potentially impact future situations if 
14 they were to provide us information that could 
15 implicate them in a crime. 
16 Q All right. And so now when you brought 
17 each of those individuals 1n and began your 
18 questioning of them, you know, we've seen the 
19 videos, they both deny having anything to do with 
20 giving Michael Brown or Dorian Johnson any control 
21 substances, is that fair to say? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And they denied it from the beginning and 
24 yet you continue to question them for a substantial 
25 period of time; is that right? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 66 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q 
We did, yes. 
Now, this interview, how are these 
3 interviews different from the interviews that you 
4 have done with other witnesses because these two men 
5 were eyewitnesses or claim to have been eyewitnesses 
6 to a shooting? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Not suspects in the investigation, not 
9 even subjects in the investigation, but witnesses? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Why treat them differently than you did 
12 other witnesses 1n this case? 
13 A Well, if you've seen the video, you'll 
14 notice that we stayed away from discussing their 
15 accounts of the incident itself. And the incident I 
16 mean with Darren Wilson and with Michael Brown. 
17 Our motivation in speaking with them 
18 was purely to discuss the waxing aspect of it to see 
19 if there was anything that we were missing 1n this 
20 particular instance. 
21 So the reality 1s, when we speak to 
22 people, we're not always told the truth in terms of, 
23 right away 1n terms of what is going on. That's the 
24 reality of our job, sometimes people tell us the 
25 truth, but in other instances they do not. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 67 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 I mean, very few people are willing 
2 to come into an office and tell a deep dark secret 
3 or tell some sort of illegal activity that they've 
4 done after they have just met someone 1n a very 
5 brief period of time. 
6 So as such there are var1ous types of 
7 interviews that we can do. We can do it what I'm 
8 go1ng to call just a pure fact gathering interview 
9 where we sit down with somebody and we just document 
10 what they've told us. 
11 There are nonconfrontational 
12 interviews where we can generally discuss a topic 
13 with an individual in attempt to elicit information 
14 and there are what I would call a direct 
15 confrontation interview where we are directly 
16 confronting people and calling out those individuals 
17 on any inconsistencies or anything that we may 
18 believe that they may not be telling us the truth 
19 on. 
20 I don't have a hard and fast rule by 
21 1n large, I don't have a hard and fast rule how I 
22 conduct one interview. A lot of it is just based 
23 off of how a particular individual is reacting in an 
24 interview or how a particular interview is going, 
25 but ultimately we are looking for the truth and 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 68 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 sometimes it is hard to get that out of people 
2 initially. So we have to press them and we ask 
3 questions repeatedly and kind of like a salesman, we 
4 don't take no for an answer the first time. 
5 We, obviously, have an obligation to 
6 get to the truth to some extent and part of that 1s 
7 pressing people to see if they're really telling us 
8 the truth. 
9 Q But it is true, isn't it, Detective, that 
10 throughout your interview or interrogation of these 
11 two men, neither one of them ever admitted or said 
12 that they have been in any way involved in providing 
13 controlled narcotics to Michael Brown or Dorian 
14 Johnson; is that true? 
15 A Yes, that's correct. 
16 Q And your investigation has failed to find 
17 any information otherwise; is that true? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's true. 
And I think we discussed briefly and aga1n 
20 I'm go1ng to reiterate here, to your understanding, 
21 now you've completed your police report in this 
22 case; 1s that right? 
23 A I have. 
24 Q How many pages 1s your police report? 
25 A I don't know exactly, 1,100, 1,200 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 69 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 roughly. 
2 Q And so you've concluded your police 
3 report, but in reality does this investigation 
4 continue so long as there are witnesses who might 
5 come forward or want to be interviewed? 
6 A I would always add a supplement to the 
7 report that has been submitted if more people came 
8 forward, yes. 
9 Q And isn't it true, Detective, or let me 
10 ask you this, if at the conclusion of this grand 
11 jury investigation if there is information that 
12 comes to you regarding this investigation that is 1n 
13 any way relevant or pertinent to this investigation, 
14 would you bring that to my attention? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I will. 
And you're aware that there is no statute 
17 of limitations for murder or for class A felonies, 
18 correct? 
19 A I'm aware of that, yes. 
20 Q And that a prosecution against Officer 
21 Wilson could be brought at any time. In other 
22 words, even 50 years from today? 
23 
24 
25 this. 
A 
Q 
I'm aware of that, yes, ma'am. 
And if there would be, let me ask you 
You've reviewed a number of videos that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 70 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 people have recorded from var1ous devices, cell 
2 phones mainly, who claim to have recorded the 
3 shooting; is that right? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q Have you ever discussed a video that 
6 actually shows any part of the confrontation from 
7 the beginning where from the officer stopping to 
8 first confront or talk to those two boys all the way 
9 to the shooting itself? 
10 A I have not. 
11 Q Okay. Every video that you have seen 1n 
12 relation to this investigation, video of the 
13 aftermath of the shooting? 
14 A Every one, yes. 
15 Q Have you heard rumors that there's videos 
16 of the shooting out there? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
I have heard those rumors, yes. 
Have you done investigation to try to 
19 discover whether those rumors are true or track down 
20 people that have videos of the actual shooting 
21 itself? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, we have. 
And have those leads produced anything? 
No, they have not. 
And you're aware that even after this 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 71 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 investigation by the grand jury 1s concluded, we've 
2 discussed this, the possibility that there 1s for 
3 some reason somebody out there has a video that they 
4 have not come forward with, if that video were to be 
5 discovered by law enforcement, we could represent 
6 this to a grand jury; is that correct? 
7 
8 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: All have heard the term 
9 double jeopardy. Double jeopardy does not apply 
10 unless there is a trail jury that considers the 
11 facts. And so if a case starts, if there is a trial 
12 that starts with a trial Jury, that's when jeopardy 
13 attaches and someone can never be tried after that 
14 if there's a verdict or after that they can't be 
15 retried. 
16 Your decision, though, does not create 
17 jeopardy. In other words, there's no reason that 
18 there couldn't be additional investigation in the 
19 future or another consideration by probably not you 
20 all probably would be another grand jury if there 
21 would be something down the road, but in this case, 
22 Detective, you're aware still that the federal 
23 authorities have not concluded their investigation; 
24 1s that right? 
25 A That's correct. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 72 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) They're still looking 
2 for people? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Still trying to talk to people who have 
5 been unwilling to talk? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And if down the road those witnesses were 
8 to come forward with relevant information that may 
9 change the investigation, you would bring that to my 
10 attention wouldn't you? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
I would. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, you have questions? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Just a few. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Regarding the accuracy of 
15 these perspective photos, you don't walk it out with 
16 the witness that you gave information to test the 
17 accuracy of it? How do you come up with, you may 
18 have already told us, I thought you did, I want to 
19 understand how accurate the photos are. 
20 A Sure. In terms of on August 9th, one of 
21 our cr1me scene detective's jobs was to take various 
22 measurements of items of evidence at the scene. And 
23 he used what starts as a baseline at Coppercreek 
24 Court and Canfield Court, and used this baseline 
25 here and measured items during the entire, I should 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 73 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 say, within the entire cr1me scene and those items 
2 were documented in a diagram that he completed with 
3 specific measurements, feet down to inches. 
4 So when we went back out there to 
5 take those 360 degree panoramic shots, we based, 
6 obviously, Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive 1s 
7 subjective in the sense that we are basing that off 
8 of where, again, witnesses were telling us is the 
9 furthest point east that Michael Brown would have 
10 went. 
11 So that 1s a subjective point that we 
12 use that intersection, northwest corner of that 
13 intersection right there. 
14 However, the point where Michael 
15 Brown's body was located and the point where the 
16 vehicle was located, was measured on that day based 
17 off the measurements that were taken on August 9th. 
18 Q And when you take photographs showing 
19 where people live and what building that they would 
20 have, their vantage point was, that's based on 
21 statements that they gave you as to where they were 
22 located? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. So if you don't have that exactly 
25 right, then that's not going to be accurate? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 74 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A Correct, I am basing it only off of 
2 statements that they were able to provide to us, 
3 yes. 
4 Q Okay. And then you knew that swabs that 
5 were taken, evidence was gathered for DNA in this 
6 case? 
7 
8 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
The officer's belt, the officer's gun, 
9 some other items? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
You were part of that or your team decided 
12 what to se1ze as evidence? 
13 A For the most part, yes. 
14 Q Okay. And there's been testimony that 
15 Michael Brown was grabbed by the throat, was his 
16 throat swabbed for DNA sample? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Was Michael Brown's throat? 
Throat swabbed? 
I don't believe so. 
You may not have had that information when 
21 you gathered that information. Had you ever heard 
22 that before that he was grabbed, the officer grabbed 
23 him by the throat? 
24 A I had heard that and as I sit here today, 
25 I couldn't tell you what day I heard that. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 75 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q But you do know, no one collected a swab 
2 of his throat, his neck? 
3 A I don't believe his neck was swabbed, no. 
4 Q Okay. And if it was, you would know about 
5 that; is that right? 
A 6 I would have a report, yes. 
7 Q Okay. Now, you actually had an interview 
8 with the officer, Darren Wilson, on, was it the 
9 lOth? 
10 A Yes, ma'am. 
11 When you interviewed him? Q 
A 
13 And you allowed him to tell you whatever Q 
14 he wanted to tell you, right? 
15 A That's correct. 
16 Q You weren't stopping him from g1v1ng you 
17 information at any point; is that right? 
18 A I asked clarifying questions, but I did 
19 not stop him, no. 
20 Q You even asked him was there anything that 
21 he wanted to tell you that you hadn't asked? 
22 A I do that at the end of all interviews, 
23 yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And it was recorded? 
25 A It was, yes. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 76 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q And I believe when you asked him that his 
2 response was, I think we're good, does that sound 
3 right? 
That sounds right, yes. 4 
5 
A 
Q So he never told you that he chased down, 
6 chased after Michael Brown because, and continued to 
7 pursue him and eventually killed him because he was 
8 in fear that Michael Brown would attack other 
9 officers who were coming to the scene, did he ever 
10 tell you that? 
11 A He did not say that, no. 
12 
13 
14 time. 
Q Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That's all I have at this 
15 GRAND JUROR: I know that you and, I guess 
16 it was Detective and Detective 
17 Detective , I think he was responsible for 
18 collecting the duty belt; 1s that right. 
19 A Detective collected the duty belt. 
20 GRAND JUROR: Detective collected 
21 the duty belt? 
22 A Yes. 
23 GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
24 Darren Wilson, did he tell you he wanted to use his 
25 pepper spray at one time, but he didn't. He thought 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 77 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 about using it and then he thought aga1n because he 
2 didn't want it to come back in on him? 
3 A I don't remember the exact phrase that he 
4 used, but he made mention that he thought about 
5 us1ng his OC spray or his 
6 
7 A 
GRAND JUROR: Mace. 
Mace, as you said. But he also made 
8 mention that he realized he was in a confined space, 
9 mean1ng his vehicle and in a confined space, that 
10 obviously can affect other people, not just the 
11 intended target I think 1s what he was implying. 
12 GRAND JUROR: So we later found out from 
13 that mace or pepper spray 1s 
14 assigned to each patrolman and we got our report 
15 from, I guess , and no pepper spray was turned 
16 1n. Did you know about that? 
17 A No, I did not. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify this, okay. 
19 So, Detective, the duty belt, what's a duty belt? 
20 A A duty belt is essentially a belt that 
21 goes, obviously, on top of the pants and shirt that 
22 you always wear above a normal belt that contains 
23 the equipment that a police officer is going to wear 
24 during the course of his duty. 
25 So it has a place for his weapon, his 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 78 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 extra magazines, his baton if he carr1es one, his 
2 handcuffs, his radio holders, his mace, his taser, 
3 anything that would be deemed necessary for an 
4 officer to use in the course of his duties. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: And you are aware, aren't 
6 you, that on the night or the afternoon following 
7 the shooting, Detective , who is the one who 
8 went to the Ferguson Police Department and seized 
9 the gun, did not seize Officer Wilson's duty belt, 
10 correct? 
11 A I'm aware of that, yes. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: And did not inspect the 
13 duty belt or photograph the duty belt, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And was it sometime later 
16 1n the investigation that you contacted me and 
17 indicated that Darren Wilson's attorney asked us if 
18 we wanted the duty belt? 
19 
20 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And what date was that that 
21 Darren Wilson's attorney contacted you, asking if 
22 you wanted the duty belt? 
23 A I'll look it up here to be sure. Friday, 
24 September 12th. 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: So more than a month after 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 79 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the shooting, correct? 
2 
3 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And did the attorney tell 
4 you where the duty belt had been all this time. 
5 A He did. He indicated that the duty belt 
6 was placed in the trunk of Darren Wilson's personal 
7 vehicle when he left the Ferguson police station and 
8 that is where that duty belt remained until it was 
9 brought to our attention. And then from there he 
10 removed the belt from his vehicle and put it in a 
11 box and that box was then released to us. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So typically, Detective, lS 
13 a duty belt actually the personal property of the 
14 officer, is that something that they go out and get 
15 for themselves and it is their duty belt or did they 
16 trade duty belts with other officers. 
17 A I can't speak personally but for St. Louis 
18 County, St. Louis County provides those duty belts 
19 to each individual officer, but obviously property 
20 of St. Louis County. But in the sense of trading 
21 with other officers, no, there is no trading with 
22 other officers. Once that belt is assigned to a 
23 particular person, it is that particular person's 
24 belt. 
25 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So at the end of their 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 80 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 duty they would, they could take that belt home with 
2 them that had their gun, their handcuffs, magazines? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
5 with them? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Whatever 1s on the bet, that's goes home 
It does, yes. 
They don't leave it at the station for the 
8 next shift? 
9 A They do not. 
10 Q Okay. So now when you called me up and 
11 actually talked to me about having been contacted by 
12 Darren Wilson's attorney about the duty belt, we had 
13 a discussion about that; is that right? 
14 A We did. 
15 Q And we talked about whether or not we 
16 should se1ze that duty belt? 
17 A We did. 
18 Q And between you and I we decided it was a 
19 good idea to get it? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when the duty belt was seized, 
22 however, the officer's gun, of course, is not 1n it 
23 because that was seized by Detective 
24 correct? 
25 A That's correct. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 81 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q The other items that are contained in a 
2 duty belt, do you recall if those were in the duty 
3 belt? 
4 A I would have to look at the photos to know 
5 for sure. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I believe, have we 
7 seen photos of the duty belt, have you guys seen 
8 those? 
9 GRAND JUROR: We have a list of what was 
10 on it and what was fingerprinted. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me double check because 
12 I know I didn't call the witness who seized the duty 
13 belt. We have the duty belt as one of the items for 
14 you all to look at, but as far as whether there was 
15 anything in the duty belt, those photographs would 
16 show it. When we break for lunch before you begin 
17 deliberating, let me go back and check and give you 
18 those photos, okay. 
19 But at any rate, if there was things on 
20 the duty belt after the shooting, it is obviously 
21 conceivable that Darren Wilson, since he had 
22 possession of that duty belt from the day of the 
23 shooting until it was seized September 12th, could 
24 have removed things, could have changed things 
25 around and what have you, correct? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 82 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A That's possible. 
MS. ALIZADEH: We also discussed whether 
3 or not we would try to process the duty belt either 
4 for DNA or fingerprints, correct? 
5 A We did. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: And we discussed the fact 
7 that if you process for DNA, then you really kind of 
8 destroy the prints that might be on the item and 
9 v1ce versa, if you actually process for prints, then 
10 you might obliterate any DNA that might be on the 
11 item. 
12 So did we discuss and talk about having it 
13 processed for prints? 
14 
15 
A We did. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And you're aware that the 
16 duty belt was negative for Michael Brown's prints? 
17 
18 
A It was. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I've got the duty belt, so 
19 whatever is on it, if there was anything on it when 
20 it was seized that would still be on it, would that 
21 be fair to say? 
22 
23 yes. 
24 
A It would still be 1n the same condition, 
MS. ALIZADEH: And that would be police 
25 procedure when something is seized, you package it 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 83 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and document it 1n the condition that it was when 
2 you seized it and would have been photographed in 
3 that condition as well? 
4 
5 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I do have photographs. 
6 I haven't g1ven them to you, I'll go get them. 
If 
7 GRAND JUROR: Considering this is a crime 
8 that we are sitting here discussing, urn, wouldn't 
9 everything on Police Officer Wilson be considered 
10 evidence? My question is, why wouldn't his duty 
11 belt be detained the day of the shooting when 
12 pictures were taken of him before he went to the 
13 emergency room and of his uniform, why wouldn't 
14 everything be considered evidence that day because 
15 that 1s very important? 
16 A Obviously, I wasn't at the Ferguson police 
17 station when the items that were originally seized 
18 on August 9th were seized. I agree with you in that 
19 it's important. I wasn't made aware of the fact 
20 that it wasn't seized until obviously a later date 
21 and I can't answer that question because I wasn't 
22 there. 
23 GRAND JUROR: So how could you do an 
24 investigation if you haven't collected evidence? 
25 A Well, clearly we collected evidence. We 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 84 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 just did not seize that duty belt on that particular 
2 day mean1ng on August 9th. We did seize, obviously, 
3 his weapon and his clothing and those things, but we 
4 did not se1ze his duty belt. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me just ask, Detective, 
6 how long have you been a detective for St. Louis 
7 County? 
8 
9 
A Almost eight years. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And in your exper1ence, 
10 have you ever had cases where during the course of 
11 the investigation, other things are made known and 
12 then you wish you would have done something that you 
13 now no longer have the opportunity to do? 
14 A Absolutely. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Detective, I mean, 
16 Officer Wilson, was interviewed by at 
17 the hospital, correct? 
18 A Correct. 
19 Q And we know his duty belt wasn't seized 
20 that day? 
21 A That's correct. 
22 Q And it was the next day that you 
23 interviewed him at your headquarters, correct? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And I imagine was he in street clothes 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 85 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 about mentally doing a mental, I guess, inventory of 
9 the items on his duty belt during the time he says 
10 Michael Brown was assaulting him? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
He did make reference to that, yes. 
And yet you didn't make any decision at 
13 that time to seize the duty belt? 
14 A I think at that point I didn't know that 
15 it had not been seized. 
16 GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
17 Officer Darren Wilson on the lOth, what did he 
18 indicate to you as the reason why Michael Brown 1s 
19 leaving the car, why Officer Wilson exited his 
20 vehicle to begin pursuit what was his justification? 
21 I know what he told you us, I'd be interested in 
22 what he told you? 
23 A I think two separate questions there, am I 
24 correct? The first question is, would you repeat 
25 the first question? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 86 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: What did Darren Wilson 
2 explain was his reason for exiting his police 
3 vehicle and pursuing Michael Brown on foot? 
4 
5 
6 that? 
7 
8 
A 
A 
To arrest him. 
GRAND JUROR: That's what he told you on 
Yes, s1r. 
GRAND JUROR: I know we've heard evidence 
9 that Michael Brown after he turned around and 
10 advanced back towards Officer Wilson, and we have 
11 our diagram of the crime scene with the measurements 
12 on it and I just want to make sure I'm interpreting 
13 all of this right. So as far as physical evidence, 
14 we have the blood on the ground that was about 21 or 
15 22 feet from where Michael Brown ended up. So we 
16 know for a fact that's a m1n1mum distance he might 
17 have advanced and from eyewitness testimony that 
18 placed him at the corner of Coppercreek, that 
19 dimension looks like it is closer to 48 to 50 feet; 
20 1s that correct? So that would be like an outer 
21 A I'm going to look at this diagram also 
22 just so I'm sure we are on the same page here. 
23 So you're saying, obviously, this 
24 would be zero right here, right. 
25 GRAND JUROR: The distance was 48 feet 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 87 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 2 inches according to this diagram. 
2 
3 
A Correct, yes, s1r. So we would say, and 
you made reference to the blood on the ground. So 
4 from this point here, the red stains in the roadway 
5 are identified what was later determined to be 
6 Michael Brown's blood as Items 19 and 20 on the key 
7 for the diagram. So Items 19 and 20, so the zero 1s 
8 here, identified as being 31 feet and 26 feet 
9 7 inches, and this direction here, and then you're 
10 correct in saying if we continue to move west on 
11 Canfield Drive, Michael Brown's left foot and right 
12 foot for that matter are, 48 feet 2 inches, yes, 
13 s1r. 
14 GRAND JUROR: If I did the calculation 
15 that was 21 and a half feet? 
16 
17 
A Yes, sir. 
GRAND JUROR: Physical evidence, 
18 eyewitness reports would have doubled that. 
19 A 21, 22 feet between the blood and where 
20 Michael Brown's body was when we arrived, yes. 
21 GRAND JUROR: Okay. And a second 
22 question. We heard the audiotape that had the last 
23 ten shots on it, can you tell us exactly what that 
24 timeframe was from the first shot to the tenth shot 
25 there? We tried to approximate it, it was s1x or 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 88 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 seven seconds, but do you know exactly? 
2 A I know that that audio was sent to someone 
3 at the FBI in Quantico who does testing relating to 
4 audio and things of that nature. I don't have that 
5 report in front of me and I wouldn't be comfortable 
6 in saying what those, what that analyst identified. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I do have the report. I 
8 can g1ve it to you. He did not time, there is 
9 nothing about the duration of the shots. The report 
10 just indicates that there were ten, what appeared to 
11 be ten apparent gunshots and a male voice speaking. 
12 It was just an analyst of the audio and it doesn't 
13 really say, it says nothing about duration of the 
14 shots. 
15 So I'd be happy to get that report for 
16 you. 
17 GRAND JUROR: There wasn't a craft line 
18 that showed time of duration? 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: No, that wasn't done. 
20 A Yes, sir. 
21 GRAND JUROR: In your professional 
22 op1n1on, I'm not a blood splatter analyst, but say 
23 Michael Brown 1s standing around the area where we 
24 know his body fell and he's shot in the head, could 
25 where the blood landed potentially have been, I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 89 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 don't know some trajectory or we to expect or 
2 understand that, I don't know what my question 1s. 
3 If he was traveling from the baseline you 
4 marked as zero the corner of Coppercreek and 
5 Canfield that would somehow trail, is there a way to 
6 know? 
7 A I'm not a blood spatter analyst either, 
8 but I think 22 feet would be an extremely 
9 unrealistic expectation that blood is going to 
10 travel that far. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Did you have occas1on 
talk to ? 
A I did. 
to 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 GRAND JUROR: We heard of some testimony 
16 about, but we haven't heard directly, can you g1ve 
17 us a quick synopsis of what he said happened? 
A I guess, let me clarify first. When you 18 
19 are talking about you are making 
20 reference 
21 GRAND JUROR: To the person in the video 
22 that we have seen, because what I'm trying to 
23 determine is, you know, what was his demeanor 1n the 
24 store in person versus what we are seeing on a 
25 screen. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 90 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A The and the individual 1n the 
2 video, obviously, we may have discussed this last 
3 week does not speak English. So when we talk to 
4 him, we talk to him with an interpreter. 
5 
6 A 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
And through the interpreter he indicated 
7 that you're saying demeanor, meaning Michael Brown's 
8 demeanor? 
9 
10 A 
GRAND JUROR: Yes. 
He said Michael Brown walked 1n and was 
11 us1ng curse words. He couldn't recall what those 
12 curse words were. There was some degree of a 
13 language barrier there and he collaborated 
14 essentially what you saw 1n the video. 
15 I showed him the video during the 
16 course of the interview that I conducted with him, I 
17 showed him the video and he corroborated that 1s 
18 obviously what took place from his perspective, but 
19 in terms of actual language, he knew that there were 
20 curse words he said, but the language barrier 
21 prevented him from explaining any further what he 
22 was say1ng. 
23 
24 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
25 Darren Wilson, his interaction with Michael Brown, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 91 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 that he thought Michael Brown had a weapon of any 
2 kind? 
3 
4 
A No. 
GRAND JUROR: He didn't indicate or no, he 
5 didn't have a weapon? He didn't mention it at all 
6 or he said yes, I know he didn't. 
7 A I would want to check the transcript for 
8 an exact account, however, at the point that I, 
9 remember, at the point that I interviewed Darren 
10 Wilson, there had already been one cursory interview 
11 completed with him or a safety statement completed 
12 with him. And in that safety statement and in that 
13 cursory interview, obviously, he made no mention of 
14 a weapon. So to some degree it was implied that 
15 there was no weapon involved 1n this on Michael 
16 Brown's part. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Detective , do you 
18 recall, and his statement will speak for itself and 
19 you have a transcript of his statement, but do you 
20 recall in his statement to you him saying that he 
21 saw Michael Brown's hand go into his waistband? 
22 
23 
A He did say that, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: But he never said that he 
24 saw a weapon? 
25 A Correct. Just 1n terms of see1ng a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 92 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 weapon, no, he never indicated that he saw one. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Did he ever tell you that 
3 he thought Michael Brown was going for a weapon? 
4 A In the sense of when Darren Wilson is 
5 making reference to Michael Brown putting his right 
6 hand, he described it as he put his right hand in 
7 his waistband and then started coming towards Darren 
8 Wilson. That would have been an instance where it 
9 could have been implied that, yes, there was a 
10 weapon there. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: He never said that, the 
12 interview will speak for itself, I want y'all to 
13 review it if you need to. 
14 But he never said to you, I thought he was 
15 go1ng for a weapon so I had so shoot him, or do you 
16 recall? 
17 A I'm go1ng to check my report. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I'm going from my 
19 memory as well, I don't have copy of the transcript 
20 1n front of me. 
21 A So 1n the transcript here he makes 
22 reference to during his first stride, he took his 
23 right hand, put it under his shirt and put it in his 
24 waistband. And then as he continues, he again makes 
25 reference to still charging, and again, I'm reading 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 93 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the transcript here, still charging, hand still 1n 
2 his waistband, hasn't slowed down. And then he 
3 again makes reference to the same thing, still 
4 running at me, hadn't slowed down, hands still 1n 
5 his waistband. 
6 So he makes reference to it three 
7 times there and then one final time when he says, 
8 when he went down, his hand was still under his 
9 right hand, was still under his body, looks like it 
10 was still in his waistband. 
11 So in that sense does he ever 
12 specifically say the word weapon? No. In that 
13 conversation that I'm having with him, me, as a 
14 police officer knowing that if an individual has his 
15 hand in his waistband, that 1s of concern to me 
16 personally. 
17 And so it was implied, 1n my op1n1on, 
18 that he was making reference, that Darren Wilson was 
19 making reference to believing that there could have 
20 been a weapon 1n Michael Brown's waistband, however, 
21 as you said, he never specifically mentioned the 
22 word weapon. 
23 GRAND JUROR: On that same note, we know 
24 that Michael Brown's hand was, had the severe lnJury 
25 with blood, so you would be able to look at the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 94 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 shirt and shorts to be able to see if there was 
2 blood in that specific area, correct? I don't know 
3 if you can to verify, did you verify that? His 
4 comment that he saw him at his waistband or shorts 
5 or shirt, did you look to see on Michael Brown's 
6 actual shirt or shorts if there is blood in that 
7 area? 
8 A There 1s both his shirt and his shorts are 
9 very bloody so. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: It may be difficult to tell 
11 whether it was from that or from the body laying in 
12 the street and so forth. 
13 GRAND JUROR: When you interviewed Darren 
14 Wilson, did he at any time tell you how many times 
15 he thought he shot his weapon? 
16 A He didn't recall. And realistically in my 
17 experience that is a normal acceptable answer to 
18 hear from a police officer who has been involved 1n 
19 a critical incident. Very often police officers 
20 either don't know, or get the number of shots 
21 incorrect. And I don't see that as being something 
22 that frequently occurs. 
23 
24 
25 
Detective 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Did he mention it to 
1n the preliminary. 
In terms of how many shots? You would 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 95 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 have to ask Detective that. 
2 GRAND JUROR: For some reason I got he 
3 said he shot four times, four shots. 
4 A 
5 shots. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
A 
A 
I'm making reference to in terms of total 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
Are you making reference to something? 
GRAND JUROR: Total shots, yeah. 
No. I mean, clearly, I think he probably 
10 could deduce that when he went back to the station 
11 that his weapon carries 12 rounds in the magaz1ne 
12 plus one in the chamber. And, you know, he can, 
13 obviously, I don't know that he did, count how many 
14 rounds he had left. But he didn't make reference 
15 to, he didn't know when I asked him. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: If you are looking for 
17 where that might come from, keep 1n mind that I had 
18 Sergeant testify about what he first told him, 
19 so you can review Sergeant 's testimony. We had 
20 testify about his cursory interview at 
21 the hospital, so you can review that. Neither one 
22 of those were recorded interviews keep in mind. And 
23 then there was the recorded interview with Detective 
24 , which you have that transcript. 
25 And then finally, Special Agent 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 96 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 testified that she interviewed him, but her 
2 interview was not recorded as well. So you wouldn't 
3 maybe, you could look back at the transcript of her 
4 testimony and then also keep in mind that Darren 
5 Wilson testified before this grand jury and you 
6 could review his testimony to see if there's mention 
7 of how many shots. 
8 
9 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: What is the policy and 
10 procedure of when a police officer goes to the 
11 hospital to be examined as far as who is present 1n 
12 the room with the patient and the doctor? 
13 A Well, I don't know that I can answer that 
14 question. Obviously, Ferguson Police Department may 
15 have their own policy in terms of how they handle a 
16 situation like that. I would say with St. Louis 
17 County, obviously, you would have the patient and I 
18 would assume that you would probably have a 
19 superv1sor there who is there to provide support to 
20 an injured officer. I'm just talking in general 
21 terms here, provide support to an injured officer. 
22 And you may have another police officer there aga1n 
23 to provide support or something needs to take place, 
24 but I can't specifically answer for Ferguson Police 
25 Department. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 97 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: And they would be present in 
2 the examine room? 
3 
4 
5 
A 
A 
During any kind of exam1ne taking place? 
GRAND JUROR: (Nods head. ) 
My guess would be that would be up to each 
6 individual officer whether they were comfortable 
7 with a co-worker or a supervisor being present. 
8 Obviously, if they weren't 
9 comfortable, I'm sure a supervisor or co-worker 
10 would leave, but if they are comfortable, I'm sure 
11 they could stay too. 
12 GRAND JUROR: And when the doctor is 
13 exam1n1ng the patient, would there be a reason for 
14 the supervisor to be answering questions? 
15 A I guess it would probably depend on what 
16 type of questions they would be answering. 
17 
18 A 
GRAND JUROR: But they're not the patient? 
There is obviously an aspect to some sort 
19 of workman's camp or payment 1ssues or any number of 
20 things like that could arise that a superv1sor may 
21 take upon his, may take responsibility for. But 
22 specifically in any specific situation, I don't 
23 know. I think it would be entirely different. 
24 Obviously, just as if any of us got 
25 hurt 1n a work place environment, I'm sure a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 98 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 supervisor and/or co-worker would be there to assist 
2 1n whatever way they could through the process. 
3 GRAND JUROR: I have one question, I have 
4 a couple of questions, one in particular is about 
5 his visit to the emergency room. It says in his 
6 triage report that the patient presented with St. 
7 Louis County Police to the emergency room for 
8 evaluation from home. 
9 And when we had somebody testify here, I 
10 just want, do you know if he went home first? 
11 A He did not go home. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
A He went to the Ferguson Police Department 
at the direction of Sergeant and he waited 
there until Detective 
obviously, Detective 
arrived. And, 
drove, not with, but 
17 followed Darren Wilson and I believe Colonel 
18 from the Ferguson police station to the 
19 emergency room. 
20 GRAND JUROR: Do you know where Darren 
21 Wilson lives, or what street, or what I'm trying to 
22 determine is how far away he lives from the 
23 hospital? 
24 
25 
A He lives quite a ways away. 
GRAND JUROR: I just want to make sure I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 99 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 understand what you were trying to say earlier, I 
2 know everybody has asked some questions about some 
3 of the things he told us here versus some of the 
4 things he told you about. 
5 A Sure. 
6 GRAND JUROR: I want to make sure I'm 
7 understanding what you are say1ng because with my 
8 work I'll talk a certain way with my co-workers then 
9 I would with this guy right here. So I'm assuming 
10 that it is acceptable for things to be inferred, I'm 
11 a little nervous, it is acceptable to go unspoken 
12 that you know could have happened, that he would 
13 have to explain to us. 
14 
15 
16 
A Can you give me a specific example of what 
you are making reference to? 
GRAND JUROR: Several things. I can't 
17 remember what Sheila asked, but she asked a question 
18 and then he asked a question about did he say he was 
19 unarmed. He said, well, several times that his hand 
20 was still 1n his waistband and I can see where some 
21 people would say that he was holding an lnJury or 
22 something, but as a police officer, and as a fellow 
23 police officer, you don't know that's what he was 
24 doing, you think he could be, so you're taking as a 
25 police officer that doesn't have to be explained to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 100 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you. 
2 A Correct, I think just like it is in any 
3 industry or any line of work, I think there are 
4 obviously things that don't necessarily need to be 
5 explained or as you said, implied in any industry. 
6 And you make reference to the hand in 
7 the waistband. A hand in the waistband to me in a 
8 situation is an alarm in any given situation because 
9 I don't know as a police officer, I'm talking 1n 
10 general terms here now, I don't know is that 
11 person's hand cold or is it that they're going to 
12 pull out a knife or a gun or baton or whatever. 
13 GRAND JUROR: So it is possible that the 
14 difference is in things that he told you and the way 
15 he explained things how he told us could simply be 
16 you are a police officer and you know the situation, 
17 you know the type. 
18 A I think that's possible, yes. 
19 Specifically in the situation with the hand 1n the 
20 waist, I believe I knew what he was making reference 
21 to when he's talking about he makes mention to it 
22 four times, you know. 
23 
24 A 
GRAND JUROR: It 1s a concern? 
It was obviously a concern to him and to 
25 me as a police officer, it would be a concern to me 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 101 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 also. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask. I'm sure your 
3 lunch 1s here. If you want to follow-up with him 
4 after lunch, we can do that or you think there's 
5 another five minutes worth of questions we can try 
6 to finish with him. He's sticking around. 
7 If for some reason during lunch you want 
8 to ask him something else, you know, we'll bring him 
9 back. But I know your lunch is probably here. Is 
10 there anything press1ng right now that you want to 
11 ask him before break? 
12 GRAND JUROR: When you spoke with or 
13 interviewed Officer Darren Wilson, at that time was 
14 he represented by an attorney? 
15 
16 
A He was, yes. 
GRAND JUROR: At any time did his attorney 
17 say that there's certain things that you cannot ask 
18 him? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
A 
He did not, no. 
GRAND JUROR: He did not. 
No. As a matter of fact, I think during 
22 the course of the interview his attorney maybe said 
23 two words. 
24 GRAND JUROR: So he was present there with 
25 Darren Wilson? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 102 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
A Yes, ma'am, yes. He was present in the 
conference room when we interviewed him. So it was 
myself, Detective , Darren Wilson, and Darren 
4 Wilson's attorney 1n the conference room. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Correct me if I'm wrong, I 
6 believe we've heard that his attorney was also 
7 present with him at the hospital? 
8 
9 
A He was, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Had actually ridden from 
10 the Ferguson Police Department with Colonel 
11 1n the car with Darren Wilson, correct? 
12 A I don't remember specifically if he was 1n 
13 the car, but he definitely was at the Ferguson 
14 Police Department and he definitely was at Christian 
15 Northwest Hospital with Darren Wilson, yes. 
16 GRAND JUROR: A public citizen or police 
17 officer walking down to the park, they're sitting 1n 
18 a car and they are strangled and beaten to death, 
19 that's a homicide and there is no weapon involved; 
20 1s that correct? Are physical hands ever a weapon 
21 or you beat me to death? 
22 A Is it a homicide? Yes. A homicide is 
23 simply a manner of death, but more specifically a 
24 homicide is a death at the hands of another person 
25 so yes, it would be a homicide. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 103 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
A 
GRAND JUROR: And hands would be a weapon? 
Could be absolutely, yes. 
GRAND JUROR: So I'm getting to the point 
4 this officer felt he was in danger of being beaten 
5 to death sitting in his car, you could almost say 
6 there was a weapon involved at that point, that's 
7 where I'm confused a little bit. I understand no 
8 weapon 1n the form of a pistol or handgun, if you 
9 are 1n danger, that your life was in danger that you 
10 are being beaten to death, is there a weapon there 
11 or not? 
12 A Well, there's a weapon 1n the sense there 
13 1s something in a hand? 
14 
15 
16 yes. 
17 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Right. 
No. Can you use your hands a weapons, 
GRAND JUROR: Right. There lS no 
18 requirement to see a physical weapon, gun, knife, 
19 for a police officer or citizen to defend themself, 
20 or 1n the case of a police officer to use deadly 
21 force. You don't need to see a handgun to defend 
22 yourself with deadly force if you are police 
23 officer, you assume your life is in danger by means 
24 other than a physical weapon? 
25 A If a police officer 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 104 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me stop you here. 
2 We're going to give you prior to your deliberations 
3 what the law states when a law enforcement officer 
4 can use force, when a person defending themselves 
5 can use force, and when they can use deadly force. 
6 And so, you know, this would be maybe his 
7 understanding of the law, but we have taken great 
8 pains to make sure we are go1ng to get you the law 
9 so that I don't want anybody to misinterpret it. 
10 I'm just going to stop you there and we'll give it 
11 to you before your deliberations okay? 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
So 
12 
13 GRAND JUROR: Kind of a follow-up on what 
14 he's say1ng. 
15 Due to Michael Brown's s1ze and demeanor, 
16 could Darren Wilson have considered him as a person 
17 as being a weapon? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: You know, these are all 
19 things there are, 1s the definition of deadly weapon 
20 including 1n there? 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: We can put it 1n there, 
22 deadly force is in there. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Here lS the thing. You all 
24 know from being a grand jury for several months, 
25 that there's, you know, for example, with armed 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 105 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 criminal action, you know, you have to have 
2 committed a crime by, with, through the use of a 
3 dangerous instrument, a deadly weapon and there are 
4 definitely definitions as to what is a deadly weapon 
5 and a dangerous instrument. 
6 I believe once you see the law that we've 
7 written, it talks about what a person, their 
8 reasonable belief 1s. And so those things that you 
9 are asking is, could a person reasonably believe 
10 that their life was threatened, that's the crux of 
11 what you all have to talk about. And again, it 1s 
12 necessarily appropriate for him to answer those 
13 questions, whether or not Darren Wilson could have 
14 reasonably felt that he was, his life was 1n danger 
15 1s something you all have to decide. And be guided 
16 by what the evidence is and then what the law is 
17 that Sheila and I have put together based on the 
18 statutes and criminal instructions and jury trials, 
19 okay. 
20 I don't want you to, I don't think it is 
21 appropriate for him to interpret the law. That's 
22 going to be your job and if you have questions about 
23 the law, because under the grand jury rules, we are 
24 your legal advisers. So if there are questions 
25 about the law as you are deliberating, you ask us 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 106 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 those questions because we are your legal advisers. 
2 GRAND JUROR: Without relation to the law, 
3 have you 1n your dealings as a police officer, ever 
4 seen anyone knocked out by one punched? 
5 A Have I personally seen it? No. Have I 
6 responded to calls where someone has been knocked 
7 out with one punch by a neighbor, a person at a bar? 
8 Yes. 
9 GRAND JUROR: Everything that they are 
10 talking about, I just want to get back to the basics 
11 of what happened or see what happened. Necessarily 
12 walking 1n the middle of the street is not that big 
13 of a deal, but when it got to the point, I've heard 
14 it described as a tussle, a struggle and everything 
15 like that, so when a citizen and a police officer 
16 are 1n a tussle, that's a crime by the person 
17 tussling with the police officer? 
18 
19 there. 
20 
21 
22 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm going to stop you 
GRAND JUROR: Why? 
MS. WHIRLEY: We have a rule on that too. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Because there are 1ssues 
23 about who was the initial aggressor, whether or not 
24 the officer was making a lawful arrest, those are 
25 all things that the law will tell you. You can 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 107 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 consider whether you believe the officer's actions 
2 were lawful, and those are things that once you read 
3 the law. 
4 GRAND JUROR: So you are go1ng to g1ve us 
5 those guidelines for us? 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Right. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: We're not go1ng to g1ve you 
8 the facts and say if he did this and then this, if 
9 you believe this, then this. But we're going to 
10 give you what the law says when a law officer can 
11 use force to affect an arrest and when that force 
12 can be deadly. And then also when a person can use 
13 force to defend themselves and when that force can 
14 be deadly. 
15 There 1s all kind of things about whether 
16 or not the person is an initial aggressor, you know. 
17 And under the law, a law enforcement officer can be 
18 an initial aggressor, unless his arrest is unlawful. 
19 So there is all kind of things that go into that 
20 that I don't think he can answer those questions. 
21 GRAND JUROR: As long as we are going to 
22 get those guidelines. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: You will get definitions 
24 also and you apply the facts as you know them to the 
25 law. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 108 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: Just in case you don't come 
2 back, I need this for me. When starting your 
3 investigation after you already interviewed Officer 
4 Wilson, okay. You heard A of the story, there's A 
5 and B, but B is deceased. 
6 
7 
A Correct. 
GRAND JUROR: My question is, you heard 
8 his testimony, starting your investigation, you have 
9 A in your mind and then you go interview all of the 
10 other witnesses. When B doesn't have a voice, you 
11 don't make that your main concern during your 
12 investigation, I'm asking you as a police officer or 
13 a detective. 
14 
15 
A Okay. What's the question? 
GRAND JUROR: So the question 1s, Officer 
16 Wilson's testimony told you his scenario what 
17 happened. Of course Mike Brown cannot speak. 
18 A Right. 
19 GRAND JUROR: You only have what part A 
20 said, you don't have part B. So going off what he 
21 said and you are starting your investigation, that's 
22 your focus point, so do you like try to put 
23 everybody's investigation towards part A or you 
24 trying to put this scenario together? 
25 A Absolutely not. Do I try to put 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 109 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 everyone's toward part A as you made reference? In 
2 the initial phases of an investigation, it's simply 
3 to, I'm summarizing it here. 
4 
5 A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
It is simply to find as many witnesses as 
6 we can and gather the facts. There is no skewing to 
7 one side or to the other. It's essentially locate 
8 witnesses, obtain their statements from them, and it 
9 is to gather the evidence at the scene. 
10 And then in this particular instance, 
11 right, I present it to you, ladies and gentlemen of 
12 the grand jury, and you can make the decisions from 
13 there. But there is no skewing one side either way, 
14 okay. 
15 
16 
GRAND JUROR: 
GRAND JUROR: 
Thank you. 
One last question. In your 
17 eight years as a detective, have you ever had to 
18 arrest a police officer? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
A 
I have, yes, several times. 
GRAND JUROR: Can you g1ve one example? 
I've, well, this year I arrested a St. 
22 Louis County police officer for an assault. 
23 Several years ago I arrested a city 
24 police officer for an assault. I've conducted other 
25 investigations into police officers where they have 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 110 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 been arrested for a sex cr1me. Those are the three 
2 that are popp1ng up right now. I'm confident there 
3 are a few others one. 
4 
5 
6 
or they 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Assault, domestic assaults 
One was an on duty assault that took place 
7 at a MetroLink station and the incident was captured 
8 on video. The other one was an assault that took 
9 place, the officer was in uniform and he was at his 
10 station, he was getting off duty or had just gotten 
11 off duty and he assaulted several individuals and so 
12 obviously, both of those individuals I arrested. 
13 
14 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
And really, he won't be going far. If 
15 after lunch you think of something else you need to 
16 ask him to call him back, we're not going to start 
17 deliberations right now. So we'll conclude for 
18 lunch at this time. 
19 (Lunch recess taken) 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley, it 
21 1s November 21st, I'm not sure of the time, it is 
22 after 1:14 or so. I did reach regarding 
23 his report and he advised me that his report would 
24 be more complete and detailed, and that he could 
25 have it to us by noon on Monday. I asked him what 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 111 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 would be different, you know, or significant, and he 
2 said that he would be able, he can derive from the 
3 photos that he viewed once he was here the bullet 
4 trajectory and the position that the body was in 
5 when it was shot. 
6 When he was here, he basically answered 
7 our questions, but a report, when he would sit down 
8 and write a report it would be more comprehensive 
9 and detailed. 
10 He said he didn't realize, he hadn't 
11 started working on it, he didn't realize he could 
12 submit one after his testimony, but he could work on 
13 it and have it ready by Monday noon, before noon. 
14 With that 1n mind, I know you didn't g1ve us your 
15 answer as to what you had decided about the report, 
16 what do you think, do you want the report? 
17 
18 
MS. ALIZADEH: Tell them the other option. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I thought we would go to the 
19 other option if they don't want the report. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: They should know all of 
21 their options. 
22 GRAND JUROR: If I'm hearing you right, 1n 
23 his report is he saying that based on the trajectory 
24 of the bullets he is going to show a diagram of 
25 positioning of the body that resulted in those 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 112 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 injuries? 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: I didn't go into detail 
3 questioning of him, and that's where the other 
4 option comes in and we will talk about that in a 
5 minute, but what he said basically is his report 
6 will talk about the trajectory of the bullets and 
7 what position the body was in when it was shot based 
8 on his findings. 
9 Now, the other option 1s, as Kathi was 
10 suggesting, I could find out if you want to ask him 
11 a question, like you had a pretty detailed question 
12 right then, I could try and reach him again and see 
13 if he 1s available, maybe we could do a conference 
14 call and you can ask him some questions about what 
15 his report would say that he didn't talk about here 
16 or how it may differ or how it is more complete. 
17 Was there another option? I think those were the 
18 two options. Am I missing one? 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: The options are continue 
20 without the report or without a conference call. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: That's the third option. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: Or let's just wait for the 
23 report on Monday at noon, or let's get him on a 
24 conference call and see if he can explain to us what 
25 might be in his report that he didn't testify to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 113 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 when he was here, or we need to have him back live 
2 and in person for you all to question him in person. 
3 I'm not suggesting any of these. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, it lS up to you. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: These are all your 
6 decisions. Sheila is the one who talked to him 
7 that's why I told her, tell him what you said. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: That's what he basically 
9 said. 
10 GRAND JUROR: He said that he could tell, 
11 hit report is going to be tell us what position the 
12 body was in when he was shot. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: He's going to be g1v1ng an 
14 op1n1on 1s my understanding is, he wasn't there. 
15 A That's different than what he said when he 
16 was here, so if that's the case, then I think we 
17 
18 
need to wait until we have the report. 
GRAND JUROR: What he said, 1s a 
19 pr1ma dona. How much time he need to do a report, a 
20 final report. Every time he says something, he 
21 change his mind, I'm sorry, but to me he's a pr1ma 
22 dona. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: This discussion you should 
24 all have by yourself and off the record. Here is 
25 the thing, and this is one thing that, I wasn't part 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 114 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 of the call, Sheila was. I'm asking her some of 
2 these questions because I asked her, now, I'm 
3 cross-exam1n1ng Sheila. 
4 
5 
MS. WHIRLEY: Not go1ng to happen. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Is he going to say 
6 something different than what he testified to? 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: And my understanding 1s, no, 
8 not necessarily different, unless that's a 
9 conclusion you may come up with. It is basically a 
10 more detailed and complete report regarding the 
11 trajectory of the bullets and the position that the 
12 body was in when it was shot. 
13 If you all recall something different that 
14 he said when he testified, I'm not suggesting that 
15 you are, but that's, you know, for you to decide. 
16 He basically said that his report would be about his 
17 findings, I'm repeating it, this is verbatim, the 
18 trajectory of the bullets and the position of the 
19 body when he was shot. I didn't question him any 
20 further than that. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: So we have the evidence all 
22 set up in the room for you. First of all, do you 
23 need me to call back to answer any 
24 further questions at this time? No, okay. 
25 Now, you all asked about the duty belt, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 115 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 which we do have 1n evidence and you will be able to 
2 see it, but I have the photographs of it when the 
3 duty belt was seized, and it looks like this was 
4 seized by Detective , who you have already 
5 heard from. 
6 So I will let you look at those and I'll 
7 mark the envelope that contains those photos. There 
8 are s1x 1mages, Grand Jury Exhibit 107. 
9 (Grand jury Exhibit Number 107 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Obviously we had some 
12 matters during the lunch hour that kind of kept me 
13 busy with things. I did try to look for that 
14 Quantico report about the gunshots that you hear. 
15 And I know I have it, I haven't had really time to 
16 search through my stuff for it. So while you are 
17 looking at evidence, I will try to lay my hands on 
18 that as well. 
19 You want to hear the interview of 
20 
21 
before you go look at the evidence? Yes. 
So, can you tell me, can I look at my 
22 little chart. 
23 (Playing of the interview of

Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 THE WITNESS: He wasn't there. And then I 
2 remember him asking me is it okay to come in the 
3 doors and he eventually came. 
4 THE FBI: Okay. I think the other p1ece 
5 of information that you wanted to tell us about was 
6 a video recorder that was removed, video camera that 
7 was removed. Can you tell me a little bit about 
8 that? 
9 THE WITNESS: That came into my mind when 
10 I spoke, another eyewitness who was g1v1ng me 
11 details of the entire thing. 
12 THE FBI: Who was that that you are 
13 talking to? 
14 THE WITNESS: The eyewitness, 
15 telling me that.

3 about this incident, the shooting of Michael 
4 Brown? 
5 
6 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
THE FBI: And it sparked something 1n your 
7 head about cameras or? 
8 THE WITNESS: Well, I was just trying to 
9 get information or details about what happened. 
10 
11 
THE FBI: Okay. 
THE WITNESS: Since I live in the 
12 community I was just curious what happened. 
13 
14 
(inaudible.) 
THE FBI: So she's the one that told you 
15 that this camera had been removed? 
16 
17 
18 removed?

20 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
THE FBI: You didn't see the camera 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: Okay. Do you know which camera 
21 it was, did she tell you? 
22 THE WITNESS: No. 
23 THE FBI: Well, then that's something we 
24 can follow-up with her since you don't have any 
25 independent knowledge of that camera, it 1s 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 126 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 something that she has the knowledge of which camera 
2 and who removed it from where it was? 
3 THE WITNESS: Right. 
4 THE FBI: Was there anything else in the 
5 shooting of Michael Brown that would be helpful for 
6 us? 
7 
8 anything. 
9 
THE WITNESS: No, I can't think of 
THE FBI: I asked you before about whether 
10 you would be willing to share the video that you 
11 showed to us today, is that something you are 
12 willing to share with us? 
13 
14 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
THE FBI: We will go ahead and have you 
15 s1gn a form that allows, you know, gives us 
16 authorization to take that off your phone and take a 
17 copy of that directly off your phone. 
18 Okay. Anything else? 
19 I don't want to get into what she told 
20 you, what you talked with her. Do you have any 
21 information, a way to contact her? 
22 
23 
24 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: You don't. 
THE WITNESS: I mean, well, she has a 
25 sister that I talk to, so her sister.

19 
20 
roommate 
THE FBI: Did you talk to, your other

, did you talk to that roommate, did that 
21 roommate, did she see anything, was she outside? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
THE WITNESS: No, she was inside. 
THE FBI: She was inside. 
THE WITNESS: She was inside. 
THE FBI: So she may have heard something, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 128 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 she was not outside to be able to see anything.

THE FBI: Okay. Again, any other 
4 questions? 
5 
6 
7 
Do you have s address? 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: Okay. All right. The time is 
8 now 7:26, we'll go ahead and stop the recording. 
9 (End of the recorded interview.) 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Is that the only thing that 
11 we're listening to? 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS Kathi Alizadeh, we 
13 just played off of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 49, 
14 which is a disc, we just played a statement from 
15 , which was recorded by the FBI 
16 previously, previous to his testimony before this 
17 grand Jury. 
18 Are there any other recorded statements 
19 that I indicated to you that we have available? 
20 Just for the record's sake, as well as for y'all to 
21 know, on that list I should indicate what exhibit 
22 the statements are on. So if at any time, even 
23 during your deliberations you want to hear it, I can 
24 play it for you. 
25 Sheila and I talked about the fact that if 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 129 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you want to listen to a witness' statement on a disc 
2 where there are multiple statements, probably if you 
3 can ask us to go ahead and cue it up. We can leave 
4 the room if you want to be alone and talk while its 
5 playing, there is a lot of people's statements on 
6 there that didn't get played because they say they 
7 didn't know anything or what have you. 
8 And then, but I will tell you statements 
9 that I did not have previously that I since have 
10 gotten. This is the statement of which 
11 was done, it is a two and a half hour statement that 
12 was done the night before he testified, and I've 
13 marked that as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 109. 
14 This is a disc that has a statement of 
15 that was done by the FBI on 
16 September 2nd of 2014. I didn't have that 
17 previously, that's Grand Jury Exhibit 108. And a 
18 recorded statement of that was done 
19 the day before she testified for you guys and that's 
20 Grand Jury Exhibit 110. 
21 So all of the statements that I've 
22 indicated that you have not heard you either have 
23 the transcripts for or I have them on disc for you 
24 to listen to whenever you need to, all right. 
25 With that being said. Any other 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 130 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 statements you want to listen to? You just let me 
2 know. 
3 At this point let's go ahead and take our 
4 break for y'all to take a bathroom break if you want 
5 and then reassemble here and then we will go look at 
6 the evidence in the room, 1s that all right? And 
7 then you guys can let us know what your decision is 
8 about 's report. 
9 (Recess) 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: It is November 21st, 
11 2:47p.m. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And my understanding is 
13 you're ready to get instruction on the law so that 
14 you can begin your deliberation. You've also made a 
15 decision you asked us to check on the report, 
16 autopsy report by I checked on it, I 
17 reported back and he said it was not ready, but he 
18 could have it ready by noon, which 1s on the east 
19 coast is my understanding, by noon on Monday. My 
20 understanding is you have agreed that you will wait 
21 for that report before turning in your decision; is 
22 that correct? Yes. However, you want to begin your 
23 deliberations now, correct? 
24 (Jurors indicate yes.) 
25 MS. WHIRLEY: We have prepared the law for 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 131 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you, we have prepared the relevant statutes, and 
2 Kathi is going to grab the indictments, they are 
3 ready. We just need to bring them in here and I'll 
4 pass this around. 
5 We have kind of reduced down the statute 
6 so that it is applicable to this case and easier to 
7 understand and read. Of course, if you have any 
8 questions along the way you can ask us by knocking 
9 on the door or ringing the bell. I guess r1ng1ng 
10 the bell would be better. And definitions that you 
11 think are applicable to the statutes. 
12 So we're going to the statutes, and will 
13 g1ve the foreperson the indictments and I will pick 
14 up the extras. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: So the indictments that we 
16 have prepared there 1s an indictment for murder 1n 
17 the first degree, a Class A felony and armed 
18 criminal action and unclassified felony, there 1s 
19 two cop1es. 
20 There 1s indictment for murder in the 
21 second degree and armed criminal, two cop1es. 
22 An indictment for voluntary manslaughter, 
23 a Class B felony, and armed criminal action, two 
24 COpleS. 
25 An indictment for involuntary manslaughter 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 132 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 in the first degree and armed criminal action, two 
2 COpleS. 
3 And involuntary manslaughter in the second 
4 degree and armed criminal action, two copies. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: The relevant statute it 
6 pretty much lays out the elements of the crimes that 
7 you have indictments for. It also has definitions 
8 that might be applicable to the crimes that are laid 
9 out in the statutes that you are looking at, it 1s 
10 not a statute, it is an indictment. 
11 
12 
The standard of proof is probable cause, 
we did confirm that. So you guys, that is what you 
13 have been working with probable cause all along 
14 s1nce you have been grand jurors and that doesn't 
15 change. Even though this has been a very long, 
16 arduous task going through this evidence. Your 
17 standard of proof is still probable cause. You're 
18 not here to determine guilt or not guilty, it 1s 
19 probable cause, is it enough to go to trial. 
20 Now, what makes this a little bit 
21 different is that if you will look on page, the 
22 first page, it talks about assault of a law 
23 enforcement officer in the first degree. And that's 
24 part of the indictment because the officer is say1ng 
25 he was arresting him for assaulting him. So that's 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 133 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 what you would be considering 1n your deliberation 
2 and we have provided you with definitions of assault 
3 1n the first degree, on the second page 1s assault 
4 1n the second degree and the third degree. And then 
5 also a law enforcement officer's use of force in 
6 making an arrest. An officer can use force in 
7 making an arrest, got that laid out for you. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Real quick, can I interrupt 
9 about something? 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Sure. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Previously 1n the very 
12 beginning of this process I printed out a statute 
13 for you that was, the statute in Missouri for the 
14 use of force to affect an arrest. 
15 So if you all want to get those out. What 
16 we have discovered, and we have been going along 
17 with this, doing our research, is that the statute 
18 in the State of Missouri does not comply with the 
19 case law. 
20 This doesn't sound probably unfamiliar to 
21 you that the law is codified in a written form 1n 
22 books and they're called statutes, but courts' 
23 interpret those statutes. And so the statute for 
24 the use of force to affect an arrest in the State of 
25 Missouri does not comply with Missouri Supreme, I'm 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 134 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 sorry, United States Supreme Court cases. 
2 And so what Sheila has come up with 1s a 
3 statement of the law as to when an officer can use 
4 force to affect an arrest, that does track our 
5 Missouri Statute, but also takes into consideration 
6 what the Supreme Court says, okay. 
7 So the statute I gave you, if you want to 
8 fold that 1n half just so that you know don't 
9 necessarily rely on that because there is a portion 
10 of that that doesn't comply with the law. And then 
11 the thing that Sheila is giving you, that statement 
12 about use of force to affect an arrest, I don't know 
13 is that what you called it, is that the title. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Law enforcement officers use 
15 of force in making an arrest, yes. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: That does correctly state 
17 what the law is on when an officer can use force and 
18 when he can use deadly force in affecting an arrest, 
19 okay. 
20 I don't want you to get confused and don't 
21 rely on that copy or that print-out of the statute 
22 that I've given you a long time ago. 
23 
24 
25 
MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have a question? 
GRAND JUROR: So we're to disregard this. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is not entirely 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 135 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 incorrect or inaccurate, but there is something 1n 
2 it that's not correct, 1gnore it totally. 
3 GRAND JUROR: It is because of the 
4 federal? 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: Of a Supreme Court case and 
6 we must follow Supreme Court of the United States. 
7 It is Tennessee v. Garner, not that that matters 
8 much to you. 
9 GRAND JUROR: The Supreme Court, federal 
10 Supreme Court overrides Missouri statutes. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: As far as you need to know, 
12 just don't worry about that. 
13 
14 
15 statute. 
16 
17 law class. 
GRAND JUROR: All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Just disregard that 
MS. WHIRLEY: We don't want to get into a 
18 That's that one and 1s that all you want 
19 to say on that? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah, I wanted to point 
21 that out. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: Use of force and defense of 
23 a person, and we've added use of force and it is 
24 actually, I'm sorry, we consider it a self-defense 
25 instruction. So the first one is self-defense as it 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 136 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 relates to the information that you may have heard 
2 regarding Michael Brown. 
3 The second one 1s self-defense as it 
4 relates to the law enforcement officer. As you 
5 deliberate and looked at the indictment, if you have 
6 questions about definitions, again, we have provided 
7 definitions, so just refer to that sheet that you 
8 have. And then also, probable cause is the 
9 standard, but Kathi, something she added that, you 
10 know, I need to tell you unless you want to do it, I 
11 can do it. 
12 
13 
MS. ALIZADEH: No, you do it. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is that in order to vote 
14 true bill, you also must consider whether you 
15 believe Darren Wilson, you find probable cause, 
16 that's the standard to believe that Darren Wilson 
17 committed the offense and the offenses are what is 
18 1n the indictment and you must find probable cause 
19 to believe that Darren Wilson did not act in lawful 
20 self-defense, and you've got the last sheet talks 
21 about self-defense and talks about officer's use of 
22 force, because then you must also have probable 
23 cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not use 
24 lawful force in making an arrest. So you are 
25 considering self-defense and use of force in making 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 137 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 an arrest. 
2 You have all the information you need in 
3 those documents that we gave you to help in your 
4 deliberation. But again, if you have additional 
5 questions, we're here, we're not going anywhere, did 
6 you have something? 
7 
8 
GRAND JUROR: No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And that's enough to get you 
9 started and hopefully this will clarify things for 
10 you as you go through the indictments. And I think 
11 we have already talked about, you'll decide how you 
12 want to go through the indictments if you want to 
13 look at them one at a time, but you must make a 
14 decision whether it is true bill or no true bill for 
15 each indictment. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And as was brought up at 
17 the very beginning of this and what we have 
18 researched and discussed, the possibility of well, 
19 what if there's, you know, five people want to 
20 indict on murder first and five people that want to 
21 indict on murder second, and two people that don't 
22 want to indict. If you have nine people that vote 
23 indict on anything, then there will be an 
24 indictment. What that indictment is we will deal 
25 with if that happens, but there was some question, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 138 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 well, 1s it kind of like a hung Jury if we all can't 
2 agree on the charge. No. 
3 If there are n1ne people to vote for an 
4 indictment, regardless of what charge you are 
5 indicting on, then know that there will be an 
6 indictment and we will give you further instruction 
7 on what that indictment, what offense it will be. 
8 And the one thing that Sheila has 
9 explained as far as what you must find and as she 
10 said, it is kind of in Missouri it is kind of, the 
11 State has to prove 1n a criminal trial, the State 
12 has to prove that the person did not act 1n lawful 
13 self-defense or did not use lawful force 1n making, 
14 it is kind of like we have to prove the negative. 
15 So in this case because we are talking 
16 about probable cause, as we've discussed, you must 
17 find probable cause to believe that he committed the 
18 offense that you're considering and you must find 
19 probable cause to believe that he did not act in 
20 lawful self-defense. Not that he did, but that he 
21 did not and that you find probable cause to believe 
22 that he did not use lawful force in making the 
23 arrest. 
24 So if you guys need clarification on that 
25 when you get down to discussing it, I can print that 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 139 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 out or something, you understand the difference, the 
2 distinction, okay? 
3 GRAND JUROR: Tell us those three aga1n, 
4 one 1s committed the offense? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Probable cause to believe 
6 that he committed the offense, which means that he 
7 met all the elements of that offense. You remember 
8 that from your grand Jury days. And you must find 
9 probable cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not 
10 act in lawful self-defense and you must find 
11 probable cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not 
12 use lawful force in making an arrest. And only if 
13 you find those things, which is kind of like finding 
14 a negative, you cannot return an indictment on 
15 anything or true bill unless you find both of those 
16 things. Because both are complete defenses to any 
17 offense and they both have been raised in his, 1n 
18 the evidence. So any other questions about the law? 
19 Okay. And then just one last thing is 
20 that Sheila and I talked about making, we can't make 
21 a closing argument to you and we're not going to, 
22 but I wanted to say something and I asked Sheila if 
23 she would, if we could prepare a statement together 
24 to say and so I just wanted to first thank you. We 
25 both wanted to thank you and how difficult this has 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 140 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 been and the sacrifice that we know you all have 
2 family and jobs and we understand the burden it has 
3 been for you to be here for now 24 days, 25 days 
4 that you've actually been here. 
5 We also want you to understand that your 
6 decision, whatever it is, should be based on the 
7 evidence that you heard in here and the law that 
8 we've explained to you, not based upon what the 
9 media says, not based upon public opinion, not based 
10 upon your fears, you have to base it on the evidence 
11 and the law. 
12 And whatever that decision is, it will be 
13 the correct decision and we will stand by that 
14 100 percent, whatever your decision 1s. 
15 And then finally I wanted to say, and 
16 Sheila agrees, but we wanted to point out that if at 
17 times it seemed like in our questions we were 
18 somehow expressing our op1n1ons either about what we 
19 think the evidence 1s, or about the credibility of a 
20 witness. We want you to understand as attorneys it 
21 is our job to challenge witnesses' statements and 
22 that sometimes, you know, you don't get to the truth 
23 unless you challenge a witness statement. 
24 We have not had any particular rhyme or 
25 reason what witnesses we have taken, we have kind of 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 141 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 traded off just because we are sharing the workload, 
2 but if at any time you felt that we were trying to 
3 express our opinion to you, we certainly were not. 
4 Sheila said, as attorneys either of us can 
5 argue either point effectively and well because 
6 that's what we do, but in challenging witnesses, and 
7 I know that many of you have asked challenging 
8 questions of the witnesses as well, it is up to you 
9 to determine the facts and it 1s up to you to 
10 determine the credibility of the witnesses that 
11 testify and don't read into anything about what you 
12 think our op1n1ons are because really our opinions 
13 don't matter, it is up to you and what you guys 
14 think. 
15 So with that being said, thank you, thank 
16 you very much. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you very much. And I 
18 just want to add, you know attorneys, they cannot 
19 stop talking. I have to have the last word. That I 
20 totally agree with that and we were trying to g1ve 
21 you a balanced presentation of the evidence. So you 
22 might see us go back and forth because we are trying 
23 to keep it balanced for you, and get to the truth 
24 and hopefully that was accomplished. 
25 And I think you are going to make the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 142 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 right decision, I think you are very bright, I have 
2 said that since I first met you many, many months, 
3 ago it seems now. Do you work, if you need 
4 anything, we will be out here. Thank you. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, do you want to go on 
6 record and say what time it is and that we are then 
7 leaving the room. 
8 I know I got the last word in, didn't I. 
9 (Grand jury starts deliberations at 3:04 
10 p.m.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: It is approximately 5:55 
12 p.m. and we are going to recess for the evening and 
13 reconvene Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. We are 
14 waiting on the autopsy report of and we 
15 are hoping it will be here before noon Monday. So 
16 with that, we are in recess for today.
