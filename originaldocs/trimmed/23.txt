MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. It is 
Page 5 
3 Thursday, November 13th at 9:26 a.m. This is Kathi 
4 Alizadeh of the prosecutor's office, Sheila Whirley 
5 is present, all 12 grand jurors are present, as is 
6 the court reporter. And I apologize, we're kind of 
7 getting a late start. We have our first witness in 
8 the morning here. We've had to meet with him a bit 
9 and he's reviewing some materials right now and then 
10 we had a discussion briefly before going on the 
11 record this morning about scheduling and about what 
12 might be in store for today. And then for the dates 
13 in the future that you have already given us and so 
14 with that being said, we'll just start the day and 
15 Sheila will take the first witness of the day who is 
16 Dr. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: He's looking at some 
18 photographs, so he needs just a few more minutes. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. We'll go ahead

11 Q And I just want to reiterate on the record 
12 for the grand jurors that we had already talked 
13 about, you know, that you're not supposed to discuss 
14 anything that we talk about here in the grand jury, 
15 correct? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q And that even any fact which the 
18 foreperson mentioned, any fact or thing that may 
19 come to your knowledge that you've discussed here at 
20 all.

Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are you a forensic pathologist? 
Yes. 
What exactly --
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, for the record, I 
10 don't think he said his name. We haven't had him 
11 introduced. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: We had talked a little bit 
13 about that, I guess I skipped that step. 
14 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Please introduce yourself 
15 and say your name and spell your name? 
16 A 
17 Q And in the future what I'm going to try to 
18 do and that's probably why I skipped asking, I'm 
19 going to refer to you as doctor and not use your 
20 name for many reasons. 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Okay, thank you. 
Getting back to forensic pathology. What 
23 does that mean? 
24 A Pathology is one of the 24 specialties in 
25 medicine, like OBGYN, dermatology, surgery,

1 pathology is a specialty that deals with finding out 
2 what's wrong with the body as opposed to treatment. 
3 So we're the doctors in the hospital 
4 who run the laboratory to see what the blood count 
5 is, what the PSA is, what the liver chemistries are 
6 and tell the treating doctors if there is evidence 
7 of liver disease or kidney disease or prostate 
8 problems, and that's the pathologist's role in the 
9 hospital communicating with doctors who are treating 
10 patients. 
11 Also, the pathologist's role is 
12 looking at biopsies, you know, breast biopsies, skin 
13 biopsies, to tell the treating doctor what kind of 
14 condition, cancer, not cancer, something else. And 
15 then the treating doctor does the treatment. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A So there are a number of divisions in 
18 pathology. The biggest division is hospital 
19 pathology. Where the pathologist looks at the 
20 biopsies, do autopsies, find out what's wrong with 
21 the patient, look at the chemistry of the body. 
22 And there are separate examinations, 
23 board examinations so that in all 24 fields, so that 
24 a patient looking for a doctor can tell whether the 
25 dermatologist has passed his boards or not and all

1 the specialties have to do you have to show the 
2 right training in the medical school, the right 
3 training in the residency program and pass various 
4 exams. And if so, then one is a diplomate or board 
5 certified physician, and that's of importance for 
6 others to know the extent of expertise that person 
7 has before going to the doctor. 
8 Pathology has three big divisions 
9 that I'm involved with. One is anatomical 
10 pathology, which has to do with the anatomy of the 
11 body. That's where autopsies, looking at biopsies 
12 under the microscope and tissues under the 
13 microscope, is evaluated to see what the anatomical 
14 structure of the body is and what's normal or not, 
15 that's anatomical pathology. 
16 Second division will be clinical 
17 pathology, which has to do with the chemistry of the 
18 body to see what's the blood count and the urine 
19 testing, et cetera, which gives us information about 
20 body function or organ functions. 
21 And that's the prime role in 
22 hospitals, anatomical and clinical pathology. 
23 Forensic pathology goes a step further to look into 
24 unnatural deaths, accident, suicide, homicide.

1 about my background. I served as medical examiner 
2 in New York City for 25 years, including the role of 
3 chief medical examiner in New York City. And then I 
4 transferred to the State of New York and I was chief 
5 forensic pathologist for the New York State Police 
6 for some 25 years. 
7 Recently retired, and I'm in private 
8 practice of forensic pathology. 
9 Q How many years total would you have in 
10 experience? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
More than 50 years. 
Okay. Have you any experience, are you a 
13 toxicologist also? 
14 A No, I'm not a toxicologist who specializes 
15 in finding drugs, but all forensic pathologists have 
16 to be experts in interpreting what the toxicologist 
17 finds. So the toxicologist's role is largely 
18 chemistry and finding drugs, finding quantities, how 
19 much of the drug is present, but it is really the 
20 physician, medical doctor who interprets the results 
21 and sees how it affects any illness the person has 
22 or affects what treatment should be given.

24 your training in pathology?

15 autopsies you performed, tell us exactly what is an 
16 autopsy? 
17 A Autopsy is a systematic external and 
18 internal examination of the human body to determine 
19 any abnormalities that might be present and any 
20 information that might be useful in determining 
21 cause of death of how a person died.

23 specimens for toxicology, for DNA, for microscopic 
24 examination to look at tissues. So that the autopsy

1 death and the circumstances around death. 
2 Q We're here today because of the shooting 
3 of Michael Brown and we've asked you to come before 
4 us because you actually did what sounds like was a 
5 private autopsy on Michael Brown; is that correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q You were aware that he had a first autopsy 
8 that was performed by St. Louis County?

12 Do you recall when you would have 
13 done your autopsy, what date that would have been? 
14 A Yes, it was Sunday, I came on Sunday 
15 around August, hold on a second. About August 17th, 
16 I guess, August 17th of this year.

1 Q How did you get invited to do that 
2 autopsy, or how did you examine become involved in 
3 that? 
4 A As I recall, I was called by an attorney 
5 for the family, Mr. was the attorney for the 
6 family, and he called me and asked if I could come 
7 and do a second autopsy. 
8 Q And now that you are in private practice, 
9 how long have you been in private practice? 
10 A Well, part of being a medical examiner, my 
11 50 years starting in New York City was to do private 
12 practice in addition to medical examiner work in 
13 part because traditionally medical examiners always 
14 work for counties and always got paid less than 
15 other doctors, they make up on it, you can do some 
16 private work. So I do private work also, but since 
17 2012, I think, I've been doing more private work 
18 when I retired from the State Police. 
19 Q And does that consist of you doing second 
20 autopsies generally?

1 optionies, doing first autopsies, and testifying 
2 about the findings sometimes. 
3 Q Now, and you mention money, so that kind 
4 of prompts me to ask this question. Were you paid 
5 to do this autopsy concerning Michael Brown? 
6 A No, I am doing this pro bono and about a 
7 third of the work I do is pro bono. 
8 Q How do you make that decision what's going 
9 to be pro bono? 
10 A A lot of that is how much, whether the 
11 family can afford it or not. If an autopsy is 
12 indicated, then I would work it out if they can't 
13 afford to pay anything, do it for pro bono and that 
14 involves a lot of work for families and for 
15 institutions, some institutions. 
16 You have to pay for the 
17 expenses of the travel and the hotel here or the 
18 family pay for that? 
19 A Urn, my expenses coming and going is paid 
20 for by the attorneys. They pay for that, yes. 
21 
22 Q 
Thank you. 
(By Ms. Whirley) Where did you perform 
23 your autopsy at? 
24 A It was the funeral home where the body was 
25 removed from the Medical Examiner's Office, if I

1 recall, the Lane Funeral Home who had been hired by 
2 the family to do the burial services. 
3 Q Was the body embalmed when you made 
4 contact with the body for the first time? 
5 A Yes, when I saw the body on Sunday, the 
6 17th, the body had already been embalmed. 
7 Q Does that affect your finding in any way? 
8 A It does have an affect. I prefer to do 
9 autopsies without embalming. One, it interferes 
10 with a lot of toxicology if that were needed because 
11 the embalming process changes the chemical makeup of 
12 the body. 
13 But also it changes the way injuries 
14 look, the embalming process is largely formaldehyde, 
15 replacing blood in the body, does change the 
16 appearance of the wounds on the body and so to that 
17 extent. 
18 Q Did you feel that you were able to look at 
19 the body, and I'm sure I'll ask you in a minute, all 
20 the documents and information that you have viewed 
21 or inspected to come up with your findings, did you 
22 feel that you were able to make an accurate finding 
23 though based on even the body being embalmed 
24 already? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I thought I could make an approximate

1 finding. 
2 
3 
4 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
I could tell bullet holes. 
Okay. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 17 
5 A For example, but some bullet holes may be 
6 difficult to tell entrance or exit after the body is 
7 embalmed. And certain injuries are diminished in 
8 appearance because the embalming process takes out 
9 color from the body, it causes the color to be gray 
10 in the body, more so than during life. 
11 Q Tell us what information, documents or 
12 things that you inspected to come up with your 
13 finding, and you did not write a report. You just 
14 recently viewed some things that were necessary; is 
15 that right? 
16 A Yesterday I viewed a lot of materials that 
17 are important in arriving at conclusions. So what 
18 I'm telling you today incorporates much of what I 
19 saw yesterday. 
20 Q Tell us everything you viewed to come to 
21 your conclusions? 
22 A Initially, initially, I do the decedent, 
23 Mr. Brown, who had already been autopsied, that also 
24 changes, the autopsy itself can change appearance of 
25 injuries and wounds, especially things that are

1 removed from the body. Obviously, bullets are 
2 removed. We can't see where the bullets wound up, 
3 but we see the spaces where they were. 
4 The organs are dissected, there are 
5 changes in appearance of wounds just on the basis of 
6 the first autopsy and the embalming adds onto it. 
7 So I asked at the beginning, and 
8 yesterday I was able to see the following of those. 
9 Went to the Medical Examiner's Office, very 
10 courteous and professional. They have photographs 
11 and x-rays, they took a lot of x-rays. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
What do the x-rays help you with? 
The x-rays show what the body looked like 
14 before the autopsy was done. The x-ray was taken 
15 before, about 30 x-rays or so. They show fractures 
16 that were there because sometimes during an autopsy 
17 the person doing the autopsy causes fractures, 
18 necessary to open up the chest cage and things. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And so the x-rays are the best indicator 
21 where the bullets are, can see right where the 
22 bullets were, which bones were intact and which 
23 bones were fractured before the incisions were made. 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I see. 
The autopsy is done with two incisions.

1 One for the chest and abdomen, and one for the head. 
2 And that, so that was helpful. There 
3 were x-rays and photographs. The photographs, 
4 though, at the Medical Examiner's Office were all 
5 after the first autopsy was done. That is after the 
6 autopsy sutures and all and went from the Medical 
7 Examiner's Office to the police department and there 
8 was able to view the autopsies (sic) the police took 
9 and they took many photographs of the body before 
10 the autopsy was done. They were extremely helpful. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
13 helpful. 
14 Q 
15 A 
We have some of those photographs. 
Yes, I went through some that might be 
Okay. 
And that answered a lot of questions I had 
16 as to entrance, exit, closeness of the gun at the 
17 time of discharge. 
18 I also looked at clothing, the 
19 clothing was very important. Clothing is always, 
20 the two most important to the hospital pathologist, 
21 90 percent, 95 percent of pathologists in the 
22 country, hospital pathologists, the most important 
23 part of an autopsy is internal organ, the heart, the 
24 brain, the lungs, kidneys, they're important, that's 
25 where natural diseases occur.

1 To the forensic pathologist the most 
2 important is the skin, that's where we see all 
3 patterns of injury, we see forensic evidence, trace 
4 evidence, blood, hairs, fiber, semen, saliva, that 
5 can be on the outside of the body. 
6 And the skin, the clothing is part of 
7 the skin to us because the clothing and the skin 
8 contain patterns of injury, gunshot powders, cut 
9 wounds, and also trace evidence. 
10 At the police headquarter building 
11 was able to look through and see all of the many 
12 photographs that were taken by the police and in the 
13 body in the virgin state for us. Having not been 
14 washed or touched or anything and the clothing. 
15 Q The clothing, the x-rays, the body, you 
16 actually saw the body?

1 officially released. I'm always concerned about 
2 leaked information as to how accurate it is. And 
3 yesterday when I went to the Medical Examiner's 
4 Office, I was provided with an official copy with 
5 the gross autopsies, the microscopic studies and 
6 toxicology, which turned out to be pretty similar to 
7 what had come out before, but the family still has a 
8 copy too. If I may interject. 
9 Q Sure. 
10 
11 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm sorry, if you may what? 
A Interject about the family. The reason 
12 that I was called by Mr. , you know, a week 
13 later rather than right away, sometimes families are 
14 concerned about a death, they want a second autopsy, 
15 they don't trust the first one necessarily, they 
16 call the next day. The reason that there was a week 
17 delayed as explained to me is that the family had 
18 been waiting for some information about the death, 
19 cause of death, for example. 
20 And also I find, in all our work as 
21 medical examiners when we see next of kin and 
22 whether it's everyday work or situation like this, 
23 one of the questions the family often has is did he 
24 suffer, did my loved one suffer in dying.

1 is explain what happened and to try to make it as 
2 less suffering as possible, make them feel a little 
3 bit the art of being a medical examiner. 
4 In this incident they hadn't heard 
5 anything, they read the stuff in the newspaper. The 
6 reason I came down was to do my examination because 
7 they didn't know they were going to get information 
8 as to cause of death. They know he was shot, they 
9 didn't know how much he was shot and where he was 
10 shot. To this day they still haven't received a 
11 report. I got it yesterday, the family hasn't 
12 gotten an official report so that's one of the 
13 reasons why families get a second autopsy. I'm a 
14 great believer in media transparency, that's another 
15 topic. 
16 So when I met with the family that 
17 was the first question was, did he suffer. I 
18 explained when that, one of bullet wounds in the top 
19 of the head went through the brain, that immediately 
20 caused him to lose consciousness. So that made them 
21 feel a little better he wasn't laying around in 
22 pain. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A Then I gave my opinion about at least six, 
25 there was a press conference that occurred the next

2 six bullets struck the body.

A

A 
We're going to get to that. 
So that's 
Okay. 
Even though I hadn't had all the new 
7 information, I'll paraphrase it, that's the kind of 
8 information I could give. 
9 Q Since you have gotten some additional 
10 information as recent as yesterday, that doesn't 
11 change your opinion as to how many shots the body 
12 received though? 
13 A No, I think that in going over everything, 
14 my opinion now is that there were seven bullets that 
15 struck the body. 
16 Q We'll go through that in just a minute. 
17 So you did get a chance to review the medical 
18 examiner's report and also the toxicology report; is 
19 that correct?

Q You determined it was a hand wound? 
A Well, yes, but they told me that. 
Q Someone told you it was a hand wound? You 
4 didn't make that determination? In your opinion was 
5 it a hand wound? 
6 A Yes, yes. Slides, you know, are labeled, 
7 so that, and the only slide because that was the 
8 only slides they took. 
9 Q Okay. 
10 A They didn't do microscopic examine of the 
11 heart, lung, all of that, which is usually done. 
12 The only sections that they make slides out of was 
13 the right-hand wound.

2 helpful in you explaining the injuries to Michael 
3 Brown, correct?

7 autopsy?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Who assisted you? 
There was a young man named 
Is he also a medical examiner or a doctor? 
No, no, he was a person that had been 
13 hired before I got there, it was days before I got 
14 there. Who was an assist to the autopsy. Everybody 
15 in an autopsy needs an assistant, often the funeral 
16 director to help move the body and things like that. 
17 And in this instance they had 
18 engaged, I'm not sure what this young man who was to 
19 assist. 
20 Q Because you didn't hire him, he wasn't 
21 someone on your team that you brought in? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Had you met him before? 
Not that I recall. He brought a

1 student, not medical student, at the University of 
2 Kansas and I came to the University of Kansas to do 
3 an autopsy in some controversial matter that he was 
4 a student, had worked summers at the medical 
5 examiner's office there and he was there. I signed 
6 a picture for him and he brought the picture and to 
7 remind me, he was, I think, a college student at 
8 that time.

Q 
A 
11 anything. 
12 Q 
Okay. 
But I had never worked with him or 
I see. So let's go back to the funeral 
13 home that Sunday. Was it early in the morning when 
14 you went to the funeral home that Sunday to do the 
15 autopsy? 
16 A I came in early morning by plane from New 
17 York and I guess it was 11:00, 12:00, 1:00 when I 
18 started the autopsy. I was picked up at the airport 
19 in St. Louis and brought down to the funeral home 
20 and shortly thereafter, began the re-autopsy. 
21 Q Re-autopsy. How long do you think that 
22 re-autopsy took? 
23 A Oh, probably about four hours or so, plus 
24 or minus an hour, take a few hours. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
When you first saw the body, what

1 condition was it in? I know it was embalmed, I 
2 mean, was it ready for autopsy or was, go ahead. 
3 A The body had been, the body had been in 
4 the funeral parlor long enough to be embalmed, so it 
5 had been there for a few days. The body was on a 
6 table, one of the embalming tables in the funeral 
7 parlor similar to autopsy tables ready for 
8 re-autopsy. 
9 Q What does that look like when you say 
10 ready for re-autopsy? 
11 A I think it was, I don't recall 
12 specifically, a sheet over the body, a white sheet. 
13 When I removed the sheet, the body was on the metal, 
14 the top of the autopsy table and nude. 
Q Was it sutured or not? 15 
16 A The body was sutured. There are two 
17 incisions that are made in an autopsy, one is what 
18 is called the Y shaped incision. It goes from left 
19 shoulder down to the breast bone and the right 
20 shoulder down and then down to the pubic area. When 
21 it is opened up, it permits examination of the chest 
22 organ, the heart and lungs, the abdominal organs, 
23 which -- and then that's sutured up afterwards. And 
24 then there is one incision, second incision is made 
25 from back of the, ear to ear, the back of the head

1 that permits removal of the tissue of the skin to 
2 bend them forward and take the brain out and examine 
3 the brain. 
4 And then when these sutures are, when 
5 these incisions are sewed up, this is universal. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A In other countries as well. When the 
8 incisions are sewed up, one can present the body to 
9 the family, clothing covers the chest incisions, and 
10 a pillow will cover the back incision so that in the 
11 normal course, one can tell by looking at the 
12 remains and paying respects whether an autopsy has 
13 been done or not. 
14 Q When you saw the body for the first time, 
15 it was sewed up, so you had to open it to do your 
16 autopsy?

23 the kind of things that funeral directors do when 
24 you go to a funeral home.

1 A And there's no special requirement and 
2 that he also then, he had seen the body before it 
3 was embalmed, you know, when it came there and he 
4 gave me, told me what it looked like before the 
5 embalming. I think he had some pictures of that, 
6 but I don't recall specifically. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A He was interested in trying to work out 
9 the different bullet tracks, which gave me some 
10 opinions about. 
11 Q But you made the determination of the 
12 bullet tracks? 
13 A Oh, yes. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I interrupt you for a 
15 minute. What you said that, who was interested in 
16 determining the bullet tracks, is that Mr. 
17 A Yes, he was a very enthusiastic young 
18 person. He was making suggestions to me, well, this 
19 bullet track that went in the head on the top and 
20 things like that, but my opinions are my own. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Sure. I just didn't hear 
22 who you said.

24 myself, and also he could photograph. He had a

1 it was being performed. 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Do you feel that your 
3 autopsy is independent of St. Louis County's autopsy 
4 or how would you categorize it? 
5 A It is independent of it sure, but I review 
6 what I could tell from the examination what St. 
7 Louis County Medical Examiner's Office had done. 
8 They had done a thorough examination and by 
9 examining, you know, status of the organs, all the 
10 organs have been dissected and placed in a plastic 
11 bag at the time and the bullet tracks were still 
12 apparent. 
13 Q Okay. 
14 A They weren't removed, the bullets were 
15 removed, but not the bullet tracks. 
16 Q So tell us what you did as you performed 
17 your autopsy and then we can maybe go through some 
18 photos if that's helpful or we can wait on the 
19 photos, so kind of tell us what did you do first 
20 when you arrived there? 
21 A What I did first was examine the outside 
22 of the body. And to examine the head, the front, 
23 the back is important to make sure that there was, 
24 there wasn't any kind of injury or perforation of 
25 the back that could be overlooked if one doesn't

Page 31 
2 Then a second autopsy often is easier 
3 than the first because the incisions have been made, 
4 the ribs have been cut through, the skull bones have 
5 been cut through to get to the brain. So in one 
6 sense it is easier, of course, it doesn't tell you 
7 as much as the first autopsy necessarily. Because 
8 the first autopsy has changed things around a bit. 
9 So in this situation, when I review 
10 the internal organs, they're pretty normal in 
11 appearance for the age and his build and all. 
12 There were bullet perforations of the 
13 right lung that then coincided, correlated with 
14 gunshot wounds on the outside of the body. A large 
15 part of the autopsy had to do with reconstructing 
16 what the bullet wounds were, where they entered, 
17 where they exited, and then to my interpretation two 
18 bullet wounds could have been reentry wounds. I 
19 couldn't be certain about those until I saw what the 
20 official autopsy showed, which is one I received 
21 recently, yes. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And the photographs. So that was a large 
24 part of what I did is to determine the nature of the 
25 gunshot wounds and the direct entrance, exit,

Page 32 
2 Q That's what we certainly want to know 
3 about. 
4 So you open the body and you 
5 inspected the body for injuries and wounds, gunshot 
6 wounds and photographs were taken? 
7 A First thing I did, the biggest time was 
8 spent looking at the outside of the body. 
9 Q Outside of the body? 
10 A Before opening up the inside. 
11 Q Before we talk about any of the gunshot 
12 wounds, let's talk about other potential injuries. 
13 You may or may not have seen them. Did you see any 
14 bruising to the body, like bruises on the knees or 
15 anywhere on the body, did you note any bruising? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Can you tell us where you noted the 
18 bruising? 
19 A Well, I thought the significant bruising 
20 was around the right eye. He had a lot of bruising, 
21 I'm still not clear about how it developed, above 
22 the eye and on the side and below the right eye. In 
23 addition to the gunshot wound that went through the 
24 eye. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
So you think the bruising had nothing to

Grand Jury, Volume XXIII November 13, 2014 
Page 33 
1 do, not nothing to do, was not from the gunshot 
2 wound that you are discussing? 
3 A No, there was a gunshot wound, I'm sure 
4 the people are familiar better than I am than what 
5 I'm talking about right now. There was one gunshot 
6 wound of entrance just right of the forehead or so 
7 and that went down and caused a lot of damage, went 
8 downhill through the eye and the orbit. 
9 In addition to that, there was 
10 scraping abrasions around the eye, bullet wounds 
11 don't cause scraping abrasions, rubbing abrasions 
12 against something. 
13 Q That prompts me to ask you, did you get 
14 any information as to the fact of what happened, did 
15 you get any witnesses' versions of what occurred 
16 during this shooting? 
17 A I did read an occasion when up in New York 
18 the controversy that was going on in Ferguson, some 
19 people, the hands were up, some people said he was 
20 charging the officer, so I was familiar with the 
21 controversy. 
22 Q Did you hear that he fell face forward 
23 once he has shot in the head, did you hear that? 
24 A I would assume that bullet wound in the 
25 head causes immediate lost of consciousness and

1 ability to stand upright. So he would have fallen 
2 after being shot in the head, yes. 
3 Q So if he fell face forward, would that 
4 account for the bruising that you are referring to 
5 or you don't think, tell us what you think? 
6 A I don't know. Probably, and to this day I 
7 don't know. Maybe I should have gone over to the 
8 scene to see the composition of the roadway that he 
9 fell on. 
10 But usually falling face down, for 
11 example, causes bruising of the nose. The face is 
12 kind of protected. We have, people normally, normal 
13 person falls face forward instinctively put their 
14 hands out to protect themselves. 
15 When somebody loses consciousness or 
16 somebody is drunk, you see this in people who are 
17 drunk, they can fall face forward and not 
18 instinctively protect themself. And then the 
19 bruising in the prominences of the face, the nose 
20 gets most of the damage. 
21 The eye sockets don't, they are 
22 recessed a bit. So I think that by falling face 
23 down, and then falling face down you get ruptured 
24 blood vessels and bruises being black and blue 
25 marks. Abrasions being scrape marks on the skin,

1 like your child falls down and skids along some 
2 ground, they can get scrapes. 
3 The scrapes are different than black 
4 and blue marks. There were scrapes here. So it 
5 happen to rub against something, it is rubbing of 
6 the outer layer of the skin. I don't think that 
7 would have occurred from an unprotected fall. And 
8 the nose was not that damaged either. 
Q Okay. 9 
10 A Just because you lose consciousness 
11 doesn't mean you fall immediately, it's just 
12 crumbled to the ground is more common, you crumble 
13 down and fall. Different ways of falling and that 
14 it was more scraping, not clear why. 
15 Q What about bruising to his, did you see 
16 any bruising on his wrists or his arms? 
17 A I saw one of the wrists had a little bit 
18 of a bruise that I'm not sure what it was caused by. 
19 Looks like he had something around the wrist that 
20 caused a linear abrasion of some kind. I didn't 
21 think very significant. 
22 Q Is that something you can tell whether 
23 that bruise occurred contemporaneously with all of 
24 these injuries or is this looking like an old 
25 bruise. I know most doctors say it is difficult to

2 happened contemporaneously with all the injuries? 
3 A It could have, but it could have been 
4 there for a day before or something, not a week 
5 before. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A We can't tell a few minutes before death 
8 or a day before death by just looking at it. 
9 Sometimes under the microscope we can tell. But we 
10 could also, some of these injuries can occur after 
11 death, you know, when the person is put in a body 
12 bag and tied up in the body bag just so it doesn't 
13 move, that can leave patterns also on the dead body

1 A I know that's mentioned in the autopsy 
2 protocol. 
3 Q Okay. So let's look at some of the photos 
4 and you can tell us, first of all, you thought there 
5 was 17 shots that he received? 
6 A Seven different bullets that struck him. 
7 Q Okay. Tell us about that? 
8 A As oppose to bullet tracks. One of the 
9 tracks was a graze of the biceps of the arm and that 
10 came across the arm and didn't do any significant 
11 damage to Mr. Brown and it is very difficult to be 
12 able to tell direction from that. It was not close 
13 to, medical examiner is one to two feet or less. 
14 That is, we can tell distance, 
15 usually up to a foot or sometimes two feet, a foot 
16 and a half by the amount of powder that's 
17 distributed with the bullet. 
18 Beyond that, we can't tell two feet 
19 from 20 feet or 40 feet, you know, shot from 40 
20 would be the same marks and from 3 feet from a 
21 medical examiner's point of view. 
22

Q 
A 
Okay. 
So depending on the ammunition and the 
24 weapon discharged, 12 inches to 18 inches away

2 we judge closeness. 
3 Q Were any of the gunshot wounds that you 
4 observed, would you consider any of those close

How did you make that determination?

9 after the body, after the hand has been washed.

12 tell it was a gunshot graze just like the wound on 
13 the right biceps muscle, but not direction and not 
14 distance.

2 you direction. So inverted Christmas tree. 
3 The fact that these are going upwards 
4 would indicate that the entrance is down here and 
5 going in this direction. Because of, if you see 
6 this Christmas tree this way and upside down 
7 Christmas tree is going that way, that's how the 
8 tissues tear when there's a graze wound in areas of 
9 some loose tissue that's in the palm of the hand 
10 kind of thing. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So the entrance where it 
12 entered is tighter than where it came out, it starts 
13 to spread? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Yeah, but it is these things that tells. 
Okay. 
It goes in here and there is some on the 
17 print, there is a little bit of blackish, tiny bit 
18 of blackish coloration, and that's what the medical 
19 examiner found on the microscopic. It was 
20 interesting when I look at it, after the embalming 
21 because body gets washed and all of that, I couldn't 
22 see any powder. 
23 When the medical examiner looked at 
24 it in the fresh state, he didn't either because he 
25 puts in the autopsy that there's no gunshot powder

1 and then I didn't see any gunshot powder, he sees it 
2 under the microscope. 
3 When I look at this now and there's a 
4 little blackening there that I think is not due to 
5 any artifact, that's really blackening due to some 
6 powder. 
7 So that the weapon, the muzzle was 
8 near to this within a few inches, it wasn't contact, 
9 but within a few inches in my opinion at the time of 
10 discharge. 
11 Q Can you tell by that injury where the 
12 shooter and the person who was shot, what their 
13 positions were? 
14 A I can tell that the weapon, the muzzle of 
15 the weapon, in all of the reconstruction that 
16 medical examiners do, tell the muzzle of the weapon 
17 and the place the bullet enters where it is. So the 
18 gun had to be somewhere around, you know, that kind 
19 of a line, but I can't tell, we can't tell from an 
20 autopsy whether the hand is going forward or pulling 
21 backward or standing still. We can't tell whether 
22 the gun is going forward or backward. All we can 
23 say at the instant of firing, I would say roughly 
24 six, four, five, six inches away, the weapon was a 
25 few inches away at the time of the discharge and

1 struck. I wasn't able, I can't tell, the fingers 
2 could have been open or not open. 
3 But at this point the bullet would 
4 have gone at this point cut through the muscles 
5 here, and that's one of the things that would be 
6 important in reconstructing, which I couldn't get, I 
7 tried to, is the examination of the car was there a 
8 bullet in the car or a bullet imprinted in the 
9 vehicle to see if we knew where the bullet struck, 
10 then we get an even better lining up of what 
11 happened. 
12 Q Okay. There's two more photos, I don't 
13 know if they are helpful. 
14 A Yes, they are. 
15 Q This is Number 40, I'm saying this for the 
16 record, this is 49. 
17 A I thought that maybe in this photo there's 
18 a little better, a little blackening between the 
19 ridges, you can see the ridges in the skin and some 
20 little black soot deposit. That's what comes out of 
21 the bullet because when the bullet comes out, it is 
22 an explosion that pushes the bullet out and any 
23 explosion you get powder. You get carbon, soot 
24 carbon, and burned and unburned gunshot powder 
25 fragments.

It is your opinion 
This is essentially powder, so the heavy, 
3 and the powder would stay up until about four, 
4 five inches and then it goes away. 
5 Q Say that one more time, I'm trying to 
6 visualize. 
7 A When powder comes out of the muzzle of the 
8 gun, it goes for four or five inches and then it 
9 will dissipate. And the heavier tattooing would 
10 come from burnt, unburnt granules, not carbon. The 
11 blackening is carbon or soot. 
12 Q That's in your opinion that's what this 
13 is? 
14 A Yeah. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: Go ahead. 
16 You said you can't tell if 
17 the hand or gun is moving in or out or whatever? 
18 A That's correct. 
19 Can you tell angle, somebody 
20 sitting or standing by this?

1 direction. What I can't tell is whether anybody was 
2 sitting or standing, no, that's all I can relate to 
3 is the weapon, the gun and the target. And I can't 
4 because the wrist is so mobile see, it could be held 
5 upside down, sideways, all kind of different things. 
6 How it was being held I can't tell, but the fact 
7 that, so all we're doing is the muzzle to where the 
8 bullets land, the last one there.

10 
Q 
A 
Yeah, this is Exhibit Number 42. 
Did it show, yeah, that one. This is how 
11 the photograph was taken by the police before the 
12 hand was washed and there is a lot of blood around 
13 here, that this wound does cause a lot of bleeding, 
14 a lot of little capillaries and blood vessels there. 
15 And that became important in looking 
16 at the clothing. Why does he have blood on his 
17 clothing, you get shot and you get shot multiple 
18 places and glass. If this happened very quickly, he 
19 wouldn't really have time for blood to stop dripping 
20 out of any of the wounds he had and he would have 
21 collapsed immediately. And I think the blood on his 
22 clothing and the drops of blood, dripping of blood 
23 on his clothing, which is the lower part of the 
24 shirt, the upper shirt is a lot of blood, his pants 
25 or the shorts that he was wearing have a lot of

1 blood drops on it. And the socks he has on he had a 
2 lot of blood, had blood drops on it. So that he was 
3 bleeding, the only place he could have been bleeding 
4 from is this area from here. 
5 My opinion is whatever happened after 
6 incurring that wound, he was able to have blood from 
7 here drip onto his pants and clothing and his socks 
8 in whatever he was doing, walking or whatever he was 
9 doing or running. 
10 Q Were you able, based on your examination, 
11 to tell which wounds happened first and what 
12 sequence of shots, what the sequence was? 
13 A The only thing I can say this was the 
14 first wound. I cannot tell the other sequence. 
15 
16 
Q Why do you think this was the first wound? 
A Because of the bleeding that occurred when 
17 he left the car and that he had incurred the wound 
18 in the car just from the history and that. 
19 At some point he received the other 
20 wounds, the wound in the head would have been, would 
21 have caused him to lose consciousness. 
22 Q And be fatal? 
23 A However that's probably the last, to next 
24 to last. If his head was down and would indicate 
25 because in order for the wound to be inflicted in

1 the head, top of the head, the muzzle of the weapon 
2 has to be, this is kind of the wound in the top of 
3 the head. 
4 Now that could be somebody is up here 
5 in the ceiling and shoots down, they can give me 
6 that. If I'm lying on the ground and the muzzle of 
7 the gun I can get that, or if we accept the position 
8 of the shooter, you can't tell unless you know the 
9 position of the shooter. 
10 If he's standing up, as appears from 
11 what I've read, assuming that, then his head would 
12 have to be down so that the shooter would have to be 
13 able to fire at the top of his head. 
14 And if he's down and he fired three 
15 fast, quick shots, which could occur before he falls 
16 to the ground, he would have one in the head, one in 
17 the forehead that goes down through his jaw and one 
18 in the chest that all occur with three quickly fired 
19 shots. 
20 So even though he crumbles, starts 
21 falling immediately on the one in the head, and 
22 probably could have been the last shot, if three 
23 shots were gotten off, it could be done before he 
24 falls to the ground and he would be in a position 
25 with his head down for those three shots to occur.

19 A No, the barrel of the gun at this point I 
20 would expect more soot, well, I can't tell. The 
21 indentation I think is more postmortem. You can't 
22 say it happened before death because the body is 
23 moved, the skin, as I said, we find most common when 
24 tied up in the body bag or so, marks on the skin 
25 occur just from pressure, postmortem pressure can

shots one at a time and you prefer to

6 A Yeah. If you are going to do that, I put

8 MS. WHIRLEY: I may have messed up your 
9 order. 
10 A That's okay. The way we usually do it, 
11 way we do it in New York, with multiple gunshot 
12 wounds, we will describe the wounds and number them 
13 from the top down. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A That doesn't in any way signify the order 
16 of shots, because usually we can't tell the order of 
17 shots. So the number one that was, I think also was 
18 in the autopsy report. 
19 Q You kind of describe the head shot 
20 already, correct?

25 Louis Police Department who came to the Medical

1 Examiner's Office and the police took them all, not 
2 the medical examiner, the ones I looked at initially 
3 were medical examiner photographs I said, and that 
4 was after the autopsy had been done. So the police 
5 were there and they took all of these photos before 
6 the autopsy was done. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: These are out of that 
8 packet of photos, Grand Jury Exhibit Number 7. 
9 A Now, in this one, can you turn that front 
10 light out. This is a bullet wound of entrance, and 
11 again, no powder around it. More than 18 inches 
12 away. Can't tell how much more, and the bullet 
13 track, thank you, came down through the orbit, the 
14 eye and caused some fractures and exited down here 
15 through the jawbone on the side. 
16 So that was also, see, that would 
17 have lined up, as I tried to figure out if he were 
18 bent over to have the top of the head and then a 
19 parallel line going down and exiting here. 
20 And when I spoke about the abrasions, 
21 see the nose is pretty good. If he fell down and he 
22 got the injuries to the body, they should be more 
23 prominent on the nose and on both sides of the 
24 forehead, not just on one side of the forehead. 
25 And I don't know, these look like

1 superficial scrape marks. They can happen 
2 sometimes, I don't even know if after the body is on 
3 the floor and people in the course of removing the 
4 body to the body bags, pull the body because the 
5 person pulling the legs is stronger than the person 
6 holding the head, they can cause some scraping 
7 damage, but this is more than usual so I'm not sure 
8 why. 
9 You prescribed linear and/or 
10 scraping a relative motion between his face and 
11 whatever object he scraped against. If he had his 
12 head down and in a charging motion, meaning he had a 
13 motion toward the officer, when he fell with his 
14 final shots, could that have caused, I mean, that 
15 type of abrasion. 
16 A Yeah, but then it would be most prominent 
17 on the nose. 
18 
19 A 
What if his head was turned? 
Also, there would be the object, the sand 
20 or dirt would be incorporated in it. This looks 
21 like a very clean, this is before he was washed and 
22 this looks all very clean. The blood is still dried 
23 here so.

1 if it was turned toward the right side? 
2 Head down and turned? 
3 A It's possible, I've not seen this 
4 extensive from that, but I don't know what the 
5 composition of the ground is either, so that's 
6 possible. 
7 If he would have fallen 
8 square on his face, you would expect to see 
9 something on the nose? 
10 If there wasn't damage to 
11 the nose, that applies he didn't land on his nose 
12 first, he had to land on one side or the other? 
13 A If it was caused by his landing, yes. 
14 August 9th was a very, very, 
15 very hot day here. So could it possibly be the 
16 ground was hot and from the impact of the fall? 
17 A It's possible, it's possible. But it 
18 would require movement. Just lying there on the 
19 ground wouldn't cause the scraping abrasions, it's 
20 possible, it's possible. 
21 
22

A 
MS. WHIRLEY: We have another question? 
It is kind of prominent for that.

A Yes. 1 
2 We do know that he fell, 
3 with this impact, we know that he fell face forward. 
4 A Right. 
5 My understanding of his 
6 question is if he fell face forward, wouldn't there 
7 be something on his nose, disregarding these, 
8 wouldn't there be something on his nose that 
9 indicated he fell face forward? 
10 A Yes, but then he added on the question 
11 what if it was just on his right side. 
12 If he fell face forward, 
13 straight on, there would be something on his nose?

15

A 
Yes, yes. 
Some sort of an abrasion? 
Yes. 
17 So if he had his head down

3 MS. ALIZADEH: Because the injury is to 
4 the right side of his face. 
5 Right. 
6 A Yeah, if he fell on his right side and he 
7 moved forward you get certain abrasions. He also 
8 has cuts here, some of these are not just scrapes, 
9 but they're lacerations. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: They don't come from the 
11 gunshot wounds? 
12 A No, they don't come from the gunshot 
13 wound. the gunshot wound goes deeper and through the 
14 eye. If they came from the gunshot wound, the 
15 gunshot wound would be more to the outside. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Even if it was grazing? 
17 A This one is going into underlying soft 
18 tissue, so that it is underneath this. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I understand. 19 
20 A It is underneath the skin there and in 
21 order to graze you have to be on top of the skin.

I'm not sure why. I think the thing that 
2 puzzles me is the combination of factors. That some 
3 of it could be by scraping somehow, but not all of 
4 it. And if this were say a blow to the face causing 
5 laceration, it normally wouldn't cause a scraping 
6 wound. So it is some complex reason. 
7 Doctor, the top could be a 
8 small fragment, bone fragment that could do that? 
9 A Bone fragments can protrude through the 
10 skin, but in this instance it didn't, the bone 
11 fragments were largely the lower portion of the 
12 orbit and there was no bone fragments that were 
13 protruding. And that's the value of what the police 
14 did is that they took these photographs before any 
15 changes were made by the autopsy or by the 
16 embalming. And I think that's an interesting point, 
17 the bone fragments. I don't think it was caused by 
18 bone fragment, the fragmentation was lower down.

2 or if there were rocks in the road? 
3 A Right, yes. 
4 Okay. 
5 A That could affect it. And what I should 
6 say to you, when we do autopsies in our line of 
7 work, we try to answer as many questions and issues 
8 that we can. We often, there are findings that we 
9 can't explain. So that even issues like the cause 
10 here, I can't really explain it. And that, that 
11 often happens in autopsies, you explain the major 
12 ones that answer the question, but not everything. 
13 And there are other experts that is a 
14 gravel expert, they have gravel experts might have a 
15 better idea or somebody doing experiments on 
16 injuries to skin, which are very difficult to do now 
17 because it needs appropriate approval by boards that 
18 you can't do experiments on people that hurt people. 
19 However, they can do it on pigs and animals 
20 sometimes and there may be somebody around who is an 
21 expert on that, but it would be more able to answer 
22 the questions on that surface with the human skin. 
23 It is very similar to pig skin, would develop these 
24 injuries just from contact with the gravel falling 
25 with a certain force.

The other side, please, the other side 
I'm sorry, there we go. 
They don't train you how to do that in law 
13 school, I guess. 
14 Q I'm just not paying close enough 
15 attention. 
16 A What I would say here the bullet wound, 
17 they do everything nowadays these machines, bullet 
18 wound comes down through here and as I repositioned 
19 the head and all and look at all the additional 
20 photographs. I think the bent head that is right on 
21 top of the clavicle here, the collar bone, this 
22 bullet goes through here and this is a reentry 
23 wound. It looks to me like a reentry wound. 
24 I think the way the medical examiner 
25 put it down as a separate entrance. So in that

1 regard I have one less bullet that struck Mr. Brown 
2 than the medical examiner did, but it doesn't change 
3 anything substantially except for forensic pathology 
4 point of view. I think the bullet exits here, goes 
5 into here, hits the clavicle, hits the lungs and 
6 stops. 
7 A bullet that's going straight, the 
8 one that went through the head went through a lot of 
9 thick skull bone and a normal, which is another 
10 indication that it was kind of a spent bullet by the 
11 time that it goes through here and into the lung, 
12 which is right next to it, it has already lost most 
13 of its power. So that I think is reentrance that I 
14 think would be the difference in the way we organize 
15 the tracks. 
16 Here is the third bullet wound of the 
17 chest that I thought might be a reentry when I did 
18 the autopsy, but I think turns out with all the 
19 additional information I agree with the medical 
20 examiner that's an entry wound. 
21 So you have the head, the face, the 
22 facial one coming out here and this pretty much all 
23 could be within a foot or two if fired rapidly. 
24 Whether that was the last bullet wound or not in the 
25 head.

1 Q Okay. So far from what you've described 
2 in the photos we've seen, this would be, you talked 
3 about three entry wounds, three bullets? 
4 A Well, actually, yes. The head, the face, 
5 I'm not counting this one, this is a reentry. 
6 Q Right. 
7 A When I look at it close, it also has 
8 markings of a reentry. It is not quite as round as 
9 an entry wound would be. And this one would be 
10 three, three of the bullet wounds and these are the 
11 wounds, these are the wounds where bullets were 
12 recovered it turns out. 
13 The bullet was recovered here from 
14 the side of the face, right side through the brain 
15 from the side of the face and was recovered from 
16 within the autopsy of the head. 
17 The second bullet comes through the 
18 face into here and then is recovered in the area of 
19 the lung, and the third bullet here comes in here 
20 and largely goes through causing a fracture of the 
21 eighth rib. 
22 See up here is the third rib and this 
23 by the eighth rib and is found, goes through the 
24 eighth rib and the lung, the lower portion, this 
25 upper lung or lower lung on the right and it is

1 found next to the eighth rib in the back. 
2 And what we found in the second 
3 autopsy is that it was the incision made in the 
4 back, not through any injury as it was an incision 
5 made to recover that bullet. 
6 In order to recover the bullet in the 
7 back, it was underneath the skin, they had made some 
8 incisions at the time of the first autopsy and that 
9 all comes into how we have to examine bodies when 
10 there is a re-autopsy. We inferred that there was a 
11 bullet taken out, but I didn't see the photos until 
12 yesterday. 
13 Q And it certainly didn't look like any 
14 injury, he was shot in his back anywhere; is that

1 understand. We're talking about three bullets, but 
2 four bullet wounds because you consider one to be a 
3 reentry. 
4 A Yes, yes. 
5 When you are describing that 
6 reentry wound from the jaw, you had your head like 
7 this. (indicating) 
8 A Yes. 
9 So based on where it is in 
10 the jaw and it reenters in the body, it is pretty 
11 safe to say that the head, it was like this?

still present it would be 
19 with the skin of the jaw next to the clavicle, the 
20 inside, you can feel your collar bone, but right 
21 next to it so that that trajectory could occur. 
22 The reason I ask that 
23 question is because I think having your head like 
24 this versus just falling forward, it is going to 
25 show what you're doing more, do you understand what

1 I'm saying? 
2 A I see what you're saying. I'm not sure of 
3 the interpretation you have is as good of 
4 interpretation as I have, but it would be that the 
5 chin would be, if the chin were not right next to 
6 it, bullet coming out of the chin would have gone 
7 into a different place. 
8 What I'm saying is though 
9 that if he were simply falling forward, his head 
10 would be more lax? 
11 A Yeah, yes, I think that at the time he was 
12 shot his right side of his chin of the jaw was 
13 against the collar bone near the midline at the time 
14 he was shot. I can't tell from that whether he's 
15 going forward, going backwards, whether he's 
16 standing still, I'm just saying that. 
17 To explain that as a reentry 
18 wound and his head is that way, if that's not a 
19 reentry wound and it is separate bullet wound, his 
20 head could have been either or --
21 A If it is not a reentry wound, then it is a 
22 separate bullet wound and that bullet was recovered, 
23 those are the three that were recovered. 
24 That comes out of his right 
25 jaw, is that straight line from the entry point to

1 the exit point out that jaw through his skull a 
2 straight line or did it move as it traveled around 
3 his eye? 
4 A No, pretty much a straight line. The 
5 facial bones and the orbit bones, they're thin bones 
6 and essentially when the bullet goes through, stays 
7 within 5 or 10 degrees, it doesn't go around further 
8 than that in this kind of a setting. Especially a 
9 larger caliber bullet. We sometimes see funny 
10 things with a .22. 
11 People shot in the eye, 
12 right around the skull, no exit wound sometimes? 
13 A No, this is a straight wound and it winds 
14 up that way in probing it. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: All right. You got another 
16 one? 
17 A So those are the three or four.

19 ones.

1 any damage, a bullet that struck the body and as far 
2 as we know it struck the body and disappeared. It 
3 is not in the body and I didn't see anything in the 
4 clothing that would indicate that it landed there. 
5 The clothing, unfortunately, the 
6 T-shirt he was wearing, short sleeves, so it just 
7 goes up to around here. So in long sleeve shirts we 
8 could see more of an entrance and exit in clothing 
9 that would be helpful. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Did you see any gun powder 
11 on the clothing at all? 
12 A Nothing on the clothing. No gun powder on 
13 the clothing and from what I gather the police 
14 didn't either. 
15 And this is an entry wound from the 
16 front, the upper arm is, you've been told about the 
17 anatomical position, the imaginary anatomic position 
18 that medical examiners' use. In autopsies, body, 
19 palms forward at attention, all measurements are 
20 done that way. 
21 It is very rare that victims are that 
22 cooperative, so you can tell exactly what happened 
23 because the body is mobile and in this situation, if 
24 this is front anterior, the bullet came in near the 
25 top and came out the back, that's a front. In and

2 wound and I think the next one shows the 
3 controversial one. 
4 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. We'll do this one 
5 and then we'll take a break. Number 83, is this the 
6 right way, Doctor? 
7 A Yes, that's good, thank you. 
Q Sure. 8 
9 
10 
A What's interesting here this is. 
Q Should I bring it down a little bit, I 
11 don't know if that will help or not. 
12 A What's interesting to me is that, you 
13 know, the blood, nothing has been washed off. This 
14 is the entrance behind and the exit, and this bullet 
15 went through a bone in the forearm. The ulnar bone, 
16 the two bones in the arm, the radius and ulnar. The 
17 ulnar is kind of underneath the pinky and the radius 
18 is on the other side. 
19 This went through the radius, the 
20 x-rays that show little fragments of metal and the 
21 fracture of the radius bone. Partly, that's why 
22 there's such a big exit wound, it is wobbling and it 
23 had destroyed some bone. 
24 But this is the entrance and this is 
25 the exit and this is from behind. Now it went from

2 Now, it could be standing at 
3 attention, going back and front, could be arms up, 
4 could be arms way up, would have the same thing. It 
5 could be if the arm is in front, since the arm is 
6 mobile, if I put my arm like this, it could come in 
7 the back of the arm and come out the front. And in 
8 that situation it would have to reenter into the 
9 body, which we don't see, which we don't see. 
10 
11 
Q Why do you see that as controversial? 
A Well, as to whether he was shot, people 
12 say from the back, no injuries to the back, but I 
13 interpret that as being from behind. 
14 Q Right. 
15 A I know there's some controversy as to 
16 whether or not he was shot while his back was to the 
17 officer. 
18 Q That's a question that we have. 
19 A Yeah. 
20 Q Does this support that? 
21 A This would support from being shot from 
22 behind. It didn't hit his back, but from behind. 
23 There are other ways if this arm could be moved in 
24 other directions, you can twist your arm around and 
25 that has to be taken into account, but there isn't

1 any kind of mark, bullet wound on the chest that 
2 would support that. And so much of it becomes, 
3 which eyewitnesses are better and that's, that 
4 doesn't come with medical school. 
5 Q I guess within the bowels of reasonable 
6 medical certainty or in your opinion, you're saying 
7 that this injury to this forearm could have occurred 
8 with his hand up? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Or with him running and someone shooting 
11 him from behind, or not running, someone shooting 
12 him from behind? 
13 A I'm saying at the time of the shooting the 
14 gun was pointed at the back of his arm, that's all. 
15 Where his arm was depends on what other information 
16 you have.

18 A This is from behind from a forensic point 
19 of view. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Any questions?

23 gun was positioned, the trajectory of the bullet,

25 the limb?

You're right, at the moment of fire. 
Okay. 
3 A A limb can go through, within a second, go 
4 like this. All I can say is at the instant of 
5 firing it is almost an instant it could go through, 
6 the bullet, the muzzle was pointing at the back.

If he was positioned this way to the gun. 
Exactly. If the police are 
3 here and I shoot, that don't mean that he shoot from 
4 the back. 
5 A That could be from the side, but then you 
6 see once that bullet comes out, it would strike 
7 something if it is there. If it is this way. 
8 He's running and he's doing 
9 this with his hand, you move the arm when you run 
10 and the police was right there, it could strike here

MS. WHIRLEY: So we're back on the record. 
(By Ms. Whirley) So, Doctor, tell us how 
7 many wounds have we gone through so far? You 
8 thought six to seven. 
9 A I think we're gone through eight wounds 
10 and seven bullets tracks. 
11 Q Okay, all right. And tracking, when you 
12 say bullet tracks, when you say tracking, what did 
13 that mean, first of all? 
14 A Examining injuries to the body caused by 
15 bullets. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A Even though some of these injuries are 
18 less important than others. 
19 Q Are you able to tell like where the 
20 shooter was in relation to the person that shot by 
21 looking at wounds? 
22 A In my opinion of the seven bullets that 
23 struck Mr. Brown, five came from in front of him, 
24 the one in the biceps can't tell, the one that, of 
25 the seven bullets that struck, one was in the hand,

1 which I think based on the, my review of the 
2 histology and all, came while his hand was in the 
3 car. 
4 One came through the upper arm biceps 
5 graze wound, can't tell which direction. And one 
6 came from behind the right forearm, which could have 
7 come from behind, the others were from in front of 
8 him, the weapon was pointed at his front at the time 
9 of discharge. 
10 
11 
Q Okay. Any questions on any of that? 
We'll look at another. This came out 
12 of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 7, photograph is Number 
13 6. And let's see, which way, Doctor, the other way? 
14 A Yes, the head by three o'clock, thank you. 
15 The reason I'm showing this, I did examine his 
16 clothing yesterday at the police building and was 
17 impressed, which I haven't realized it that there 
18 were drops of blood that had come from drippings 
19 from above. And there was some on the socks, which 
20 you can see closer if you look at the socks, drops 
21 of the socks. 
22 There had to be a time, from the time 
23 that Mr. Brown was injured and bleeding until he 
24 collapsed where the blood was coming from above. 
25 And the only place I could figure out it came from

1 was the hand. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 72 
2 So that after he takes his hand from 
3 the car, he is dripping blood that goes, there's 
4 also some on the shirt, but that has a lot of blood 
5 that developed after he was on the ground because 
6 the body kept oozing blood while he's laying face 
7 down after he's dead. And so there's a lot of blood 
8 that occurred after he died, but these drops of 
9 blood all came while he was alive and to me had some 
10 significance about this occurring while he was going 
11 away from the car. 
12 I can't tell from this how far away 
13 from the car he was, but he did not leave that car 
14 without realizing that he had suffered an injury to 
15 the hand. Whatever psychological effect that has on 
16 people, he knew he was bleeding, he knew he had a 
17 gunshot wound to the hand. 
18 And the skin on the car matches 
19 coming from here. So that I think that, whoever 
20 examined the car, they did a very fine job to find a 
21 piece of tissue on the car because it had already 
22 dried and all, when he takes the hand out of the car 
23 after it's injured, it goes against, it leans 
24 against the car, wherever that was taken from, I 
25 don't know which part of the outside it was and then

1 he continued in a way that depends on eyewitnesses 
2 and all. 
3 Q In your review of all the information to 
4 come up with conclusions, did you determine whether 
5 or not Michael Brown was right or left handed? 
6 A No, I didn't determine that from the 
7 autopsy. 
8 Q Did you determine it from any other 
9 source? 
10 A I think I was told he was right handed, 
11 I'm not sure. 85 percent of people are 
12 right-handed, but I don't know, I didn't determine. 
13 Q Okay. And if, as you described the wound 
14 to the hand as occurring in close range, not 
15 contact, but close range while his hand was inside 
16 of the car. And it would have bled quite a bit, 
17 would we, should we expect to see a lot of bleeding 
18 in the car? 
19 A I would expect that there would be blood 
20 in the car, plus blood on the weapon, you know, that 
21 drops of blood came out and blood along the trail, 
22 blood drops coming down don't only land on the 
23 socks, they would land on the ground and it would 
24 depend on how carefully the scene was examined to 
25 look for a blood trail, especially in hot weather.

1 One of the things about hot weather 
2 it does things to blood and all on the ground that 
3 makes it harder to identify. And that kind of a 
4 trail can be helpful in determining how far he went. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
But you know that from the position of the 
7 body, I don't know the distance, I've heard all kind 
8 of distances. 
9 Q But it would be your opinion that the 
10 majority of the bleeding that would have occurred 
11 before he fell to the ground came from the hand? 
12 A Yes, there was no other place that he 
13 would be bleeding from. Once he goes down on the 
14 ground, he's bleeding from the head and from the 
15 chest and that would accumulate with time. So 
16 that's why we see a lot of it on clothing on the 
17 upper shirt. But that happened after he collapses. 
18 Q So when he's shot, let's kind of go 
19 through it. He's shot, there's a gunshot wound to 
20 the hand, there's a gunshot wound to the forearm? 
21 
22

1 A The three of them happen in rapid 
2 succession and certainly he would lose consciousness 
3 on the top of the head. 
4 Q All three of those are in the head region;

Q 
A 
Okay. So those are the three? 
Yeah, because they lineup pretty good if 
10 there was somebody shooting rapidly. 
11 Q Okay. My question to you is twofold, one 
12 is, once he received the shots, all the shots that 
13 you examine except for the head shot, and maybe it 
14 cannot be separated, I don't know. Would he still 
15 have been mobile? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q On his feet and able to run or charge at 
18 an object? 
19 A I think that certainly the arm shots, the 
20 arm shots would not prevent him from being mobile 
21 and running front or back or whatever. And the one 
22 in the lower chest wouldn't necessarily slow him 
23 down, but the one in the eye, you know, that goes 
24 through his right eyeball would, could make him lose 
25 consciousness because it does have lines of force

1 going through the brain tissue and all, but not 
2 necessarily. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A So he could have been, now whether he 
5 could be running or, you know, or walking or 
6 whatever, would vary from person to person. In 
7 fact, some people if they're shot once in the arm 
8 might faint, I guess he wasn't the fainting kind. 
9 So how people react to gunshot wounds 
10 is a different thing, but from the anatomy point of 
11 view, he would have been able to be conscious and 
12 theoretically, but for the bullet wound in the head, 
13 could have been treated and survived if he went 
14 right to a hospital or something. 
15 Q And the wounds that are around the right, 
16 you said there was one to the chest area, correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you don't think he would have been 
19 bleeding much from those wounds? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Well --
Before he collapsed? 
He would be bleeding internally, but not 
23 outside because bleeding usually, internal organs 
24 are injured internally and then they will spill 
25 outside. When he collapses, the blood will start

3 No, that was the question 
4 that I had because I was wondering, I said why, I 
5 mean, this is a big guy, I'm quite sure the volume 
6 of blood in his 
7 A Is more than normal. 
8 I know when I went to the 
9 doctor to get a flu shot, she stuck me and I didn't 
10 bleed. She said you have good elasticity in your 
11 skin and I thought maybe that's why he's not 
12 bleeding. 
13 A That's true. We see this a lot with knife 
14 wounds, even in the heart. The knife goes in and 
15 goes out and most people, the skin and fat tissue 
16 will immediately close up, you know, there isn't a 
17 hole left. It is a slow process for bleeding to 
18 occur through the body. 
19 Superficial cuts on the hand bleed 
20 very much, and this is sort of a superficial cut 
21 because there's no skin there to come together from 
22 elasticity, so that's why cut wounds bleed more than 
23 bullet wounds because the bullet goes in and the 
24 skin elasticity and the outer most tissue underneath 
25 it close it up.

1 So when he is shot in the front, the 
2 blood doesn't start to come out right away. It 
3 could in a few minutes, but he collapses to the 
4 ground. And you can see in the head, there wasn't 
5 blood matting the hair, although there was bleeding 
6 that came out. 
7 I can see in the scene photograph 
8 there was some blood coming out gradually from the 
9 top of the head, but it went downward and didn't mat 
10 the hair up. It wasn't a massive amount, it was a 
11 small amount. 
12 So that I think that in the normal 
13 course you get very little blood coming out if a 
14 person collapses right away before death occurred in 
15 this case, because of that final shot.

1 shot, if you are? 
2 A A very topical question. Yeah, marijuana 
3 is not a drug, it is a group of about 18 different 
4 chemicals. So that it isn't like taking a 
5 barbiturate or cyanide, which is just one chemical, 
6 marijuana has all kind of different chemicals where 
7 it is grown, the fertilizer, the water supply. The 
8 one that is most active is the Delta-9, 
9 tetrahydrocannabinol, THC. He had some of that in 
10 his blood. And that could affect, could have 
11 affected him, however, it is a relative small amount 
12 and how it affects somebody varies. 
13 Some people can have hallucinations 
14 with a lot of marijuana, other people just go to 
15 sleep. During the '30s, 1930s, there was terror of 
16 marijuana that it made everybody go crazy, it 
17 doesn't make people go crazy. That's why the laws 
18 have been so strict on it, but now it is coming into 
19 more legal status in some places. 
20 Marijuana is kind of unpredictable, 
21 some people can take marijuana and do funny things 
22 and other people are just perfectly normal with it. 
23 The problem, marijuana from the 
24 toxicology point of view, marijuana gets into the 
25 soft tissues and fatty tissues in the body. So even

1 though I smoked a joint two days ago, I might still 
2 have little bits coming out today into the 
3 bloodstream, or even studies have done for three or 
4 four weeks as it's released from the fat. 
5 So the amount of marijuana he has 
6 could cause abnormal behavior, but usually doesn't. 
7 The best indicator of that would be what his 
8 behavior was in the time period before and I try to 
9 look at that and you see the incident with the 
10 cigars, where he took the cigars or the little 
11 cigars. Would that in any way be affected by 
12 marijuana I think is a guess. Was he walking the 
13 street because of marijuana? That isn't usually 
14 what happens with marijuana, but it could be and it 
15 is too variable. 
16 If all of us smoked the same amount 
17 of marijuana, we would all act differently. Most of 
18 us would just feel very nice about it, somebody 
19 might not feel very bad about it and some people may 
20 go to sleep and somebody might do something that he 
21 wouldn't normally do, but that's, but it was 
22 present, but he did take it within a day or two.

1 He indicated in his 
2 testimony that the amount of Delta 9-THC that he had 
3 in his blood compared to the way it is broken down, 
4 not just in the urine, but in the blood was not 
5 consistent with just a little bit of an amount. He 
6 indicated that given, if you look at the whole 
7 picture and not just the 12 nanograms and when it 
8 was done, that it would indicate that it was a 
9 larger amount than just a little bit amount of 
10 marijuana, would you agree with that? 
11 A Well, it is definitely evidence of smoking 
12 marijuana. The problem is whether it is 12 or five 
13 or 20, it affects people differently and a lot of it 
14 has to do with how, what do you call it, how used to 
15 it, how often a person has taken it before. If you 
16 take it more often, it has less of an unpredictable 
17 affect. 
18 It could have been a factor in his 
19 behavior, but the best measure of his behavior is 
20 what he was doing all day. Was he acting different 
21 than he usually did, for example, and that would be 
22 for friends and relatives or witnesses who saw him 
23 during the day. Was shoplifting cigars a great 
24 departure from his usual behavior. 
25 So great of a departure that one

1 could say he was influenced by the marijuana or did 
2 he do that sometimes when he didn't have marijuana. 
3 It is interesting that no other drugs 
4 were found and no other medications were found. 
5 couldn't find if he had been taking any other 
6 medications that he had stopped taking. 
I 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Why is that interesting to 
8 you? 
9 A Because if he was supposedly taking some 
10 medications for weight or for emotional disturbance 
11 or for sleep or so, and under a medical directive we 
12 should see it in his bloodstream. With the 
13 toxicology and the toxicology can tell us if 
14 somebody is taking drugs you are not supposed to 
15 take, like marijuana, or some they didn't take drugs 
16 that they should have taken. 
17 Suppose somebody is on antipsychotic 
18 medication and there is none in his toxicology, that 
19 would indicate he wasn't taking his medication, that 
20 could be a reason for his behavior. 
21 So toxicology, everything it has and 
22 everything it doesn't have has significance, and in 
23 this instance, I think marijuana is significant that 
24 he smoked marijuana, but 99 out of 100 people taking 
25 marijuana aren't going to get in a fight with a

15 people out of 100 wouldn't attack a police officer, 
16 what's that based on? 
17 A Based on 20 years I worked with drug 
18 addicts, on the board of directors of a number of 
19 drug and alcohol programs in New York City. While 
20 25 years I was in New York City as medical examiner, 
21 deputy medical examiner and then chief medical 
22 examiner, we did lots of autopsies on drug users, 
23 because we got a lot of autopsy findings in that 
24 regard. I was on the board of directors and worked 
25 closely interviewing and treating drug addicts,

1 mostly heroin addicts and alcoholics, in different 
2 communities. 
3 And all of them there was an issue 
4 about marijuana because even back 20 years ago, is 
5 marijuana the gateway drug to further and more 
6 severe drug abuse, which was the general feeling as 
7 far as the federal laws went. 
8 And one of the things in talking to 
9 drug addicts and working with drug addicts, I found 
10 that marijuana did not play a significant role in 
11 their behavior except for one fact, and one fact is 
12 the significant fact was because it is illegal, the 
13 person in contact with the seller was also in 
14 contact with people who sold other drugs. They were 
15 more vulnerable to heroin, barbiturates and other 
16 things not because of their behavior, because they 
17 were in contact with people who sell illegal drugs 
18 and made them more vulnerable to it. 
19 So in my opinion working with addicts 
20 clinically, as well as autopsy findings, I think 
21 that marijuana is not any worse than alcohol. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: To clarify, Doctor, you're 
23 testifying as to an expert opinion today, are you 
24 testifying today that you have been qualified in a 
25 court of law as an expert in toxicology?

1 A Not as an expert in toxicology, the common 
2 way I'm qualified is an expert interpreting what the 
3 alcohol level means. Half the cases we do involve 
4 alcohol, either the unnatural deaths and homicides 
5 and often we're asked to interpret the, not to do 
6 it, I'm not a toxicologist, absolutely, I'm not an 
7 expert in toxicology, but I think all forensic 
8 pathologists have to be experts in interpreting 
9 drugs in the body. Is it enough to cause death. 
10 An example, we do an autopsy and the 
11 result can come back high level of barbiturates or 
12 no barbiturates and yet from the history of the 
13 autopsy we determined he died by a barbiturate 
14 overdose. The toxicologist would say how can you 
15 diagnose a barbiturate overdose. Because we do the 
16 autopsy, we see that over the five days he was in 
17 the hospital, the barbiturate overdose that brought 
18 him there got metabolize. By the time he dies, he 
19 has no barbiturates in his body, even though the 
20 cause of death is a barbiturate overdose. 
21 There is a difference between what 
22 the toxicologist is an expert in finding the 
23 marijuana, absolutely, I don't do those tests at 
24 all.

1 experts in how drugs affects the behavior or how 
2 drugs affect the human body? 
3 A Yes, that's how the drugs affects the body 
4 is a medical knowledge, not a toxicologist. And the 
5 reason I'm a forensic pathologist, certainly in New 
6 York get qualified to talk about that is because the 
7 judge decides hey, you're an expert in finding that 
8 it is a .02 or .5 or .3 alcohol, but we're going to 
9 have the doctor interpret what that means. 
10 And I think a pharmacologist is a 
11 little different, a pharmacologist gets more into 
12 the affects of the body, but toxicologists are 
13 trained in chemistry. And the smart ones get to 
14 know about the affects on the body, but not from

14 experience, I've written books about drug abuse, 
15 drug abuse in general beyond from my experience with 
16 heroin addicts and alcoholics in treatment programs 
17 and I'm just, I just think that if somebody on 
18 ectasy or was having hallucinations on LSD might 
19 fight with a police officer. Somebody on heroin 
20 would go to sleep before fighting with a police 
21 officer, somebody on marijuana, I haven't, it

10 that was being brought up is that, you are better at 
11 me in this, what were people saying, how was he 
12 acting before this episode would be a better 
13 indication of affects of marijuana because marijuana 
14 doesn't let you spend the day doing what you always 
15 do and then suddenly pop off and do something very 
16 different. 
17 If you are on marijuana and you are 
18 going to act out, you do it right away while it is 
19 at its peak. Then they can do things, but that 
20 would be my experience.

1 started the testimony today, you said the Brown 
2 family attorney reached out to you, what did they 
3 specially ask you to do or in what role did they ask 
4 you to take? 
5 A Yeah, the person who reached out was the

7 specifically remember this because it is not 
8 surprising in some way. That the mother and the 
9 father, it's now been a week, they don't know why 
10 their son died and they had other questions. And 
11 they're concerned that they might not, they have 
12 been told it might be weeks or months before they 
13 are given any information while it is being 
14 completed. 
15 So they wanted an autopsy largely to 
16 find out what, why the son died except besides 
17 reading speculations in newspapers. And also I find 
18 out when I sat down with the family, I came, I sat 
19 down with them first, what all families do they want 
20 to know, did my son suffer, you know. Did he die 
21 right away, and that was the issue. 
22 The issue wasn't did he get shot by

24 issue was what happened, how many times was he shot,

9 times for an autopsy findings to be kept, not made 
10 public initially while an investigation is still 
11 ongoing, would you agree that there is a, might be a 
12 need or a reason that investigators might not want 
13 to disclose that type of information? 
14 A Yes. It might be valid or not. As a 
15 medical examiner, see we are put in the middle, 
16 medical examiners should be an independent 
17 scientist. 
18 Dealing with patients, our concern is 
19 when we do autopsies, we are doing for the family 
20 and for the society in general, we always have to 
21 relate to the family. I spent a few years in 
22 internal medicine before going into pathology and 
23 that's what's important. 
24 So I have found in New York that many 
25 times when there have been encounters with

1 correction officers in jail, we had riots in jails 
2 and encounters with police, that the sooner you're 
3 able to tell the family what happened, remember we 
4 do an autopsy and 95 percent of the information is 
5 obtained within the day of the autopsy. We then 
6 wait for the toxicology, histology, which is usually 
7 not necessary legally. 
8 Somebody shoots somebody or gets in a 
9 car accident and is drunk, we'll call that a 
10 homicide, for example, a homicide. They wait on the 
11 autopsy report that we don't, that we don't wait for 
12 everything to come through. Even though that every 
13 shooting, every homicide there is a toxicology on, 
14 but if somebody was shot yesterday, they'll come out 
15 tomorrow and tell you what the cause of death is 
16 even though everything is not completed. 
17 So just from my experience as a chief 
18 medical examiner is that the sooner that this 
19 information is given out, it calms everybody down 
20 because one of the things I saw happening with the 
21 family here and many other families, whenever 
22 somebody dies in an encounter with the police, they 
23 immediately often don't trust the police. And then 
24 if the medical examiner doesn't release the finding 
25 right away they feel, as happened here, that the

Page 94 
1 medical examiner is covering up for the police, and 
2 that has to be dealt with. As a physician, I have 
3 to deal with that with the family. 
4 Now, sometimes it's a value to not 
5 release information because you are going to get 
6 information, you don't want people to know what 
7 happened and you don't want people to make up 
8 stories. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: For example, I saw the 
10 police officer stand over Michael Brown's body and 
11 shoot him in the back, in the head as he laid face 
12 down in the pavement, that couldn't possibly have 
13 happened based upon your findings, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: So wouldn't it be important 
16 that maybe those findings would be withheld from the 
17 general public so that witnesses who may come 
18 forward and report having witnessed this incident, 
19 the police may be able to determine the veracity or 
20 credibility of that witness if they report something 
21 that we know the findings do not support. 
22 A Yeah, that can happen. However, see in 
23 the old days the way we did things was the mantra is 
24 you got to find, interview all the witnesses, knock 
25 on doors, telephones, whatever in the first 48

1 hours. And you got to get all the stories locked 
2 down in the 48 hours and that was the police mantra, 
3 or shoe leather. 
4 Now oftentimes we're going to wait a 
5 little bit until all the DNA and the other tests 
6 come through before we interview people during the 
7 time they can also make up stories. 
8 In answer to your question, I think 
9 that if the procedure is to interview people right 
10 away, and then the autopsy findings can be released 
11 within two or three days after that, it covers both 
12 bases. I just think in my experience with families, 
13 that the transparency in situations where families 
14 don't trust what's going on. 
15 When we have seen riot situations in 
16 New York City, in Harlem, or specific ones, I'm 
17 thinking about the fact that we said yes, the death 
18 of the innocent person was caused by a police bullet 
19 and not by one of the snipers. Immediately calms 
20 things down. They are going to continue, they know 
21 we're not going to cover it. I don't know, that's 
22 my feeling as a physician. 
23 : I'm trying to stay on topic. 
24 I have a question for you and I know we have a time 
25 crunch as well. In regards to, we have been here

1 quite awhile already, my question is going back to 
2 the question I just asked you. You kind of 
3 explained why the family reached out to you. 
4 A Yes. 
5 So it seems to me when they 
6 reached out to you, you started an investigation of 
7 your own, would you say that's truthful? 
8 A Yes, within my expertise. 
9 Sure. In addition to your 
10 role as a forensic pathologist to examine the body, 
11 you began investigating on your own; is that 
12 correct? 
13 A Well, that was primarily what I did was 
14 examine the body and they asked certain questions 
15 about his death. 
16 So how did you do that 
17 investigation, outside of examining the physical 
18 body, how did you investigate? 
19 A That's my investigation is examining the 
20 body and finding out from the family what kind of 
21 medical problems the person may have had and any 
22 history that would be pertinent to interpret the 
23 autopsy findings, but it was essentially doing the 
24 autopsy.

I didn't get the autopsy until yesterday

13 An autopsy was leaked, it looked pretty good. I 
14 couldn't rely on it until I saw it yesterday when it 
15 was given to me by the medical examiner's office. 
16 You viewed this leaked 
17 autopsy report prior to your autopsy of the body? 
18 A No, no, there was no autopsy. I spoke to 
19 , the chief medical examiner, who I have 
20 known for quite a while, and been told I was doing 
21 it. We invited anybody from the office to come down 
22 to see. I think it is always better if the person 
23 that does the first autopsy is also present at the 
24 second autopsy to make sure everybody is on the same

2 I was hoping to speak with her about 
3 the results of the first autopsy when she got 
4 authorization from the prosecutor's office, we 
5 didn't have that conversation. 
6 I'm sorry, I don't think my 
7 question was answered, I can rephrase it. Did you 
8 view the leaked autopsy prior to conducting your 
9 autopsy? 
10 A I thought I answered it. There was no 
11 leaked autopsy until a couple weeks ago. There was 
12 no autopsy, I didn't review any autopsy findings 
13 prior to my autopsy and the autopsy leaking I'm 
14 talking about was from two or three weeks ago. 
15 Sure. So you said you got 
16 things off the internet? 
17 A I got the leaked autopsy on the internet. 
18 Okay. So you never searched 
19 the internet for any other information? 
20 
21 
A No. 
You provided us a lot of 
22 information today then, I don't believe someone 
23 could just evaluate based on looking at a body. You 
24 made assumptions that his hand was in the car, I 
25 don't know how you would have known there was a car

1 unless you are just looking at the body --
A I read the newspaper. 2 
3 Let me finish. You said 
4 there were drops of blood on his hands and socks 
5 that had to have come from his hand. You said that 
6 you knew he knew he was bleeding, Michael Brown, 
7 when he left the car. You said you've heard all 
8 kind of distances that the shooting occurred, you 
9 said that he, Michael Brown, could have been treated 
10 and survived if he received immediate medical 
11 attention. 
12 I mean, these are all things that seem to 
13 me to be assumptions or things that you've gathered 
14 from either talking to other individuals or looking 
15 on the internet and doesn't to me seem factual or 
16 based on your role as a forensic pathologist. 
17 A An autopsy can never be evaluated in a 
18 vacuum, we always have to have other information 
19 that we get from various sources. Somebody falling 
20 out of a window will have the same injuries, whether 
21 he was pushed, whether he jumped and committed 
22 suicide or whether he fell accidently. No autopsy 
23 can interpret all by itself because all kind of

1 received initially was what the lawyers had told me 
2 and what I read in the New York Times about, you 
3 know, rioting in Ferguson. I don't get stuff off 
4 the internet. I got the autopsy report, which is 
5 just three weeks ago or something, but I think it is 
6 unreliable, I agree with you, until you get an 
7 official one. 
8 I read about the disputes that were 
9 going on. I read about how there was a leak about 
10 the FBI reporting that there was Brown's blood DNA 
11 in the car. I could say that that injury to the 
12 hand was consistent with that, that's all, not that 
13 it happened that way, but other people are doing 
14 other investigations in their expertise. 
15 Any autopsy report, hospital, medical 
16 examiner, forensic has to include lots of other 
17 information, some of which are gotten from police, 
18 some from lawyers, some from family. None of which 
19 can automatically be adopted as true just to see how 
20 it correlates with the autopsy report. 
21 I just asked, you know,

1 or in a newspaper, we are here for the truth. 
2 A I'm not, I'm not, what you call it, 
3 relying on the internet. The reason I mention the 
4 internet is because when the autopsy report was, 
5 we've been waiting, the family has been waiting for 
6 the autopsy report and finally there was an 
7 announcement that the autopsy report had been 
8 released. And talked with the lawyer and said it 
9 wasn't released in the normal course, it was what he 
10 called leaked through the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
11 He sent it to me and I read it, you 
12 know, it looked good but it's still, as you said, 
13 I'm not going to rely on it as being the true thing 
14 unless I knew it was the true thing. And there were 
15 other things you mention that the clothing, for 
16 example, I saw the clothing. I examined the 
17 clothing, and the drops of blood on the clothing and 
18 sometimes we can find droplets of blood to be very 
19 useful in our examination and it showed that it was 
20 coming from above the pants and down to the floor 
21 and that the only thing I could find that would go 
22 along with it would be the cut in the hand.

3 actions were and how he was behaving in the hours 
4 before this episode is the best indicator of the 
5 affects of marijuana than what I'm raising, you 
6 know, in different forms. But I just think that 
7 medical examiners always have to take other things 
8 into consideration. 
9 And the best example of that, the 
10 biggest obligation we have is to issue a death 
11 certificate. And the medical examiner, coroner's 
12 job that he's responsible for, he or she has to 
13 certify the name of the person through various 
14 means, make sure it is the right person on the death 
15 certificate. 
16 Cause of death and manner of death. 
17 Cause of death we find from the 
18 findings at autopsy, gunshot wounds, heart attack, 
19 cancer. The manner of death, natural, accident or 
20 suicide, we are always relying on other people's 
21 information. 
22 Falling out of the window, was he 
23 washing the window at that time depends on some 
24 other information that may or may not be reliable.

3 injury to the hand in the car, yes. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So, I mean, you really 
5 can't conclude anything from the fact that other 
6 than the blood that was on his shorts and socks came 
7 from the body of Michael Brown and that they came 
8 after he had been injured by a gunshot wound. 
9 Injured with a gun, is that fair to say? 
10 A I think I agree with everything you say. 
11 I think also that the only way I could correlate it 
12 if it came from the hand, but that would be my 
13 opinion. It could come from any part of his body 
14 that was bleeding long enough for that blood to come 
15 out, yes, I agree with you.

17 that say when I saw him get shot they saw blood

2 cause all of the blood, it could cause some of the

4 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Go ahead. 
5 You did say that the hand 
6 wound, I guess because of the way it is superficial 
7 or the way the bullet would have hit it, it would 
8 have bled more? 
A Yes. 9 
10 
11 
Compared to the --
A To the bullet hole, yes. I think the 
12 issue that somebody brought up was even bullet holes 
13 quickly, the elasticity quickly closes up for a 
14 little bit, so you get some blood. You see it in a 
15 rapid camera that some blood comes out, not as much 
16 that comes out of the cut surface of the hand. 
17 Bullet wounds in the hand is, this one is like a cut 
18 wound, it didn't go in and seal up, it is a long 
19 graze so that a lot of blood vessels were exposed in 
20 the hand and caused bleeding. 
21 I have a question, I'm kind 
22 of curious about the original autopsy, so you did 
23 get a chance to see it?

2 Did you ever see the report? 
3 A Then I saw recently the report, the 
4 autopsy report, yes. 
5 So how did the one that you 
6 said that was leaked, how did it compare to the 
7 original one that you saw. 
8 A It was the same, it was the same. The 
9 leaked autopsy report was the same as the final one, 
10 but as was brought up, it is not as reliable. 
11 Sometimes things get leaked and changes are made, 
12 but in this instance the leaked autopsy was the same 
13 as the official autopsy. 
14 I have two questions. We 
15 have heard testimony from two different agencies 
16 that have performed autopsies. We had St. Louis 
17 County and the Department of Justice or the 
18 Department of Defense. They both come in and go 
19 over their autopsies in great detail and their 
20 findings. Is there any reason that we should 
21 question the validity of those, of those findings? 
22 A Well, I think, I'm not sure. I know what 
23 I seen in the autopsy report from St. Louis County. 
24 I haven't seen anything about the federal autopsy 
25 report.

As far as I could see with the St. 
Louis County autopsy, the findings are the same. 
3 is the interpretation we get into that can differ 
4 depending on experience and other things. 
5 For example, whether or not the 
6 bullet wound in the clavicle or up by the shoulder 
7 by the collar bone is a reentry or not. As a 
It 
8 forensic, we can disagree forensically, doesn't make 
9 any difference in the scheme of things, except it 
10 ads a bullet that struck the body. 
11 So from my experience, I would 
12 interpret it as a reentry wound rather than an entry 
13 wound, but it really doesn't make any difference in 
14 the overall interpretation of what happened. 
15 I don't know if, I think as far as 
16 the toxicology goes, I think the issue that was 
17 brought up by the attorney was that there are 
18 toxicologists who are very good at finding 
19 toxicology, and an interpretation of how long the 
20 drugs last in the body. They are very good how long 
21 the drugs lasted in the body, for example. And that 
22 would have, uh, what do you call it, many more 
23 importance than a medical examiner's interpretation, 
24 but I think that the point you are in a position to 
25 do much more than we can is finding out his behavior

2 If marijuana has caused his behavior 
3 to be different than usual, that can best be 
4 determined by other observations by people that 
5 you've taken testimony from during the day and

7 bizarre it would be very quickly. 
8 You know, if I'm normal behavior for 
9 the next four hours, I'm not suddenly going to do 
10 something to act differently when the level of 
11 marijuana has gone down considerably, that's all. 
12 My second question is, we 
13 can agree you're a pretty high profile person, and 
14 you've been in the news and on the news and 
15 interviewed a lot, do you recall a conversation that 
16 you had with when you mentioned 
17 to her that the presence of marijuana in Michael 
18 Brown could have led him to act crazy was the actual 
19 word that you used? 
20 A I did say that, yes, it can, but it is 
21 unlikely. And the sentence we are talking about it 
22 would be right away and it is unusual, but it can in 
23 the whole spectrum. Most people wouldn't have too 
24 much affect on, some would have a very soothing

2 cancer and things like that, and some people can act 
3 very unusual and crazy, but that's very unusual. 
4 But I think you got it right. 
5 Thank you. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else? 
7 You know we have a copy of 
8 the Department of Defense and we have a copy of St. 
9 Louis County. I'm still baffled by what you see, I 
10 don't have anything that shows me in writing so we 
11 can compare what, what your findings are. So what 
12 are the differences? 
13 A Well, number one --
14 I mean, we are already after 
15 12. 
16 A That's okay. I know number one, that I'm 
17 giving you an opinion in great part depends on what 
18 I saw yesterday. I couldn't give an opinion, as I 
19 said a long time ago, until I saw the autopsy 
20 photographs, what the body looked like before the 
21 autopsy was done, you know, which these photographs 
22 that you see are all from that time, which are very 
23 significant. 
24 I couldn't see the x-rays, the 
25 clothing, were all important to me in arriving at

1 particular opinions. 
2 As far as the autopsy, and then I 
3 will now write a report, but I couldn't write it 
4 yesterday, I will write a report on the basis of my 
5 finding. 
6 As far as I could see from the St. 
7 Louis report, I don't know the other report, we 
8 agree with everything except that reentry wound. 
9 You agree with everything 
10 except the reentry? 
11 A In the autopsy report is there, I don't 
12 know what the testimony has been, but is there 
13 something particular that you think --
14 No, and that is my question. 
15 My question is, you have made statements to the 
16 press about how your findings are different than 
17 ours and now--
A I have not made such statement. 18 
19 
20 
So the press is wrong? 
A Of course. I am told one thing, I'm told 
21 that the USA Today had an article about me. I have 
22 no idea what it said, but I find often, especially 
23 in forensic, that what they say they often 
24 misconstrue things. 
25 I know.

1 A So if you are referring to articles I 
2 haven't seen, I can't answer that. I'm telling you 
3 that the only thing I said to the press was 
4 initially, way at the very first day, I did the 
5 autopsy and the next day the family had a press 
6 conference. And I said as a basis of my findings, I 
7 find no evidence of powder on any of the gunshot 
8 wounds and that they were all distant, beyond one or 
9 two feet away at the time of discharge. 
10 Now, yesterday, I looked at slides, I 
11 looked at things and sure enough, I looked at 
12 pictures that one photo shows it nicely to me of the 
13 hand that there is powder and I indicated at the 
14 time you recall very careful to say that, these are 
15 preliminary, these are not my final opinions. And 
16 if I get more information, and essentially I didn't 
17 get that much information until yesterday, when I 
18 went through the thing, but I would think that yes, 
19 I was mistaken. There is powder, gunshot powder on 
20 the hand. 
21 But, and I think that the only thing 
22 that's different was whether we both agree that 
23 there was a gunshot wound in the back, one was in 
24 the back, the others were in the front, there is no 
25 difference.

1 The reason I ask that is 
2 because you did mention you got some of your 
3 information from the New York Times. I just wanted 
4 to point out for the record the information that we 
5 do get from the media can be skewed. There is very 
6 little that's correct about it. So I just wanted to 
7 make sure that you know. 
8 A You're absolutely right, but the 
9 information I get you see is different kind of 
10 information is a lot of turmoil in Ferguson, there 
11 are people making all kind of charges. That there's 
12 a problem with the interpretation, that's the 
13 information that I get. 
14 I don't get, I did say that if, in my 
15 opinion, if the leaked report that there's blood 
16 from Brown in the car, then that would be good 
17 evidence that his hand was in the car. Then that 
18 would be good evidence at the time he was bleeding, 
19 that kind of thing, if. But all the ifs canceled 
20 out when I see what the work was. I agree with you, 
21 what's in the newspapers are not reliable. 
22 Malarkey. 
23 A They are not reliable for forensic work 
24 and the news media, if you haven't figured out, like 
25 to create problems. It isn't to say A, B and C,

1 everybody says A, Band C, that's not news. But to 
2 say he says A and he says Z, that sells newspapers. 
3 One other question and then 
4 I promise no more. Do you do every autopsy you are 
5 asked to perform for a family? 
6 A No, no. 
7 So what's the determining 
8 factor. 
9 A The most important factor is will the 
10 autopsy make a difference. Is it important, is it 
11 important, because often families want autopsies out 
12 of curiosity and that may be okay, but I wouldn't go 
13 out of the way to do such an option. I do about, I 
14 do many less, I'm asked to do lots of autopsies and 
15 I will do the autopsy where I think that an autopsy 
16 or re-autopsy would be significant for the family or 
17 for the society. 
18 When we do autopsies on homicides, we 
19 have two things, one is the family and two is 
20 society. Society has a right to know what happened 
21 to somebody who's murdered and how to prevent it or 
22 catch the bad guy to do it. So that we have both of 
23 those and sometimes that comes into conflict as the 
24 prosecutor said that sometimes telling the family, 
25 which is important, comes in contact with the

1 investigation from the public as far as giving 
2 information out to the bad guy to make up stories or 
3 something. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Just for the record, and 
5 this is it, it is not really a question. You had 
6 mentioned that there was one shot from the back and 
7 I didn't want it to be misconstrued that you were 
8 saying he was shot in the back, you are talking 
9 about you talk the forearm.

Back of the right forearm, yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, all right. 
Can I just mention that, as I say, this 
13 isn't my first rodeo in Missouri, I've been here 
14 before, I've investigated, I just recently, a year 
15 or two ago, talked to the St. Louis Major Crime 
16 Unit, which works with Illinois, nearby Illinois. 
17 spent a lot of time in Columbia, Missouri 
18 investigating unexplained deaths in the Harris S. 
19 Truman Veterans Hospital, I've been involved with a 
20 number of investigations in veteran hospitals where 
21 medical personnel may have intentionally killed 
22 patients. 
23 And I've lectured to the Missouri 
24 Highway Patrol and things like that. We always, 
25 medical examiners are coming to some jurisdictions,

1 always work under the guise of being carpetbaggers, 
2 and to a certain extent we are carpetbaggers coming 
3 from away, but I've been accepted in other 
4 situations as reasonable in Missouri. 
5 So I hope what I may have may have 
6 sounded unreasonable isn't as nutty as it might 
7 sound. It is just after 50 years in this business, 
8 one isn't afraid to give opinions. 
9 I'd like to know if you 
10 know, what is the reason that a lawyer from Michael 
11 Brown's family don't give you official copy of the 
12 autopsy, why what is the reason? 
13 A This is the first I've heard. I don't 
14 speak frequently to the lawyers, this is the first I 
15 heard that they were given the official autopsy 
16 before it came out in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: I didn't say it was before 
18 it was leaked, I just said it was in late October. 
19 
20 
21 
A I think I heard the I got the leak copy 
somewhere around late October also. I didn't know 
that, I'll ask them. If I've been under the 
22 assumption that the family, it wasn't released. 
23 Normal people can't interpret autopsy reports once 
24 the autopsy is released, you need a physician to 
25 interpret what it all means, all the different

1 organs and bodies and medical terms. 
2 So I expect that once it was 
3 released, I would be asked to explain it to the 
4 family and I wasn't asked to explain it to the 
5 family until later on. 
6 Giving you the copy is not 
7 released to the press, it is a lawyer, who has the 
8 official copy. What is the reason they don't give 
9 you the copy, I don't understand that? 
10 A I don't know, I'll have to ask him. 
11 It don't seem correct to me, 
12 but that is my opinion. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify, Doctor, 
14 where did you get, I know you said you saw the copy 
15 on the internet? 
16 A No, I said probably. I got a duplicate 
17 copy was sent to me. 
18 
19 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Do you know who sent it. 
I think it was an attorney or it was a 
20 newspaper reporter wanting me to comment on it or 
21 something. It was emailed, something was emailed to 
22 me. I think it was from the reporter, from the 
23 attorney, but that was from St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
24 release, which I agree with the gentleman, it is 
25 interesting, I'm not going to take it as gospel.

1 Did Mr. Brown's parents ever 
2 say in your questioning of them that he had like a 
3 childhood behavior problem or anything like that? 
4 A He did not. I spoke to the mom and dad. 
5 One of the questions I wanted to know, the purpose 
6 of the autopsy is any surgical or medical 
7 conditions, and as far as I was told, was perfectly 
8 healthy. I know sometimes families, especially when 
9 they're grieving, just say that and without 
10 necessarily thinking about it or anything. So as 
11 far as I know, as I stand here today, sit here 
12 today, as far as the autopsy and toxicology would 
13 show, I see no evidence of prior medical conditions 
14 or that he was under any treatment for medical 
15 conditions.

A 
Q 
This was a significant event, yes. 
Significant? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And so at some point were you 
19 notified that your supervisor or someone else had 
20 been notified that Ferguson was calling St. Louis 
21 County to assist in an investigation of an officer 
22 involved shooting? 
23 A I was. 
24 Q Were you still down at St. Anthony's when 
25 you heard about that call?

I was. 
And at this point, had the incident at St. 
3 Anthony's resolved or was it wrapping up or was it 
4 still ongoing? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
It was still ongoing. 
And so what happened when you learned that 
7 there was a call for assistance up in Ferguson? 
8 A Essentially a skeleton crew of detectives 
9 from the bureau of Crimes Against Persons remained 
10 at St. Anthony's and the remainders of the 
11 detectives got in their cars and drove up to 
12 Ferguson. 
13 Q So drove directly to Ferguson? 
14 A Directly. 
15 Q So you didn't stop and get any riot gear 
16 or anything that might be necessary for, you know, 
17 dealing with an unruly crowd? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Were you advised that you were needed for 
20 crowd control or were you advised that you were 
21 needed to assist in the investigation or to take 
22 over the investigation? 
23 A We were made aware that the Ferguson 
24 Police Department was requesting St. Louis County 
25 conduct an investigation into the incident. And so

1 our sole purpose for going up there was for the 
2 investigation aspect of it. 
3 Q Okay. Were you aware that Ferguson, prior 
4 to them requesting the County take over the 
5 investigation, were you aware that Ferguson had 
6 called St. Louis County as well as some neighboring 
7 municipalities for the purpose of crowd control?

A 
Q

Q 
Initially, no. 
Okay. You now know that; is that right? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. About what time did you arrive up 
12 in Ferguson? 
13 A About 1:30. 
14 Q And did your supervisor arrive up there as 
15 well? 
16 A About the same time, yes. 
17 Q And how many detectives from your squad 
18 were up there?

1 Q Did you observe a number of Ferguson 
2 police officers on scene? 
3 A I did. 
4 Q Did observe a number of St. Louis County 
5 uniformed patrolmen on the scene? 
6 A I did. 
7 Q So when you went up there that day, you 
8 and all the other detectives, as well as your 
9 supervisor, were you wearing police uniforms or were 
10 you dressed in street clothes? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Street clothes, shirt and tie. 
And did you, were you wearing a bullet 
13 proof vest? 
14 A Initially, no. 
15 Q So describe for the grand jurors the scene 
16 when you arrived on Canfield on the 9th? 
17 A Sure. I drove up by myself, however, 
18 other detectives were arriving at the same time in 
19 
20 
their vehicles. I came in off of West Florissant 
and drove east on Canfield. I was unable to drive 
21 even into the apartment complex itself. There was 
22 quite a few cars, police cars and police officers 
23 and then a crowd of individuals who blocked my way. 
24 So I parked, I think it is 3000 block 
25 of Canfield, and walked up to the scene, as did most

1 of the other detectives who were arriving at that 
2 time. 
3 Q So when you turned onto Canfield Drive off 
4 of West Florissant, initially you're in a single 
5 family home, residential area; is that correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q So the place where you said you had to get 
8 out and walk, can you see it on the map, which is 
9 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 25? 
10 A It would have either been 3027 Canfield or 
11 possibly even beyond 3720 Canfield to the west, so 
12 further off the map. 
13 Q So from when you got out of your car you 
14 walked on foot, where did you go on to? 
15 A I walked up and contacted the other 
16 detectives from my unit who are arriving on the 
17 scene and then we made brief contact with Chief 
18 from Ferguson Police Department who was 
19 already on the scene.

2 Michael Brown still lying in the street? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Was he covered with a sheet at that time? 
Yes. 
Did you see any emergency vehicles that 
7 were nonpolice officers vehicles at that time 
8 firetrucks, ambulances or anything of that nature? 
9 A In the scene itself, no. I couldn't say 
10 outside of the scene, there may have been. 
11 Q Okay. Was the scene already taped off 
12 when you got up there? 
13 A It was. 
14 Q And you said there were a number of people 
15 on foot, or pedestrians that were in the area? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q Can you describe how many and what the 
18 mood or the, what was going on when you got up 
19 there? 
20 A Sure. The area was essentially taped off 
21 using yellow crime scene tape. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
You can use this laser pointer. 
For example, if you look here at Building 
24 18, and you look at Building 17, the tape would have 
25 been draped from 17 to 18. And then I believe from

1 17 up to the north and then again from Building 5 
2 across this general direction where Canfield Drive 
3 and the circle area of Canfield Drive meet, and then 
4 down roughly, again, down around to Building 18. 
5 Now, if a building was able to be 
6 used, sometimes vehicles were used, sometimes trees 
7 were used, or signs, whatever was available to

To affix the tape onto you mean? 
Correct. 
Was Darren Wilson's vehicle still on the 
It was. 
Was his vehicle in the crime scene? 
It was. 
And to your knowledge, was his vehicle in 
17 the same place where it was when he stopped the 
18 vehicle and eventually got out of the car? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And so was there any 
21 discussion amongst your squad and your supervisor 
22 about how, well, how was it decided that you would 
23 be assigned to be the primary case officer on this? 
24 A I volunteered. My caseload was at the 
25 time what I considered lower than the other

1 detectives who were working, so I volunteered to 
2 take it. 
3 Q You said I'll handle this? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q So from that point on, are you directing 
6 the investigation? 
7 A For the most part, yes. 
8 Q And as the primary officer, do you get 
9 information from other detectives about what they 
10 are doing? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And do you assign other detectives or 
13 other police officers tasks or responsibilities or 
14 duties in the investigation? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And do you relay information that you are 
17 learning to your supervisor?

19 
A 
Q 
20 that day? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I do. 
And so how long were you up at the scene 
I would say I left roughly 7:00p.m. 
And you're aware that the shooting 
23 actually took place shortly, and I mean within 
24 minutes after the noon hour that day, correct?

1 Q And so, and you're aware that the body of 
2 Michael Brown actually laid on the roadway for 
3 several hours, as much as four or four and a half 
4 hours before it was eventually removed and 
5 transported to the Medical Examiner's Office, 
6 correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q In your experience as a crime scene, well, 
9 as a detective, is that longer than usual? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Was there anything going on at the scene 
12 that inhibited or complicated the crime scene 
13 investigation that was going on? 
14 A Absolutely, yes. 
Q And what was that? 15 
16 A The crowd who essentially was standing 
17 around the crime scene tape on all points was upset, 
18 they were yelling obscenities on a regular basis at 
19 police, they were threatening to kill the police. 
20 At one point gunshots were fired from 
21 an area relatively close to the crime scene and I 
22 couldn't say exactly, but I would say it came from 
23 roughly this area right in here around Building 16 
24 and 17. 
25 There were people who were attempting

1 to breach the crime scene, meaning go under the 
2 crime scene tape for whatever reason. That happened 
3 on several occasions. It was a very chaotic scene. 
4 It was a scene that I had never experienced anything 
5 like that. 
6 Q Now, you mention that when you got there, 
7 you didn't have a bulletproof vest on. Was there a 
8 decision at sometime for you and your fellow police 
9 officers to put on a bulletproof vest? 
10 A After those gunshots were fired, we all 
11 returned to our cars where we keep our vest and we 
12 put our vest on. 
13 Q Other than the vest, did you have any 
14 other protective gear, like did you have those riot 
15 helmets with the face shields? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
I did not. 
Any batons that you were carrying? 
No. 
Did you see other officers on the scene 
20 that were dressed in riot gear? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Riot gear, no. 
Did you see, and you've heard people talk 
23 about that there were dogs on the scene? 
24 A Initially, no. As the incident 
25 progressed, yes, dogs were requested.

8 scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Why were dogs requested to respond to the 
In an attempt to secure the scene. 
Okay. At about what time was it that the 
11 decision was made to request canine units respond? 
12 A I couldn't say exactly, but at the time 
13 the gunshots went off we realized that we were 
14 dealing with a very volitate situation and request 
15 from several different units within the police 
16 department were made for assistance in securing the 
17 scene and in protecting the officers who were out 
18 there. 
19 Q Now, we've already heard testimony from 
20 officers who were involved in processing the crime 
21 scene and in your, how many years have you been a 
22 detective? 
23 A Roughly eight.

1 investigating? 
2 A It would be a complete guess, 60, 70, 
3 maybe. 
4 Q So you're familiar with the job and the 
5 duties that a crime scene, or we call them the ID 
6 unit, you're familiar with what they do when they 
7 arrive at a crime scene, correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
I am. 
And would it be fair to say that they, as 
10 the crime scene investigator, they consider that, 
11 that that's their scene to control, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Did you make the decision on who was to be 
14 the crime scene detective in charge of that scene 
15 that day? 
16 A I did not. 
17 Q So how is it that that, we know that 
18 Officer was the primary crime scene 
19 investigator. How was it that it was decided that 
20 Detective would be the crime scene 
21 investigator? 
22 A The crime scene detectives have areas that 
23 they are assigned and if an incident happens within 
24 their given area, typically they are responsible for 
25 that, however, the decision ultimately rests with

1 the crime scene supervisor to delegate out who is 
2 responsible for, for example, the Crime Scene Unit. 
3 Q Okay. So you all just called for Crime 
4 Scene to respond and then they determine, the Crime 
5 Scene supervisor determines who is going to respond 
6 that day, correct? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q Okay. When you first arrived around 
9 1:30-ish, was St. Louis County ID Unit on the scene? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
I believe they had just arrived. 
And when you arrived initially, did you 
12 notice that there were cones that had been placed at 
13 various locations in the street and within the crime 
14 scene itself? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I did. 
Okay. Did you ever, prior to the Crime 
17 Scene Unit getting there and beginning their 
18 investigation, did you ever walk the crime scene?

20 
21 
22

Q

Before they began their investigation?

23 the vehicles, the officer's vehicle and the body? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750

Did you see other detectives walking and

1 other police officers walking in the street and in 
2 that area? 
3 A I did. 
4 Q Okay. Now, is that something that is, 
5 well, given that the crime scene unit had not yet 
6 arrived to begin processing the scene or had not 
7 begun to process the scene, would that be something 
8 that in hindsight or is that something that 
9 shouldn't happen, people walking through the crime 
10 scene before it is processed? 
11 A Ideally, no. In this particular instance, 
12 the scene was, obviously, an outdoor scene. There 
13 was a need to take an overall assessment of what the 
14 situation was at that point, and so without 
15 disturbing any evidence or without walking near 
16 evidence, yes. There was some walking that had 
17 taken place just to get an overall assessment. 
18 Q Okay. And so at this point then Detective 
19 arrived and began processing the crime scene. 
20 Was his job interrupted at any point?

1 A Essentially the same instances that I had 
2 previously mentioned. The threats coming from the 
3 crowd, people trying to, as I said, breach the crime 
4 scene, meaning come under the tape and come into the 
5 crime scene and then, of course, the gunshots. 
6 Q All right. Was this scene complicated 
7 because it was outdoors, just in general, does that 
8 complicate a crime scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No, not necessarily. 
Okay. So you believe that the primary 
11 factors that complicated your job on-scene that day 
12 was the crowd? 
13 A Yes, I do. 
14 Q Urn, did you make any attempts, well, all 
15 right, so detectives, describe for the grand jurors 
16 then, once the crime scene was in the process of 
17 beginning their processing of the scene, what did 
18 you do to further the investigation? 
19 A As I said, I originally spoke with Chief 
20 who indicated that the best person from the 
21 Ferguson Police Department to talk to would be 
22 
23 
Sergeant 
Sergeant 
I then went over and spoke with 
, as long as with several other 
24 detectives that I worked with, and we again, had a 
25 brief conversation with Sergeant 
FAX 314-241-6750

who indicated

Page 195 
1 to us, I'm sorry, who provided to us the information 
2 that he knew at the time. 
3 And then from there based on the 
4 information that Sergeant had provided, we 
5 initiated the investigation. 
6 Q So did Sergeant tell you that the 
7 police officer involved in the shooting was Darren 
8 Wilson? 
A He did. 9 
10 Q And now, did you know when you volunteered 
11 to take this assignment that the officer's name was 
12 Darren Wilson? 
13 A I did not. 
14 Q Okay. Are you in to 
15 Darren Wilson? 
16 A Absolutely not, no. 
17 Q After you learned that Darren Wilson was 
18 the officer involved, did you make attempts to see 
19 if there was 
20 ? 
21 A I'm very familiar with in the 
22 St. Louis area, , no. 
23 Q Okay. Have you ever met Darren Wilson? 
24 A

3 Q Did you then assign detectives to go to a 
4 different location? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
I did. 
Where did you assign detectives to go? 
I assigned Detective , also of the 
8 Bureau of Crimes Against Persons, to go to the 
9 Ferguson Police Department where officer Darren 
10 Wilson had driven to after the incident. 
11 Q So you learned that Darren Wilson had gone 
12 back to the Ferguson station? 
13 A I did. 
14 Q And so what about, was there any decision 
15 to send a different crime scene investigator to go 
16 and seize Darren Wilson's weapon and to collect any 
17 other evidence he might need to collect at the 
18 station? 
19

1 Q And so was it from the scene that you were 
2 making decisions and directing various aspects of 
3 the investigation? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And all along the way were other 
6 detectives contacting you or giving you information 
7 about what they were finding, what they were 
8 learning and so forth? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
They were. 
Okay. And so when you were on the scene, 
11 Detective, did you learn that there were individuals 
12 who were residents or who had been down on Canfield 
13 that day who had scene some or part of the incident 
14 involving, between the officer and Michael Brown? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And were there, was there a decision to 
17 direct a couple of the crime scene officers to 
18 actually take, I don't know, I'm calling them 
19 perspective videos, do you know what I mean when I 
20 say perspective videos? 
21 
22

I do.

23 perspective video is?

1 standing when a particular incident happened. 
2 So, for example, if an incident 
3 happened in this room, my perspective would be from 
4 this chair right here, we would simply take video 
5 from the chair that I'm sitting in. 
6 Q And so during your investigation and, you 
7 know, we know that this is a complex with several 
8 buildings, several units in each building. We know 
9 that the incident occurs, there's several yards in

11 in your investigation you were also aware that there 
12 were some witnesses who testified that they were, I

19 A Yes. She originally pulled up in the 
20 parking spot and pulled right here, exit her vehicle 
21 and we had one so that's why you see originally 
22 stationary shot but then the detective begins to

1 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now during your 
2 investigation, in the early days, now this all 
3 happened on the same day of the shooing; is that 
4 right? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And at this point in your investigation, 
7 the FBI, the federal authorities were not involved 
8 in the investigation; is that right? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
But within a day or two you learned that 
11 the FBI was going to either assist or co-investigate 
12 with the County? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q Was there some confusion between St. Louis 
15 County and the federal authorities what role they 
16 were taking or whether they were assisting you were 
17 you going to share information, and so forth? 
18 A It took a little bit to coordinate the 
19 logistics of how the investigation would be run 
20 parallel to one another, yes. 
21 Q And so the Saturday after the shooting, so 
22 one week from the time of the shooting there was 
23 talk or decision about the detectives going to the 
24 Canfield Apartment Complex and doing a canvas? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

Q

Page 210 
What's a canvas? 
Essentially going to a given area and 
3 knocking on doors or meeting people walking through 
4 the area and asking them if they had witnessed 
5 anything that had taken place at a given time. 
6 So, for example, in this particular 
7 investigation, it would have been for August 9th, 
8 the previous Saturday. 
9 Q Okay. Now, had the County done some 
10 canvassing on the day of the shooting? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, it had, yes. 
You had not canvassed the entire complex? 
We canvassed a majority of the buildings 
14 that would of had a direct line of sight to where 
15 the incident took place. Either being where the 
16 police vehicle stopped, or where we could say what 
17 would be the furthest point to the east right around 
18 here. Any building with a direct line of sight we 
19 would have made attempts to canvas.

1 work during the shooting, I didn't see anything, you 
2 note that, correct? 
3 A We note that as well, yes. 
4 Q If somebody says, yeah, I heard gunshots 
5 but I didn't see anything, you would note that? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And if there was somebody who says I saw 
8 what happened and I saw parts of it, then you would 
9 interview that person, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when you say you, you had other 
12 detectives doing that on this day; is that correct? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q And in the days to follow, did you learn 
15 that there were other witnesses that maybe weren't 
16 home during the canvas, were you leaving cards at 
17 houses where there was nobody home? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
We were not, no. 
But as the days progressed you learned 
20 that there were people that were there, claimed to 
21 have been there but you didn't talk to that day for 
22 one reason or another, correct?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
He did not. 
Had he ever seen him before? 
He had not. 
And during your interview with Darren 
11 Wilson, did you, well, strike that. Did you later 
12 during the early days of your investigation, are 
13 there officers that were monitoring the news, and 
14 websites, Facebook pages and so forth just trying to 
15 see if there were other witnesses to this?

18 young man that was with Michael Brown?

Now, we've seen some video of interviews 
and ? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And those were in interview rooms? 
That's correct. 
Now Darren Johnson (sic) was potentially a 
7 suspect in a homicide investigation, correct?

9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
He could have been, yes. 
He had shot and killed somebody, correct? 
Yes. 
Wouldn't you normally interview a suspect 
12 in a homicide investigation? 
13 A Just for clarification, you say Darren 
14 Wilson, I'm sorry, you said Darren Johnson, we are 
15 talking about Darren Wilson; is that right? 
16 Q How many times have I done that, I've 
17 called you and I've called Darren 
18 Wilson, , I'm sorry. So, yes, I'm sorry. 
19 We're talking about Officer Wilson? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And he potentially was a suspect, were you 
22 treating him as a suspect at this point? 
23 A He had an attorney present. He was viewed 
24 as the subject of the investigation at this point. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And so you hadn't arrested him at

1 this point; is that right? 
A That's correct. 2 
3 Q So your investigation was about what, at 
4 this point you knew that Darren Wilson had shot and 
5 killed Michael Brown; is that correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q Did you feel that you had probable cause 
8 at that time to arrest Darren Wilson? 
A No. 9 
10 Q And so what further information did you 
11 need to make that determination? 
12 A Well, obviously, the purpose of the 
13 interview would be to gather Darren Wilson's 
14 statement of what took place that day. 
15 Q Okay. But Darren Wilson had already been 
16 interviewed by 
17 A That interview is considered a, 
18 essentially a public safety statement where we are 
19 obtaining brief information to gather the most basic 
20 facts of the incident to insure we're not looking 
21 for suspects, victims, to make sure that we don't 
22 have any errant rounds into any buildings, things of 
23 that nature. 
24 That initial interview with 
25 Detectives

was not a full-on recorded

1 interview, was more of a safety statement or safety 
2 interview, I should say. 
3 Q All right. So we heard the term cursory 
4 interview used, would you consider 
5 interview on that to be more cursory interview? 
6 A That's an appropriate terminology, yes. 
7 Q So now what was the purpose of your 
8 interview then? 
9 A My interview would have been to gather a 
10 detailed statement from Officer Darren Wilson and 
11 then obviously to have that statement recorded. 
12 Q And have you ever been involved in 
13 investigations of officer involved shootings? 
14 A I have, yes. 
15 Q Have you ever been involved in 
16 investigations of excessive force used that maybe 
17 didn't involve shooting? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
I have. 
And did you treat this investigation any 
20 differently than you would have or have in the past 
21 treated any other officer involved shooting 
22 investigation? 
23 A No. 
24 Q So after you, so when you spoke with 
25 Darren Wilson, he had an attorney present, is that

1 unusual when an officer is involved in a shooting? 
2 A There are instances where officers request 
3 to have an attorney and there are instances where 
4 they do not request to have an attorney, and that is 
5 purely up to the officer. 
6 Q All right. So you've seen it both ways? 
7 A I've seen it both ways, yes. 
8 Q Of course, if Darren Wilson wanted to 
9 refuse to be interviewed, he could do that, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
He could. 
And you couldn't compel him to give a 
12 statement, could you? 
13 A I cannot. 
14 Q So after the interview with Darren Wilson, 
15 did you place him under arrest? 
16 A I did not. 
17 Q Why not? 
18 A I did not believe there was probable cause 
19 to arrest him. 
20 Q And this was on the midmorning of the day 
21 after the shooting; is that right?

3 Q And you're aware that there are other 
4 witnesses out there that we are trying to locate in 
5 relation to what they may or may not have seen that 
6 day, correct? 
7 A I'm aware of that, yes. 
8 Q You are still working on this case; is 
9 that right? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Urn, and so after speaking with detective, 
12 or I'm sorry, with Officer Wilson, you allowed him 
13 to leave with his attorney? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q And as the days and weeks continued on 
16 with this investigation, have you always been the 
17 primary on this investigation? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
I have. 
And can you give, now, let's go back. Now 
20 we are talking about the FBI getting involved. Some 
21 days after in the first week of the shooting? 
22 
23 
A Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You have a question okay? 
24 If Officer Wilson wasn't an 
25 officer, even though he done the shooting, would

Page 223 
1 that civilian had been arrested considering there 
2 was a deceased on the ground? 
3 A Well, the circumstances between a civilian 
4 and a police officer are somewhat different. So I 
5 don't know that without the specifics, all the 
6 specific facts of an incident like that I could give 
7 you a fair answer. 
8 I will tell you that I have conducted 
9 investigations in the past on civilian shootings, 
10 other civilians and it has been deemed justified. 
11 Is that what you are kind of asking? 
12 Well, yes and no, but a 
13 shooting, just a shooting, you caught the person who 
14 shot, so that person is arrested. The shooter 
15 didn't flee and there's a deceased on the ground, 
16 would that person have been arrested right then and 
17 there. 
18 A I think without being in a particular 
19 situation like that, I don't think I could answer 
20 that question. There is too many variables that go 
21 into something like that. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: So let me see if I can 
23 clarify. 
24 Officer's allowed to use force and even 
25 deadly force to affect an arrest in Missouri, you

1 are aware of that, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am, I am. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 224 
2 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) It all depends on the 
4 circumstances, correct? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then you're also aware that 
7 individuals, whether they be police officers or even 
8 private citizens are allowed to use force to defend 
9 themselves? 
A I am aware of that. 10 
11 Q Even deadly force under certain 
12 circumstances? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 Q I'm going to give you a what if scenario. 
15 If a woman is at home by herself and asleep in her 
16 bed and somebody unknown to her breaks into her 
17 house and attacks her and she obtains a weapon and 
18 shoots him dead. She calls the police and the 
19 police arrive. And if you had this basic 
20 information that this person had broken into the 
21 house. This woman didn't know him, she's in her 
22 night clothes, it is 2:00 in the morning and he's 
23 dead on the ground, would you have arrested that 
24 person for a homicide at that point? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Probably not, no.

1 Q And so you're determination on whether or 
2 not to arrest somebody you feel that you need more 
3 facts, or in this case at least as of the lOth of 
4 August, did you feel you needed more facts before 
5 you made a determination on whether he should be 
6 arrested? 
7 A I feel that it is critically important in 
8 any case, including this case, to gather as many 
9 facts as I can before any kind of determination be 
10 made in terms of arrest, yes. 
11 Q Now, and for purposes of educating the 
12 grand jurors, you might know some of this from your 
13 prior experiences with other cases on the grand 
14 jury, when a police officer arrests a suspect and 
15 places him in custody, he has the option of 
16 releasing him pending a warrant application, 
17 correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And he also has the option of holding him 
20 in custody and making a warrant application within 
21 24 hours of him being placed in custody, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's also correct, yes. 
Okay. And so you chose not to do either 
24 of those, you just let Darren Wilson walk out of the 
25 police department?

Did you believe that he was a flight risk 
12 at that time?

14 Q Did his attorneys give you assurances that 
15 they would produce him if need be at a later date, 
16 whether it be for further questioning or in the 
17 event that charges were issued, he would surrender 
18 him to you? 
A They did, yes. 19 
20 Q And so flight risk, danger to the 
21 community, are those some of the considerations that

9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, on that date, and certainly on the 
10 days to follow, you became very aware, didn't you, 
11 Detective that the public was very intent, 
12 not the public, but there were people in the public 
13 eye and people that were making their voices known 
14 that they wanted to have Officer Wilson arrested and

arrested or charged with an offense?

22 probable cause for an arrest.

3 A That's correct. 
4 Q I was the attorney on-call when this 
5 happened? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And so at some point was there a decision 
8 made between my office and County Police that there 
9 would be a grand jury investigation into this 
10 matter? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
There was. 
Okay. And so at that point is there a 
13 decision made that the evidence presented to the 
14 grand jury, it will be their decision on whether or 
15 not charges should be brought against Officer 
16 Wilson? 
17 A At that time, yes. 
18 Q And if this grand jury determines that 
19 Officer Wilson should be charged with an offense and 
20 if they sign an indictment in this case, will you 
21 arrest Darren Wilson for the offense?

9 So Detective , the first week of the 
10 investigation we knew that the FBI was getting 
11 involved, correct? 
12 A That's correct. 
13 Q And initially you said that there was some 
14 confusion about what role they were taking if they 
15 were there to assist the county or if they were 
16 going to conduct their own investigation, whether or 
17 not information was going to be shared, whether or 
18 not investigations were going to be coordinated. 
19 And there was talk the following Saturday that there 
20 was going be a canvas of the entire apartment 
21 complex, correct? 
22 A That's correct. 
23 Q And as of Friday, the plan was that the 
24 FBI and County Police together were going to canvas 
25 the apartment complex?

That's correct. 
Okay. And at some point on Friday evening 
3 was there, were you advised that there was a 
4 decision made that the County would not be involved 
5 in that canvas of the apartments? 
6 A I was. 
7 Q Okay. So St. Louis County did not play a 
8 role in the canvas that took place on the 16th of 
9 August involving numerous FBI agents? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
When the FBI would identify people who 
12 claim to have witness some part of this, would they 
13 share that information with you? 
14 A They would. 
15 Q And when they would interview people, now,

4 substance or pertinent to the investigation, most of 
5 those interviews were recorded, but they were 
6 recorded on the scene by the agents, correct? 
7 A That's correct. 
8 Q Okay. And, in fact, when the county was 
9 investigating, a lot of their interviews were done 
10 at various locations, county libraries?

14 Q Did I say that wrong? What did I say?

16 of these witnesses had attorneys and interviews were 
17 done at attorney's office, correct? 
A That's correct. 18 
19 Q So basically you would go wherever you 
20 needed to go to talk to witnesses?

2 FBI headquarters, would they advise you in advance 
3 that they were going to be interviewing a witness? 
4 A They would.

14 A There were. 
15 Q And on those occasions, would they get you 
16 the copies of the recordings of those interviews? 
17 A Yes, they would. 
18 Q Okay. And so I'm going to characterize 
19 some of these witnesses as FBI witnesses. You and I 
20 talk about the fact that we say, oh, so and so was 
21 an FBI witness. That would be somebody that the FBI 
22 had identified as a witness and that they had 
23 conducted the interview, correct?

1 were interviewed, and not just the witnesses who 
2 said I wasn't home, or I was home but I didn't hear 
3 or see anything. But out of all the witnesses that 
4 were actually talked to that heard or saw something, 
5 between County Police and the FBI, can you give me 
6 an estimate how many people were interviewed? 
7 A Roughly 80. 
8 Q And then regarding other witnesses that 
9 may have been interviewed, from paramedics 
10 A I'm sorry, would you repeat your last 
11 question? Maybe I misunderstood here. 
12 Q Between the FBI and the County Police, can 
13 you give me an idea or an estimate about as to how 
14 many witnesses were interviewed, and I'm talking 
15 about eyewitness type people that said they saw or 
16 heard something that day? 
17 A I'd like to clarify that. That number is 
18 closer to 50. 
19 Q Okay. So when you say 80, were you 
20 including a different type of witness or other 
21 people? 
22 A I was. The 80 number is essentially those 
23 roughly 50, and then in addition to those roughly 
24 50, there would have been other people who have been 
25 in some form or another involved in some aspect of

1 the incident itself, or someone who we during the 
2 course of the investigation felt it would have been 
3 important for us to talk to. 
4 Q So the 50 relates to civilians who maybe 
5 said they were eyewitness to some part of this? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q So the additional witnesses are people 
8 like paramedics, the hospital personnel that treated

Q 
12 Market? 
13 A 
14 Q 
Correct. 
You spoke to the owners of the Ferguson 
Correct. 
At some point in your investigation did 
15 you learn that prior to the shooting, Michael Brown 
16 was involved in an incident that occurred up at the 
17 Ferguson Market? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And at some point did you obtain the video 
20 of that incident? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
We did. 
And at some point did you interview the 
23 owner and other people who were present during that 
24 incident,?

And during your interview of them, did 
2 their statements, let me ask you this. In the video 
3 we see that there's a bunch of people there? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q There's the shopkeeper who is in the video 
6 and we see his interaction with Michael Brown, but 
7 there's other people you can see in the video? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Were you able to identify everybody who 
10 appears in the video? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
We were not. 
So were you able to identify some people 
13 who appear in the video? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q And when you spoke to, when you spoke to 
16 the owner of the shop, the man who appears, the 
17 shorter man in the video, he doesn't speak fluent 
18 English; is that correct? 
A He does not. 19 
20 Q So you interviewed him with the assistance 
21 of an interpreter? 
A Yes, ma'am. 22 
23 Q And then you spoke to another witness who 
24 was present in the Ferguson Market for that incident 
25 is that right?

2 Q The statements of those people do they, 
3 were their statements consistent with what you see 
4 in the video? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Their statements were consistent, yes. 
Okay. Now, during the interviews, and 
7 we've seen in the video that there is no audio to 
8 the video, correct? 
9 A That's correct. 
10 Q And during the interviews of those people, 
11 and backing up a little bit, since your interview of 
12 these people, has there market been looted and 
13 burglarized and damaged during the riots that took 
14 place afterwards? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
It has, yes. 
And do you know, do the people who own 
17 that market feel that is because the citizens in 
18 that surrounding area talk, because they talk to the 
19 police? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
I believe so, yes. 
And have they expressed a reluctance, a 
22 huge reluctance to actually be assisting in the 
23 investigation? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Very much so, yes, very reluctant. 
And so when you spoke to the man in the

1 video through an interpreter, did you get any 
2 additional information about what was said or what 
3 was heard during that incident? 
4 A The male clerk, again, did not speak very 
5 good English and he couldn't necessarily recall what 
6 was being said, but he identified that curse words 
7 were being said by the individual he identified as 
8 Michael Brown. 
9 Q Okay. So he doesn't, he didn't know what 
10 the curse words were? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
He did not. 
But he was able to, but he knows that 
13 there were curse words? 
14 A He does, yes. 
15 Q Was there another person present at the 
16 Ferguson Market who also heard words being 
17 exchanged? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And what did that person say, 
20 if anything, does that person speak fluent English? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What, if anything, do you recall that 
23 person saying about what was heard between Michael

25 between them or anything that was heard during the

1 incident? 
November 13, 2014 
Page 238 
2 A This person missed the initial portion of 
3 the encounter, however, at the end of the encounter, 
4 the person indicated that they observed Michael 
5 Brown pushing the store clerk and begin to walk 
6 away. The clerk then, I'm sorry, the clerk was 
7 pushed and Michael Brown took essentially one more 
8 step back towards the clerk after having been pushed 
9 and the individual said that they heard Michael 
10 Brown make a comment to the effect of, what the fuck 
11 are you going to do about it. 
12 Q Okay. And that person that heard that 
13 speaks English fluently? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And now during the course of the 
16 investigation, getting back to this, you've 
17 interviewed, you said hospital personnel, ambulance 
18 people, you've interviewed people up at the Ferguson 
19 Market, did you check for video surveillance in the 
20 apartment complex? 
21 A We checked several different ways. And we 
22 were able to determine that there was no video in 
23 the complex. 
24 Q Urn, at some point during the investigation 
25 did you hear a rumor or were there people that were

1 talking about the fact that there were video cameras 
2 on the buildings in the Canfield Green Apartment 
3 Complex and that police officers were observed to 
4 have been taking those cameras down on the day of 
5 the incident? 
6 A I did hear that, yes. 
7 Q And after having heard that, did you 
8 investigate that whether or not there were cameras 
9 that had been up there? 
10 A Well, during the initial investigation at 
11 the scene on the 9th, obviously, one of the things 
12 we do in this, and in every investigation, is look 
13 for cameras. So that was the top of our list of 
14 things to do to see if there was any video cameras. 
15 A lot of apartment complexes in the 
16 St. Louis area do have video cameras that they 
17 maintain themselves or there is other companies that 
18 come in and provide video security systems for the 
19 complex. 
20 So we thoroughly checked ourselves to 
21 see if there was any cameras on light poles or 
22 buildings or stairways, or whatever. We did not 
23 find anything. 
24 In addition to that, we contacted the 
25 on-site property manager for the Canfield Green

1 Apartment Complex and clarified with her our beliefs 
2 that there were no visible cameras, she said there 
3 were not. She said that they didn't have any other 
4 than one particular camera and that was an interior, 
5 inside the building in a basement camera that faced 
6 the laundry room that watched essentially the 
7 laundry area to make sure people weren't taking 
8 change out of the washing machines. 
9 In addition to that, we also 
10 contacted the, what I would call the corporate 
11 offices for the complex and we spoke with the owner 
12 of the complex who also confirmed there were no 
13 cameras in the complex. 
14 Q All right. You've never discovered that 
15 there were ever any cameras on the 9th, at least 
16 that were up in the complex that might have recorded 
17 any of this incident on Canfield? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Now, you learned during your investigation 
20 that there were several people that had used their 
21 phones or their personal electronic devices to 
22 record portions of what happened on that day, 
23 correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
That's correct. 
Have you ever learned that there was a

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXIII November 13, 2014 
Page 241 
1 recording that actually captured any part of the 
2 incident from the time the officer sees the two men 
3 walking down the street until after the shooting is 
4 over? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No. 
So the videos that you discovered and seen 
7 all deal with the aftermath, after Michael Brown is 
8 already been shot and is dead in the street? 
9 A Yes, ma'am. 
10 Q Urn, and you're aware that there are a 
11 number of, still a number of witnesses or people who 
12 have given statements either to law enforcement 
13 officers or to other people that they have seen 
14 something to do with this, and yet they have not 
15 appeared before the grand jury? 
16 A That's correct. 
17 Q And that might be because we can't 
18 identify them. For example, there was a witness 
19 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
who said he was with somebody named 
Were we able to identify that person? 
We were not, no. 
And then talks about having 
23 a female in his car, but he doesn't know her name. 
24 Were we able to identify that opinions? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
We were not.

Q There is a person who talks about somebody 
named who maybe saw something, did we ever 
1 
2 
3 identify who was? 
4 A Not positively, no. 
5 Q Then there were a number of people who 
6 called, whether they called into the tip line, 
7 whether they made 911 calls, whether they made calls 
8 into radio, media, like the Tommy Sotomayor show, 
9 were there attempts to find out who those people 
10 were? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Multiple attempts, yes. 
And there were times when you were 
13 successful in finding out who those people were, for 
14 example, who is the person that called into Tommy 
15 Sotomayor? 
16 A 
17 Q But there are still 
18 other people that you were never able to identify 
19 who those persons were, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am. 20 
21 Q And then are there still a few witnesses 
22 who you have been able to identify who have said 
23 that they saw something, who refuse to make a 
24 statement to law enforcement officials? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, that's correct.

1 Q And are there still a number of witnesses 
2 who actually have made statements to law enforcement 
3 officials and who refuse to come in to testify to 
4 the grand jury, either because we can't find them 
5 now, they're hiding, they're out of state, or they 
6 might, we just can't get them in even if we serve 
7 subpoenas, they refuse to come in? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's true, yes. 
And so you and I and Sheila Whirley have 
10 been working very closely with the presentation of 
11 evidence during the investigation that began, the 
12 grand jury investigation that began on August 20th; 
13 is that right? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q And at times have I asked you to do 
16 various things that the grand jury has asked for? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Such as locate who Darren Wilson's field 
19 training officer was in Jennings? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And during your investigation did I ask 
22 you to go down to Canfield and take a number of 
23 photographs that again, I'll call perspective 
24 photographs that were, might show what somebody, 
25 what various witnesses might have seen on the day of

1 the shooting? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
I'm going to show you a series of 
Page 244 
4 photographs that are in Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
5 98. 
6 And you and I have gone over these 
7 photographs before and looked through them; is that 
8 right? 
A That's correct. 9 
10 Q And were you actually one of the, were you 
11 with the detective who actually took these 
12 photograph? 
13 A I was, yes. 
14 Q So describe for the grand jurors what you 
15 were doing here and what the goal was? 
16 A So essentially we made the decision to 
17 identify three particular points, specific points on 
18 Canfield, and stand in one particular spot of those 
19 three points. Take a series of consecutive 
20 overlapping photos in a 360-degree manner. 
21 So you could essentially put those 
22 photos together and you would get a 360-degree view 
23 of your surroundings. 
24 We decided to do that with three 
25 points. Those points would have been essentially at

1 the police car where the police car was originally 
2 located, at essentially the intersection of 
3 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive, this point 
4 right here. And then based on measurements that we 
5 took, again, this is all based on measurements, 
6 where Michael Brown's foot would have been the day 
7 of the incident, we used those three points of 
8 reference. 
9 Q Michael Brown's foot when he was laying in 
10 the street? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Those were measurements that you got from 
13 the crime scene diagram that was done by Detective 
14 on the day of the shooting? 
15 
16 
17 
A That's correct. 
Q So really we're going to go through some 
of these and we'll get through as many as we can. 
18 think at this point it will probably be we will see 
19 Detective back on Friday just to finish up 
I 
20 with him. I know Sheila has got some more with him, 
21 you all may have some questions and, of course, we 
22 have evidence for you to look at and view as well. 
23 So in this first image, which on the 
24 back I've marked as 1A. So all of the images that 
25 have a one, these are images from what vantage

1 point? 
2 A Uh, this would have been from Officer 
3 Wilson's police vehicle. 
4 A Okay. 
5 Q And so the detective photographed the cone 
6 in the street and this is where he was going to 
7 stand on top, not physically stand on top of the 
8 cone, but stand over the cone and turn while he made 
9 his photographs, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And so this image 1B, is that you can see 
12 the cone in this photograph and is this just to get 
13 a perspective of which view this is? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
It is. 
So this is not a perspective shot? 
That's a preparatory shot to identify 
17 where we're at. 
18 Q Okay. And so on 1C, this would be the 
19 first photograph that is a perspective shot from 
20 where Officer Wilson's vehicle was, correct? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And what direction is this looking? 
This is looking primarily south. 
Okay. And so if we know that the 
25 officer's vehicle was right about here and you can

1 see the front of the building says 2964, that's this 
2 location right here, correct? 
3 A That's correct. 
4 Q All right. And did you during your 
5 investigation identify if there was any witness that 
6 would have been in this photograph that would have 
7 said they witness something? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
No. 
And then in photograph 1D, is this, now 
10 the detective who is taking the photographs, if he 
11 started out by looking south on Canfield, is he 
12 turning clockwise? 
13 A He is. 
14 Q So now from this perspective, is he 
15 looking down which direction on Canfield? 
16 A He's looking west on Canfield. 
17 Q Okay. And so that would be looking in 
18 this direction, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And from this photograph which is where 
21 the police vehicle would have been, can you see a 
22 location where an eyewitness said that saw 
23 something?

2 witness are you talking about? 
3 A Would have been 
4 Q Okay. Now, looking west from here, the

his car,

and whoever was in

Q Did confirm that had somebody 
working, wasn't sure what day it was, but 
4 had somebody who worked that day? 
5 A did confirm that had somebody work

8 where this photograph is, can you see the location 
9 
10 
11 
where 
A 
Q 
said he was standing? 
Yes. 
And presumably if you had taken a 
12 photograph from that location, would you be able to 
13 see where the police car was? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q Okay. And then Exhibit 1E, in this 
16 grouping is again turning clockwise so. What 
17 building are we seeing in this photograph? 
18 A We are looking at this third photograph 
19 right here. This is 2973, which is part of Building 
20 2 and 2969, which is also part of Building 2. We 
21 can see a little bit of Building 3 on the far

1 right at the end of the picture? 
2 A Right. So the detective when he was 
3 taking the photograph would have been standing where 
4 the car was when he took that photograph. 
5 Okay. What about where the 
6 body laid at? 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: That's in another group of 
8 photographs. There's the car photographs, there's a 
9 point where he may have turned around by that pole 
10 and then there's where the body laid. 
11 What's the estimated 
distance from the car to where was? 12 
13 A From the car, I'm not sure I'd have to 
14 look it up. 
15 A couple hundred yards, 
16 100 yards, someone with good eyesight would be able 
17 to see clearly in your opinion? 
18 A Yes. I would say maybe not even 
19 100 yards.

1 it does through the camera? Would you be able to 
2 see more of it or would it be larger? 
3 A Urn, I think that is probably pretty 
4 consistent with what you would see. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You were out there on 
6 that day, correct?

12 that we wanted to have, we didn't want zoom

15 Q We wanted to have a lens that would be as

1 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, regarding your 
2 recollection of his testimony, y'all can compare 
3 notes on that or look back on the transcript. I'd 
4 rather not comment on where I think was or, you 
5 know, and we have a map here too that is also done 
6 for your assistance that also puts points where the 
7 detectives involved in the investigation believe 
8 people were, but that's only to assist you. These 
9 are just to assist you. 
10 So if your recollection is different or if 
11 you do not agree with what the pictures show or what 
12 the testimony is, that's your prerogative to agree 
13 or disagree or have different recollections, okay. 
14 So detective looking at this photograph 1E 
15 and you said now in this photograph we can see 
16 Building Number 2 and part of Building Number 3, can 
17 you, do you know who lived in Building Number 2 that 
18 said they were witness to this, do you need to look 
19 at the map?

22 
A 
Q 
In Building Number 2 would have been 
and and 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) They testified, I don't 
23 know you guys are going to have to be looking back 
24 on your notes. They testified that they lived on 
25 various floors in these buildings, correct? So from

1 the police car, someone who is on the balcony here 
2 very well could have seen what happened at the 
3 police car, is that fair to say? 
4 A That's fair to say. 
5 Who lived here, who did you 
6 say? 
7 A and 
8 
9 Q 
Can I look at the map just to clarify that? 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Just so we can make the 
10 record clear, I'm going to just, I don't have 
11 another easel yet today, we're going to get one for 
12 you, but this is a map that has 
13 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 101 
14 marked for identification.) 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
16 101 is the same map that has little stickers that 
17 show where various people say that they were, 
18 correct? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. 
20 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And you prepared that 
21 for me; is that right?

marked for identification.) 1 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Is this a legend that 
3 you prepared that corresponds with the number you 
4 gave those people? 
A It is. 5 
6 Q Just so that you all know, you know, I've 
7 been numbering witnesses as we go. The numbers that 
8 he assigns here have nothing to do with the order 
9 that they testified, so don't go by a witness 
10 number, you know, 43 is where, okay. 
11 The legend, I might as well pass it 
12 all out to you, but this helps you to recall who was 
13 in that Building Number 2, correct? 
14 A It does. 
15 Q All right. And on your little markings 
16 you have Number 25, who is Number 25? 
17 A It is, as I said, it is , and

All right. 
I've got a question. Those 
10 trees we see on the left side of the road, are they 
11 cut up six, seven foot off the ground if you are 
12 standing under there you can see through them? 
13 A You can walk under these trees without any 
14 problem. 
15 It is hard to tell from this 
16 photo. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So Image 1G, and we are 
19 going to conclude as soon as we get done with the 
20 first round of photos of the police car if that's 
21 okay. So, again, from the police vehicle now the 
22 photographer has turned a little more clockwise,

A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And so in those two photographs,

Q 
Yes, ma'am, yes. 
And then in 1G we see 
11 building, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
's 
13 Q And she said she was inside, but then I 
14 can't remember if she says she came outside, but 
15 from her building, if she were looking out a window, 
16 she could see the police car, correct? 
17 A Yes, ma'am.

1 Q And so from that location, what buildings 
2 do we see? 
3 A We again see Building 5 on the left-hand 
4 side. And further down in the background you can 
5 see a portion of Building 9. And then if we move 
6 over to the right-hand side of the street, you can 
7 see Building 17, a portion of Building 17 and a 
8 portion of building 16 and a small portion of 15. 
9 Q Okay. So based upon the images that we've 
10 seen so far, would somebody in Building 6, for 
11 example, be able to see the police car? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Building 6?

2 photograph this is, 1G is visible, so yes. 
3 Q Okay. And Image 1I. And again, from the 
4 police vehicle, what buildings and what can we see? 
5 A We're again looking at starting from left 
6 to right. We're looking at a portion of Building 
7 15, a portion of Building 16, Building 17, and then 
8 in the far right-hand side is Building 18. 
9 Q So in Image 1J, again, this is turning a 
10 little more clockwise. What building do we see in 
11 1J? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
We're primarily looking at Building 18. 
Okay. An in Building 18 we talk about 
14 that being where was? 
15 
16 
A 
Q

13 
right here? 
Yes, ma'am, yes. 
So that's something around full circle, 
MS. ALIZADEH: We'll conclude for today. 
14 What I would propose doing is that before next 
15 Friday, I'll mount all of these on a similar board 
16 and you understand the progression of the 
17 photographs. I don't know that it is necessary that 
18 we say what is seen. I think combined with using 
19 the board there, the legend and these photographs, 
20 but I will also ask Detective to return on 
21 Friday to finish. I maybe just have a wrap-up to do 
22 with him. Sheila will have some questions and then 
23 you --
24 MS. WHIRLEY: I just have one concluding 
25 question and that's it. Because I wasn't real clear

1 on something you said, I just wanted to make sure 
2 I'm clear. Would it be correct to say that you're 
3 not here today making a decision about probable 
4 cause or telling the grand jury there's no probable 
5 cause to charge Darren Wilson? 
6 A No, I am not, absolutely not. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: That would be a
