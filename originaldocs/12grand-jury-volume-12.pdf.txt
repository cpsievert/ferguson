GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let's see, Monday, 
Page 5 
6 October 13th, at 8:38 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh 
7 with the prosecutor's office, present is Sheila 
8 Whirley, all 12 grand jurors are present, as is 
9 , the court reporter. He's taking down what is 
10 being said and recording, audio recording. 
11 So for today, the first witness, let me 
12 back up a little bit and talk about scheduling. 
13 There was a question brought up, I think it might 
14 have been during a break we had last week about 
15 whether or not three days a week was helpful or if 
16 it was not very productive. And so Sheila and I 
17 have talked about it, as well as with some of our 
18 investigators. 
19 You know, as I mentioned to you that some 
20 of these people are reluctant to come in and that 
21 means going out and serving them subpoenas and even 
22 then, that's not a guarantee they're going to show 
23 up. 
24 We have been lucky so far. We have been 
25 able to get the people in, but, you know, every day

1 is going to be a challenge. We talked about it and 
2 first of all we felt that it was, it was going to be 
3 problematic for us to try to corral or wrangle up 
4 enough people to fill three days of your time. 
5 Neither Sheila nor I wants you sitting 
6 here. I know you have taken out from your personal 
7 lives and from your jobs and it is just really wrong 
8 for us to waste your time for you to sit here for 
9 two hours when we don't have anything scheduled for 
10 you or anything to put on. 
11 I think the two day a week is going to be 
12 better, hopefully we will use that time 
13 productively. 
14 Another reason for it is because we have 
15 doing the transcripts and we need those done 
16 as quickly as possible, because there's another 
17 investigation going on, that as you know, there's a 
18 federal investigation that's kind of parallel to 
19 ours. And doesn't just work when he's in the 
20 room with us, he goes home and he works to try to 
21 transcribe everything that is going on. And news to 
22 me, he mentioned the other day one hour of testimony 
23 may take him three hours to transcribe. 
24 He's working diligently to try to get 
25 these transcripts out. And when we have back to

1 back days, he's not able to work on the transcripts 
2 and the three days a week, we're finding he's not 
3 able to keep up with the transcripts the way we need 
4 them. 
5 Another reason is, you know, once this 
6 case is concluded and given to you for your 
7 deliberation, once, assuming you arrive at a 
8 decision, we don't want to have to delay that 
9 decision for two or three weeks while we're waiting 
10 for the transcripts to be done. 
11 So he's, , trying to do those as we 
12 go so we can keep up on those. So we felt that that 
13 was another reason why the two day a week would be 
14 better for just our purposes and getting this done 
15 efficiently and as quickly as possible. 
16 So I think the word went out to you last 
17 week after we canceled Thursday, that we also are 
18 canceling tomorrow, but we do have witnesses lined 
19 up for all day today, assuming they show up and then 
20 we have witnesses lined up for all day Thursday. 
21 Including, you know, we're going to hear statements 
22 when we're not having witnesses boom, boom, boom 
23 there will be times that you are listening to 
24 statements of witnesses that we anticipate that are 
25 going to be called.

1 So with that being said, thank you for, 
2 did they already do the rest of October? 
3 MS. WHIRLEY: How far, the 16th? 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Today, this week is today 
5 and Thursday. I don't know if we have the next two 
6 weeks actually written in stone. So if you guys, 
7 I've got a calendar in my office, but is that 
8 completed for the month. 
9 No jury duty on the 30th. 
10 We have it up through the 28th, that's three days. 
11 We need to talk about it. 
12 We need to confirm it. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah, why don't you all 
14 keep in mind two days a week is going to be the best 
15 way to go during your lunch break, and something you 
16 can kind of talk about your schedules and redo the 
17 calendar as you have. 
18 I will tell you that whatever days you 
19 pick, like I said, we are going to work with those. 
20 Doesn't matter to me, however, I do believe that it 
21 can be helpful for us if at least one of those days 
22 at least till 5:00. We've found that there are 
23 witnesses who have said, you know, well, I can't be 
24 here till 4:00 because my kids off the bus and blah, 
25 blah, blah.

1 We understand that these people are 
2 witnesses, you know. They happen to be, what they 
3 may feel now is at the wrong place at the wrong 
4 time. So, I'm trying my best, especially the ones 
5 that are cooperative, to work with them if they 
6 have, you know, work or child issues that, you know, 
7 we'll get you here, when does your son get off the 
8 bus. Okay. How about if we have the cab pick you 
9 up at 3:00, get you here at 3:30 that way we can get 
10 some of these people on. 
11 So when you do your schedule, I know that 
12 a lot of these days you have a 2:30 cutoff because 
13 of work and that's fine, but if there is a day 
14 during the week that you can go till 5:00, that 
15 might be a good second day for us because then we 
16 can maybe accommodate some witnesses that need to 
17 work later. 
18 Is there anything else that anybody had to 
19 bring up or talk about before we get started? 
20 All right. So today we are going to hear 
21 first We heard from his wife 
22 last Tuesday. And he was here 
23 with her, we didn't have time to get to him. You've 
24 already heard his recorded statement so we will call 
25 him as our first witness.

, she has a 
2 couple of statements that we will play before she 
3 testifies. One of them is very brief, like three 
4 minutes long, but the other one I have to tell you 
5 we just got because it was the result of a federal 
6 interview. 
7 I can't remember if it was done by the FBI 
8 or Department of Justice, but we have that, we have 
9 the recording of that, but I don't have a transcript 
10 of that. So we'll just listen to the recording of 
11 that statement before she testifies. 
12 And then we have a witness that's 
13 scheduled to be here at 1:00 in the afternoon. His 
14 name is He's made a number of 
15 statements as well. 
16 So after testifies, we'll 
17 go on with the statements, recording statement for 
18 the next witness, all right.

12 fireworks. And we looked up, saw the flashing red 
13 and blue lights. 
14 At this point I noticed the officer 
15 and a large black man, about my size, who appeared 
16 to be pointing a gun. I believe they were having a 
17 shootout at the time, I believe they were having a 
18 shootout. And the young black man appeared to be 
19 pointing in our direction and I was afraid for my

Okay. 
He appeared to be pointing directly at the

7 in the officer's direction and because of our point 
8 of view, he appeared to be pointing at us.

8 A Well, after seeing him and the officer and 
9 seeing him point and getting this impression that he 
10 was going to start shooting in our direction, uh, 
11 like that, Mr. Brown spun and started to run away 
12 down the street going this direction. 
13 Q Okay. So that would be east down 
14 Canfield? 
15 A Yes, down Canfield away from Florissant 
16 and away from our vehicle. At which point the

And so, and you said you thought you saw a 
4 glint in his hand, but did you see anything once he 
5 turned around and was running, did you notice 
6 anything in his hands? 
7 A I thought I saw him throw something or 
8 lose something when the officer wounded him and he, 
9 when he was wounded, he flung his arms out and spun 
10 back around. And I thought something might have 
11 flung from his hands. I wasn't certain at the time 
12 I gave my original statement. This was an 
13 impression that I got that I thought he may or may 
14 not have lost what he had in his hand.

16 Michael Brown, did he have a hat on?

3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then you said, you had said something 
4 about Michael Brown being wounded. 
5 A Yeah, when Mr. Brown was running away from 
6 the officer, one shot was fired. Mr. Brown 
7 staggered a little to the left and his arms went 
8 out. It looked to me like he was shot in the left

12

A

Did you see any blood coming from him?

13 you thought he was shot?

15 
A 
Q 
The way his body jerked. 
Okay. And so you say he spun around, so 
16 when he spun around, was he facing the officer at

19 the officer.

12 
A 
Q 
A 
No, no. 
Did she stop the ? 
No, we saw, we saw the police and the 
13 crowd and we turned onto, excuse me, we turned onto 
14 this side road here and drove around the back to 
15 house. I still can't remember which one of 
16 these two houses it is, but we drove around to avoid 
17 the scene.

Q 
A

Okay. So you took a left onto Coppercreek 
Right. 
You drove around Coppercreek Road, all the 
22 way to Stonefield Road? 
23 
24 
A

Uh-huh. 
All right. So fair to say then that you 
25 never got farther east than this intersection?

2 any closer than two blocks from the shooting. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A Like I said, I wasn't close enough to see 
5 any blood or to hear any verbal exchange between.

7 collapse you said and he landed in the street.

9 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
At that point, were you already on 
10 Coppercreek Court or 
11 A That's the point where we were looking for 
12 somewhere to turn off because we were like, we got 
13 to get out of here. Traffic had held us up at this 
14 bend. 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
So there were other cars? 
The street was blocked all the way down to 
17 this point here. The whole street was lined with

Q 
So there were other cars in front of your 
Yes, we were caught in traffic. 
And so I'm guessing, or I shouldn't guess, 
23 so when you were driving down here, did you 
24 immediately turn or was there a time where you were 
25 stuck in traffic or stopped in the road?

2 Mr. Brown hit the street, after he collapsed because 
3 as soon as he collapsed, we started looking for an 
4 exit. 
5 Q Okay. As you went left onto Coppercreek 
6 Road and traveled in this direction north and then 
7 east, could you see any more what was going on over 
8 there on Canfield Drive? 
9 A Uh, I didn't have any feel, I didn't have 
10 any clear line of sight. We saw people running and 
11 walking to and from, and we saw police cars coming 
12 from every different direction, but I couldn't see 
13 anything beyond that.

6 Q Okay. 
7 A I don't recall. My attention was focused 
8 on where the shots were coming from. 
9 Q And so when you say you saw Michael Brown 
10 turn around or now, you see him turn actually twice, 
11 correct? You first see him, he's looking toward the 
12 officer? 
13 A Right, he turned to run and he spun back 
14 around when he was wounded or like, I still think he 
15 was, I still think he was wounded when he was

8 fly from his hand when he spun, but it was an 
9 impression I got and since my original statement to 
10 the police, I said that I wasn't certain because of 
11 the distance, but I got the impression that 
12 something flew out of his hand when he was struck 
13 and spun around.

15 facing you or not?

21 people. They were all over the place. It is a 
22 neighborhood full of them.

4 Mr. Brown. I did not.

Q 
Correct. 
So if there was anything that happened 
10 prior to you coming around the bend, whether it was 
11 between the officer and Mike Brown or anyone else 
12 that was there, you didn't witness that? 
13 
14

Correct. 
And let me ask you because Sheila Whirley 
15 had asked you about whether or not you felt the

17 occurred prior to the officer running after Michael 
18 Brown, you have no idea what that was?

20

21 Michael Brown is running away from the officer and 
22 he fired at him. 
23

A Uh-huh.

11 throughout everything that Michael Brown spun 
12 around, do you feel that he spun around on his own

14 being shot. 
15 A The bullet, the impact of being shot, uh, 
16 certainly appeared to have started him turning. And 
17 whether he continued of his own volition or not, I'm 
18 not certain. It looked like the impact started to 
19 spin him around and when he completed the turn, he 
20 was facing us again and came back toward the

17 Brown was a big guy, and do you think that anything 
18 to do with the threat towards the police officer 
19 because he was a big guy? 
20 A It's possible, it's possible. I don't 
21 believe the officer was as tall. My impression was 
22 that the officer was perhaps 3 or 4 inches shorter 
23 than Mr. Brown. I'm not certain how tall either one 
24 of them are, but I got the impression that he was 
25 about half a head shorter.

Q 
And so was this then as a part of an area 
Yes, it was. 
And just to be clear, so a canvas is 
7 basically you're going door to door and knocking on 
8 doors and stopping people when they pull into the 
9 parking lot, get out of their cars, asking them if 
10 they saw anything or know anything; is that right?

That's correct.

1 A He initially heard the shots, he was 
2 sitting on the couch when he got up, he heard the 
3 shots, he went up and looked out his window and he 
4 had a partial view of Canfield Drive from his 
5 apartment window. 
6 Q All right. And what did he tell you who, 
7 if anybody, did he say he saw when he looked out the 
8 window? 
9 A He saw who he now knows to be Michael 
10 Brown in the street walking away from the apartment 
11 building, kind of walking going down the street. 
12 Q Okay. There is a laser pointer in front 
13 of you, you were gesturing with your hands toward

1 A His apartment window would have been right 
2 here. He would have seen Mr. Brown walking this 
3 direction. (indicating) 
4 Q So he would have been facing west on 
5 Canfield Drive walking in a westerly direction if 
6 this is west? 
7 A That's correct. 
8 Q Okay. And did he see any police officers 
9 from that vantage point? 
10 
11 
12 do? 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Initially, no. 
And what did he say he saw Michael Brown 
He heard the first couple of shots, three 
14 shots, went to his window, looked out and saw 
15 Mr. Brown walking westward down Canfield Drive. He 
16 heard approximately six more shots, saw Mr. Brown 
17 grab his torso with one hand and had another hand 
18 up, drop to his knee and fall to the ground. 
19 Q And so when you interviewed 
20 let me ask you this. Had he just like gotten up out 
21 of bed or was he intoxicated or under the influence 
22 of something that you thought might make it, might 
23 affect his ability to recall what he told you? 
24 A No, he answered the door, he was alert and 
25 willing to answer any questions.

1 Q Okay. And so he told you that he saw 
2 Michael Brown walking away from him. In other 
3 words, away from where he was in his apartment. And 
4 then in the direction where he would have been 
5 walking west on Canfield Drive? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q Okay. Did you ever go back and actually 
8 clarify that with him as far as whether or not he 
9 saw Michael Brown moving in the direction, moving in 
10 that direction or whether or not Michael Brown was 
11 standing still? 
12 A We clarified that with him at least three 
13 times during the interview just to make sure that we 
14 understood what he was saying, and the other agent 
15 made sure what he was saying. 
16 He was very clear that he saw 
17 Mr. Brown, he now knows it's Mr. Brown, at the time 
18 he did not know who it was, walking, walking west on 
19 Canfield. 
20 Q And this was after he had heard a series 
21 of gunshots, correct? 
22 A Correct. 
23 Q And then he observed him, he heard another 
24 series of gunshots, did he tell you if he could see

1 A He could not see who was firing the

3 Q And then did he say he saw Michael Brown, 
4 you said, clutching his torso or holding his torso 
5 and then one hand up. I can't recall which hand, 
6 you demonstrated. I think you demonstrated your 
7 right hand up? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's how he demonstrated it. 
Okay. And then he went down to one knee 
10 and collapsed in the street? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Did he tell you then he saw a police 
13 officer after that? 
14 A After Michael Brown had fallen to the 
15 ground, he saw an officer approach Michael Brown 
16 from the west and approach Michael Brown. 
17 Q And so the officer was coming from the 
18 west, was he walking east on Canfield then?

1 living room during the encounter, during the shots. 
2 So we asked her specifically, she was in the 
3 kitchen, we asked her specifically if she saw 
4 anything. She said no. We asked her why, she said 
5 well, by the time she had gotten into the living 
6 room by the window, it was over. 
7 She was in the bedroom at the time, 
8 he had summoned her into the living room and at that

10 MS. WHIRLEY: You gave her an opportunity 
11 to tell you whether or not she saw something and 
12 she, in fact, told you she did not?

15 else have questions?

1 Any other questions for the agent? 
2 Did you look out 
3 the window that they looked out of, did you see the 
4 area where Michael Brown was, was he able to see 
5 what he reported seeing? 
6 A Yes. That street was not completely 
7 visible from his apartment. You could only see 
8 parts of it. So as far as what he was telling us, 
9 what he could see, I would believe would be 
10 accurate.

13 
A You couldn't see the whole thing.

1 present, myself, Sheila Whirley and the court 
2 reporter , and we just had a small break after 
3 a witness testimony. And I want to make sure we put 
4 on the record that there was some questions that 
5 were asked after the witness testified about some 
6 dates and when certain witnesses were interviewed. 
7 And I think what we discussed and kind of clarified 
8 is that according to what you've heard so far, 
9 who is the fiancee of , was 
10 interviewed by the County Police on August 9th, the 
11 day that Michael Brown was killed. 
12 And that then Agent and his partner 
13 went to their apartment and as a part of an area 
14 canvas with no specific purpose of looking for 
15 anyone in particular other than any witness that saw 
16 this. 
17 And that he then interviewed 
18 on the 16th of August. He also said that 
19 was present in the apartment at the time and 
20 said she didn't see anything. 
21 And then you all have also heard from a 
22 statement that was interviewed by the 
23 FBI, like on September 30th or something, and that 
24 during that interview she described what she says on 
25 the 30th she saw.

1 So there was some question about whether 
2 or not the FBI knew that the FBI, meaning Agent 
3 and Agent , whether they knew that 
had been talked to by agent 
partner, and/or whether or not agent 
and his 
was 
4

6 aware that had been interviewed by the 
7 County Police prior to their interview of her. 
8 And what I explained to you is, to the 
9 best of my knowledge and guess would be that they 
10 did not know of the other interviews that had taken 
11 place, however, I will tell you that's only until 
12 the best guess on my part based upon my 
13 understanding of how the investigation was going at 
14 that time. 
15 The FBI was working independently of the 
16 County Police at that time. And the County Police 
17 were not involved in that canvas that took place on 
18 the 16th. 
19 Originally, there was talk that was, they 
20 were going to do the canvas together, the County 
21 Police and the FBI. And then the FBI said, no, we 
22 are going to do the canvas just on our own. So the 
23 County Police are not a part of that canvas. 
24 And so I can clarify this with Detective 
25 and, of course, Detective will

3 It is my belief and thought is that 
4 probably agent was not aware that 
5 had been interviewed by County Police when 
6 he went to go see, he knocked on their door on the 
7 16th. And then also I would have to verify with

11 
Agent and , it is my guess that they 
were not aware that Agent had seen 
Agent 
and had spoken to her on the 16th because 
did not put that in his report because 
12 he, according to him, and I discussed this with him, 
13 since said she didn't see anything, he didn't 
14 include that. It is like he just didn't. 
15 Whether he should or not is not for me to 
16 say, but he just didn't. So I don't think that

19 
Agent and Agent

3 When I said , what I was thinking of 
4 for him to testify about the lack of information 
5 flowing back and forth at that time because he was 
6 from the get-go, Detective has been in charge 
7 of the investigation, but of course, he's only in 
8 charge of the county officers. But as the primary 
9 detective, he was talking to the FBI, but again, he 
10 could clarify this for you, but I believe that at 
11 that time on the 16th, there wasn't a lot of back 
12 and forth going on. Sharing of information so to 
13 speak between the County and the FBI about who had 
14 been talked to and what they said and the FBI did 
15 this area canvas on their own. 
16 It was their desire that the County not be 
17 involved. They wanted to have their own independent 
18 investigation so they said we're going to do this, 
19 we don't want County coming with us or being 
20 involved in that for whatever reason. 
21 So you're right, it was that 
22 did the interview with

1 interviews, so how do they determine like, I mean, 
2 it is freshly on their mind on the 9th or three days 
3 after, but then when you come behind like weeks 
4 later, how beneficial is that? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, that's going to be up 
6 for you all to talk about when you begin your 
7 deliberations. If there's a difference in a 
8 statement that's given closer to the time and then 
9 there's a statement that was done after that, how 
10 long after that, what are the circumstances of the 
11 statement, what about, you know, these are all 
12 things for you to consider. If there are 
13 differences, why are there differences, you know. 
14 Could it be that the first statement was 
15 done because it is brief and then as you know, the 
16 FBI has come along and Department of Justice have 
17 done subsequent interviews that seem to be longer in 
18 duration. Are they being more detailed? These are 
19 all things that you are going to have to decide for 
20 yourself. If there are differences, what do you 
21 make of those differences. 
22 So now we're going to listen to a recorded 
23

statement of 
we've heard from a

who testified that

1 confused by our asking it, feel free to stop us 
2 because we are going to assume that you understood 
3 when you answer it. And sometimes we trip over our 
4 words and don't make sense anyway, so don't think 
5 that you are insulting us by correcting us. 
6 MS. Okay. 
7 And all your answers need to be 
8 out loud because it is being recorded. There may be 
9 a transcript made. So if you nod your head, I may 
10 ask is that a yes or is that a no. 
11 
12 
MS. Yes. 
So it is totally normal to do 
13 that. If I do that, I'm not doing that to you to be 
14 rude, okay? 
15 And just referenced that you just 
16 listened to your statement is about 8 and a half 
17 minutes long. We have a transcript that you are 
18 following along with. Do you remember hearing that 
19 statement and is it fair as much as you remember 
20 with what you said? 
MS. Yes. 21 
22 Okay. And so we don't want to 
23 really make you rehash everything, we just wanted to 
24 ask you some follow-up questions from it. You know,

1 know you only saw, you know, the beginning and the 
2 end, we don't want you to think that we're looking 
3 for anything and everything possible, just what you, 
4 yourself, know, okay. 
5 So, therefore, we just have some follow-up 
6 things for you. And one of the reasons we wanted 
7 you to listen to your statement is because it has 
8 been seven and a half weeks and as you know, this 
9 has been on the news and people talk a lot about it, 
10 but our goal is to find out what you, yourself, 
11 know, not what you may have heard on the news. 
12 So a lot of times it helps to refresh your 
13 memory and kind of separate out what you said at the 
14 time and what you, yourself, versus what you may 
15 have heard based upon the news or the police report, 
16 does that make sense? 
17 
18 
MS. Yes. 
Okay. Also, we know it is 
19 late, you came here from work. At any point you 
20 think I've had enough, even though you're in the 
21 FBI, feel free to say I've had enough, I don't want 
22 to talk any more being, okay?

24 
MS. Okay. 
This is entirely voluntary. We 
25 certainly don't want to force you to be here.

1 Basically we are just looking for what happened and 
2 the truth. 
3 So we have to tell you as I tell everybody 
4 that, it's a crime to make false statements to 
5 federal agents. So we always say people are very 
6 honest people. If you're going to exaggerate or 
7 lie, you are better off not saying anything at all 
8 then like a lie, okay? 
9 
10 
MS. Okay. 
And so basically, like I said 
11 we just want to know what happened. If you assume 
12 something or you're guessing at something, or you're 
13 talking about what other people heard, that's fine 
14 as long as you let us know that you are assuming,

We just really want to know

20 remember it. If you don't know the answer, I don't

6 MS. Urn, actually, like I said, as 
7 I was behind the police officer, I noticed that he 
8 did stop because I was directly behind him, so I had 
9 to slow down also. 
10 Okay. 
11 MS. In the process of up to two 
12 young men walking, Michael Brown and the friend with 
13 the dreads walking down the street, he did stop.

9 Before the car started rocking 
10 back and forth, did you see any sort of interaction 
11 between the guy with the dreads, Michael Brown and 
12 the police officer? 
13 MS. Actually, I did not because 
14 how my car sits and how tall the truck was, so I 
15 didn't see directly what was going on inside. 
16 So from your vantage point as 
17 soon as you stopped, what's the first thing that you 
18 remember seeing?

20 just stopping.

9 out. 
10 So the recording can't pick

12 proceeded to go, you we are taking about the guy

7 Okay.

At this point is when you start 
3 ducking; is that right? 
4 MS. Right. After I heard the 
5 first shot and I see Michael Brown jump out of the 
6 car, yes, ma'am, I was terrified. When they start 
7 running because actually, they ran past my car, so I 
8 didn't know what was going on.

10 running past your car and you just heard gunshots

19 the time that the boys started running past you and 
20 the police officer? 
21 MS. There actually was. Just 
22 because we was trying to get out of the truck at the 
23 time. So once we took off running, once Michael 
24 Brown and the guy with the dreads took off running, 
25 that's when I noticed the police comes out.

4 open, he had it slung open. He was on the curb, but 
5 he had -- he crawled. You could tell that he 
6 crawled. He was in the car and he just basically

So I'm going to show you, this is a copy

15 this all you want. I'm just getting to a point 
16 where you start talking about, oh about halfway, a 
17 little more than halfway down. You are talking 
18 about having seen him get shot at the car and then 
19 you said after he did that, I looked up and now by 
20 this time, I'm looking up because I'm terrified. 
21 Now, I'm looking up in my rear view 
22 mirror, that's when I see the young man. Well, he 
23 already ran past and then a police officer ran past. 
24 So when I looked up, I saw the young man turn, he 
25 was facing the police officer, he was towards the

3 A Uh-huh.

5 saw the young man's face?

11

And you say, in my rear view mirror? 
And he says, the officer says okay. 
And then you saw, and I saw I heard 
just three more gunshots, I don't know if it was 
or three, I know it dot dot dot, and I think you 
14 making the sound of gunshot, right? Dot dot dot. 
15 And then I saw when the young man just hit the 
two 
are 
16 ground. When he hit the ground, I just got terror, 
17 I mean, I was just stunned. And I never seen 
18 nothing like that in my life. So I just end up 
19 proceeding to get away. 
20 In the process of me getting away, 
21 another truck came to me and almost hit me head-on.

1 was an exciting thing that you saw. And your

3 A (Nods head.) 
4 Q So you didn't mention to Detective 
5 when he talked to you that Michael Brown had his 
6 hands up? 
7 A Okay. 
8 Q And he asked you at the end of your 
9 statement is there anything else that you can think 
10 of that, you know, that you saw that's important.

18 over time. Something that I saw, if I go to see a 
19 movie, I remember the movie better right after I see 
20 it than a year later. I might not remember who 
21 starred in it or all the details about it, and I 
22 know we're not talking about a year later, but do 
23 you understand what I'm talking about, memories 
24 changing?

say that I was 
9 overexcited. In my mind, my mind was gone, like I 
10 said, I have never seen nothing like that in my 
11 life. So, therefore, that was probably something 
12 that I didn't mention at the time. But I saw what I

11 stop, just a sudden stop. 
12 It wasn't real aggressive 
13 backwards then where the tires were spinning?

7 From your 
8 perspective, would you say the officer used, I'll

10 would you say the officer used in this situation?

Okay. 
When you 
11 
12 
13 
14 sat down with Detective , is it safe to say he 
15 never asked you where Michael Brown's hands were? 
16 A Correct, that's correct. He never really 
17 asked me that question. 
18 In 
19 answer, dovetailing off question, 
20 if I heard you correctly, you said that the officer 
21 did use excessive force; is that correct?

23 Can you tell me why you 
24 feel that way. 
25 A Actually, I think he used excessive force

1 because it was after he chased him down, that's 
2 where my actions come in, when he chased after him, 
3 that's what I mean by excessive force because he was 
4 running away from him. 
5 Okay. So after he ran 
6 away from him and then the second shots, or the 
7 second series of shots, okay. And are you saying 
8 after that there shouldn't have been any more shots? 
9 A Actually, I'm saying once he ran away and 
10 got a nice little distance, there shouldn't have 
11 been any more shots. 
12 Okay. 
13 Just to clarify 
14 one question, when gave his statement to the 
15 County, they asked him about after Wilson had moved 
16 past the car and brought up that there were 
17 two or three, up to four cars behind you. They 
18 started lining up after that, but you are saying 
19 there were no cars behind you? 
20 
21

I have a

1 force and you said that after he ran away there 
2 should have been no more shots. What do you think 
3 should have happened, do you think he should have 
4 let Michael Brown just run away? You didn't hear 
5 anything being said like stop or you didn't hear 
6 what was going on. 
7 A Halt, none of that. 
8 You didn't see the 
9 tussle, so you don't know what happened. Do you 
10 feel like the police officer should have just let 
11 Michael Brown run away and get away and not try to 
12 stop him even if he did break the law? 
13 A In somewhat, and the reason why I say that 
14 is because if he would have let him get away, if he 
15 was shot at any time, he would have been found. Had 
16 the police have swarmed in, they would have got him 
17 even if he would have run, even if he would have got 
18 away, they would have captured him. 
19 So you feel like he would 
20 have gotten away and then they would have captured 
21 him and he would have been arrested, not killed? 
22

1 clips and the third clip was a clip with Anderson

3 it occurred. It looks like 8/12 for the first

5 second and September the lOth for the third. So 
6 that will conclude that from Grand Jury Exhibit 
7 Number 39. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to point out 
9 that there is a fourth clip on there that you can 
10 see. If you can see the file up there. That clip 
11 is basically some attorneys and some news reporters 
12 kind of commenting on the statements that were made 
13 and again, it is really not evidence and we don't 
14 really, I don't feel it is helpful to have other 
15 persons' perspectives what they think these 
16 statements mean. So we did not play that last clip 
17 for you. It really isn't a statement of a witness.

3 it is. I have a clock on my phone, but I don't

Michael had just a little bit of marijuana

7 that? And he just said, no, we're going to go to 
8 the store and get some skins or a blunt or something 
9 is what he said. 
10 Q Okay. So now when you say he had a little 
11 marijuana, describe for me exactly what you saw?

2 Where I thought he was just bored up 
3 there in his apartment, heard me down there and 
4 wanted to come down and just talk. 
5 Q Why do you think that, why do you say 
6 A Whenever he would talk and give me an

16 up over here, and started walking over here to 
17 get the Bobcat.

19 to come back and take three little scoops out. I

Could have been a women?

2 that I could look at that wasn't like the other one. 
3 This is the one that talked first. I mean, I seen 
4 this twice so. 
5 Q All right. So after you say you saw 
6 Michael turn around and he had his hands in the 
7 manner that you demonstrated and he said okay, okay, 
8 okay, okay, several times and then you see these 
9 three officers, are they coming down the street? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q And how are they moving, are they are 
12 running, walking? 
13 A Pretty swift. They weren't running, but 
14 it was a pretty quick walk. 
15 Q And you said that the officer that was in 
16 front had his weapon drawn and you were kind of with 
17 your motion with your hands like this somewhat? 
18 (indicating) 
19 A Yeah, he was pointing it down towards the 
20 street until he got within about 10 feet of Michael. 
21 Q Did these three officers continue to move 
22 in Michael's direction? 
23 A The two slowed down when he started 
24 shooting. 
25 Q When who started shooting, the officer

emptied, the 
7 other guy pulled his gun for probably a couple of 
8 seconds until Michael fell. Once he fell then they 
9 put it away and whisked the other guy out of there. 
10 Q Okay. So now as you say the other 
11 officers were moving swiftly toward Michael and 
12 Michael had turned around. 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Did Michael move in a direction? 
He was still catching his balance from 
16 standing up and he was coming towards him, but it 
17 wasn't like he was running towards him. 
18 Q Okay. How many steps did he take towards 
19 the officers? 
20 A By the time the shot was, I'd say about 
21 four, maybe five to catch up on his balance. 
22 Q And was he, when you said that he was kind 
23 of catching himself, was he, you kind of had hands 
24 up, but you were kind of going forward, was he 
25 falling at that point?

1 A No, he was just. I think he was a big kid 
2 and was coming up. I thought that he had been shot, 
3 so I don't know what it feels like to be shot. So 
4 maybe wherever he got shot was kind of bothering him 
5 too. He wasn't really falling, he was just --
6 Q He was moving towards the officers? 
7 A He was moving towards the officer. 
8 Q Okay. And you said about how many steps, 
9 three or four? 
10 A Yeah, there was like no gap between his 
11 heel and toe, he was just kind of staggering 
12 forward. 
13 Q And then what happened after he moved 
14 three or four steps? 
15

17 
A 
Q

Then the officers got up to him. 
What does that mean? 
Well, by that time the officer was there, 
18 as soon as the officer got there, I didn't hear the 
19 officer say anything because he was yelling okay and 
20 then just pulled up and started shooting. 
21 Q So the officer you're talking about who 
22 pulled up and started shooting was the one who had 
23 his gun drawn?

1 you saw him starting to shoot? 
2 A About 10 foot when he started and about 
3 five to seven feet when he ended. 
4 Q How many, now this is after those first 
5 two shots, this is the second? 
6 A This would have been the third, fourth, 
7 fifth, sixth. 
8 Q Okay. How many shots do you think at that 
9 time? 
10 A I think it was seven, and the reason I 
11 think that is most officers carry guns with nine 
12 bullets. So if there was two to start with and then 
13 he emptied his gun, that would have been seven. 
14 Q Okay. So, now, this is where I don't want 
15 you to get into assuming things.

1 previous statement where you said you saw his shirt 
2 and that you saw the bullets going through him 
3 because you saw his shirt pop or something like 
4 that. Did you think that you saw bullets coming out 
5 of his back? 
6 A That's what I thought. 
7 Q Okay. Do you think that today? 
8 A I don't know what I think today. Because 
9 I still, I've never seen somebody get shot before 
10 and when I watch it on TV they make all of these 
11 crazy movements when they get shot. He didn't make 
12 one single movement. It was like the bullets went 
13 right through him and he didn't know they were going 
14 through him. 
15 Q Okay. But did you see bullets come out of 
16 his back? 
17 A I didn't see the bullets. I seen what

14 he started to move backwards, did he walk backward 
15 or did he turn around and go backward?

17 the other guy just took his gun out and then they 
18 went out of sight. I didn't see anything else after 
19 that until we put all of our stuff away. 
20 Q So you said he might have taken a couple 
21 of steps while he was firing, moving forward?

23 away, but by the time he got finished, it was like 
24 eight to seven, seven to eight feet away from him,

3 shooting 8/9/14. 
4 A Witness cop shooting 8/9/14, 12:00. 
5 Talked with victim for 25 or 30 minutes about God. 
6 He says the Lord Jesus Christ will help me with my, 
7 through my problems. And he said he was going to 
8 the store and he would be back. 
9 Then I heard a pop, thought nothing, 
10 then I heard another and looked over and saw the 
11 victim stumbling and running through gunfire, 
12 figured that he was running from who had the gun. 
13 Then he threw his hands up and yelled 
14 okay, okay, okay, and the police officer who said 
15 nothing emptied his gun into the guy. I believe 
16 seven more at close range. 
17 What happened before the first two, I 
18 don't know, but from when, from when he said that he 
19 would be back, I would say 25 to 30 minutes, that's 
20 what I changed when I talked to 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
A

Minutes passed before shots fired.

15 know, if you don't print that stuff like that, it 
16 wouldn't be, that's when Shirley wanted to keep

Shirley, meaning the gal from Channel 2? 
Yeah. 
So do you think the media has kind of 
21 inflamed this? 
22 A I believe it has. That's just what I 
23 believe and I believe that on my own. 
24 Q Now, when you contacted the media, it was 
25 because you thought they were getting some things

2 A From what I saw they were saying stuff 
3 that probably shouldn't have been said or wasn't 
4 right. There is something that you shouldn't say. 
5 Q Like, for example? 
6 A I can't remember an example off the top of 
7 my head, but they tried to get one out of me today. 
8 Just things, you know, you shouldn't say. 
9 Q What about have you seen any of the other 
10 people who were there said they saw this, like 
11 Dorian Johnson, 
12 A I only talked to one guy who said he saw 
13 it on one day I went out there. I can't think of

5 ever there he came up and said he lived there 
6 years, he's ready to go because the kids are moving 
7 in and the kids don't have any respect. 
8 Q What about anyone else, other than media, 
9 have you talked to anyone else about what you saw? 
10 A Other than my family and a couple of 
11 friends. 
12 Q I'm asking specifically about Michael 
13 Brown's family? 
14 A I talked to his mom. That Shirley gave 
15 her my number, they called me. It wasn't her mom 
16 that called, it was the name comes to mind. I 
17 don't even know if that was his name. She said hi 
18 on there and the first thing --
19 Q Let's back up. How is it that you were in 
20 touch with Michael Brown's mother? 
21 A Shirley Washington said she wondered if I 
22 wanted to talk to her. I said I don't know, I don't 
23 see why I would have to. 
24 Q So how is it that you spoke to her, was 
25 this in person or on the phone?

Okay. So you were speaking to a woman on 
9 the phone and you were told that that was Michael 
10 Brown's mother? 
11 A She asked about Michael and I told her, we 
12 talked for a little while and then she broke down. 
13 I said this is going to be hard. We'll just talk 
14 later when all of this blows over. The other guy 
15 started talking a little bit. I just said I'm going 
16 to have to get going.

No, I said we'll talk later after all of

19 to make her cry and go over the whole thing. I was 
20 just going to tell her that I thought Michael was a 
21 good kid. That's what I told Shirley, I'll do that. 
22 I don't really want to get into details.

1 here, is that fair to say? 
2 A I just want this all to be over with. I 
3 want to be left alone after this day. 
4 Q And I told you that I'm not accusing you 
5 or anything, or you're not in any trouble for 
6 anything; is that right?

8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Right. 
Do you believe me when I told that? 
I believe you when you told me that. 
So my question to you is, is that when you 
11 initially talked to the police the first couple of 
12 times, you didn't say anything in those first two 
13 statements about Michael having the marijuana that 
14 you saw that he had and that he was going to go to 
15 the store and buy a blunt or something of that 
16 nature. You didn't mention that or a conversation 
17 about wax or anything like that. Why did you not 
18 mention that when you first talked to the police? 
19 A I don't know. The FBI asked me that 
20 question too. I probably didn't feel that I needed 
21 to stick him into the ground what little bit of 
22 marijuana he had, I didn't think that was that much. 
23 Q So you just didn't think that was a big 
24 deal or relevant? 
25 A I didn't think so.

And you thought that that might make him 
2 kind of shed a bad light on him after he passed and 
3 you didn't see the point of doing that? 
4 A I didn't think of it that way. I just 
5 didn't think throwing more gas on the fire was going

8 Q Okay. , is there anything that you 
9 can think of that I haven't asked or that you think 
10 is important that this grand jury should know to 
11 understand what happened that day?

13 something or you know something, let me know. Not 
14 that -- it all just happened so fast, it is like in 
15 and out and gone. And then all of the sudden all 
16 the chaos with people calling and, you know, I 
17 believe the first couple days I was more in shock 
18 than anything. And then going home and arguing with 
19 the wife because I should have just not said 
20 anything. 
21 Q And you believe that you should have not 
22 said anything?

11 through him, I could see his shirt popping back. 
12 What did that mean to you, did that mean they were 
13 going through his back or popping back in the front 
14 or what did that mean? 
15 A I just assumed when he was shooting that 
16 close they were going out the back and it seemed 
17 like everything, but within two or three seconds, or 
18 whatever, four seconds, it was all done and over and 
19 they were heading the other way. So I just assumed

23 the first time you saw him, until the shooting?

1 clothes? 
2 A I don't even remember what color his shirt 
3 was. I just remember the shorts were gray. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So now, if I were to tell 
5 you that, you know, of course we know what shorts he 
6 had on when he was shot because, of course, those 
7 clothes have been seized. If I were to tell you 
8 that his shorts had pockets in them, does that 
9 change your opinion of when you said he couldn't of 
10 had a weapon because he didn't have any pockets. 
11 A That wouldn't change my theory on that 
12 because they were those really light, you know, soft 
13 towel looking shorts, I believe. Where there is no 
14 thread to tie them. I didn't look in there, but I 
15 wouldn't think you could put a gun in there. I 
16 don't have a pistol, I don't own a gun. 
17 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Do you know what cargo 
18 shorts are, khakis, cargo? 
19 A I don't think that's what he was wearing. 
20 He might have been, I mean really, I don't think 
21 that's what he was wearing. 
22 Q Okay. But when you saw him, and trust me, 
23 I'm not saying he had a weapon, we now know he 
24 didn't have a weapon, my question is, when you saw 
25 him, you just said that he didn't have a weapon

1 because he didn't have any shorts with pockets in 
2 them? 
3 A Oh, when you ask if he had a weapon, I 
4 would say no because I don't think those shorts 
5 would be able to hold it. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A But then again, you know. 
8 Q But that's an assumption on your part, 
9 right? 
10 A Okay, all right. I see where you are 
11 going, I understand. 
12 Q So we don't know, and like you said, we 
13 don't know what happened before you saw him run past 
14 that building into your view, correct? 
15 A Yes. So then I just say, I didn't 
16 physically see a weapon on him. 
17 
18 
Q Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So when the officer, when 
19 Michael Brown turned around and was staggering as 
20 you said, moving toward the officer, did it appear 
21 to you that he was charging the officer? 
22 A No, it appears to me that he was just 
23 catching his balance. That's when I thought, where 
24 I assumed again that he had been hit with the second 
25 shot, which I don't know.

8 happened. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
At the time, no, but I don't know what 
I mean, when you saw him? 
When I saw him, it didn't appear that way.

16 You 
17 mentioned in your statements that when you spoke 
18 with Michael, that you thought he was mentally slow. 
19 And you said you observed that by the way that he 
20 spoke, he spoke very softly. 
21 A Yes. 
22 As he spoke, he raised his 
23 head back and fluttered his eyelids and stuff like 
24 that. Have you ever had the opportunity to deal 
25 with someone that might be labeled or diagnosed as

1 autistic? 
2 A No, I have never met anybody autistic 
3 other than on TV or something. I don't know what 
4 autism is actually really. 
5 Q The reason why I ask is, I have personal 
6 experience with it and sometimes when you come 
7 across people or adults that have autism, they tend 
8 to do repetitious kind of actions. So you 
9 mentioned, you mentioned that kind of brought it to 
10 mind when he spoke, he raised his head back and 
11 fluttered his eyelids. I'm assuming, since you 
12 brought that up, it was more than once that he did 
13 that? 
14 A Every time he talked. 
15 Q Every time he talked? 
16 A Except for when he was walking to the 
17 store. He might of, but I didn't pick up on it when 
18 him and the other guy went walking away, I didn't 
19 pick up on it.

1 Michael Brown? 
2 A I didn't even know who he was, he just 
3 walked up and started watching me working. 
4 This is first time you two 
5 met, is that my understanding? 
6 A Yes. 
7 You had 
8 opportunity to see a person just a few minutes, 10 
9 minutes, 15 minutes ago, take marijuana or some 
10 other drug in his system, you happen to see sometime 
11 in person like that? 
12 
13 
A I didn't hear. 
A person who has drugs, 
14 he use drugs, marijuana, cocaine or maybe --
15 A Do I know people that used that? 
16 You see people who use 
17 that, say 15, 20 minutes after they use the drug, 
18 you see people like that? 
19 A I know people like that. 
20 What do you see in that 
21 person? 
22 A They're just high. I don't know how to 
23 explain high, they're just 
24 Usually a slow person,

1 to 45 minutes they take the drug, he get high, but 
2 it will walking slow, talking slow, move his eyes 
3 up, sometimes you look like a zombie? 
4 A Some people, I would say it all hits 
5 everybody a little different. 
6 Thank you. 
7 I'm 
8 going to go on there. I have seen people that have 
9 been high on marijuana and this is not meant to be 
10 funny, sometimes it is hard to tell the difference 
11 between high and being slow because that's what it 
12 does, it slows you down, it makes you mellow. Could 
13 that have been, you assumed he was slow because you 
14 didn't know whether or not he had smoked, was there 
15 something that made you think he was slow versus 
16 high? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
A 
No, I just didn't feel he was high. 
Okay. 
At the time. 
20 It was just the 
21 impression you got at the time, he was slow and not 
22 high at the time? 
23 A I mean, he may have been, I would just 
24 assume, I'm assuming that he was slow too, but 
25 that's the first impression that I got from him is

1 that he was slow and came outside, seen me working 
2 and wanted to talk to somebody. 
3 Okay. And I have a 
4 question about you said in your statement on the 
5 18th of August that you were working at and 
6 then today you indicated that you were working 
7 and So I'm wanting to verify where you were 
8 when you saw this? 
9 A When he got back with the machine, he 
10 started right here, he dug the first scoop, took the 
11 second scoop right there and the third one right 
12 over here, and then got off, parked the machine and 
13 
14 
15 
my truck was parked right there. (indicating) 
And where were you? 
A After the first pop, I was right there 
16 cleaning the loose stuff out of the hole. 
17 So you don't think you 
18 
19 
20 
21 
ever were working at ?

Right. 
A I already cleaned that out while he was 
22 working right there.

24 working there to begin with and then you moved over

1 A All we were doing, he would come through 
2 with the bucket, pop it in the ground and scoop a 
3 little out. I clean the loose stuff out and we add 
4 a little piece of pipe to it to get it further away 
5 from the building. 
6 Can I ask you how fast 
7 those Mustangs go? 
8 A Five to seven miles an hour. 
9 How far is it from where 
10 you were to where his truck was? 
11 A He parked here and he had to go out this 
12 way. I don't know how far that is. (indicating) 
13 A little bit ago you said 
14 maybe two or three minutes. If it goes at the very 
15 most 5 miles an hour, it would have been probably at 
16 least five minutes, right? 
A I don't know. 17 
18 Okay. That's okay, I'm 
19 just trying figure out what happened. 
20 A I know by the time he got over there with 
21 the machine, I already had the pipes out of my truck 
22 and put away so he could just park that and get 
23 right into his car. 
24 I have another question. 
25 You said, no, this is in the very first interview.

1 No, he had his hands up, he was just kind of taking 
2 the shots, this is on page four. And then they 
3 asked, and once he was empty, then the bad cop 
pulled his gun and just staggered forward and 
dropped to his face.

5 
6 In this interview you say you saw Michael 
7 drop to his face, but today you say didn't see, you 
8 saw him leave, you didn't see Michael drop to his 
9 face, correct? 
10 A I saw Michael laying on the ground, so I 
11 assume that he fell on his face. 
12 So you didn't see him 
13 drop to his face? 
14 A I didn't see him fall. When I came around 
15 and gave that kid a card, I could see him laying on 
16 his face. 
17 When you said I think he 
18 was dead on his feet and just fell forward, that was 
19 an assumption?

1 walking forward and stopped and at one point you 
2 said 8 feet and another one you said about 5 feet 
3 and then shot him. 
4 In the media interview and today, you 
5 mention that the cop had his gun drawn and was 
6 walking backward. I'm just trying to figure out was 
7 me stopped? 
8 A He had it down and was walking toward him. 
9 He started shooting at about 10 feet or so. 
10 Okay. 
11 A By the time he stopped shooting was about 
12 6, 7 feet, 8 feet. 
13 When you talked here and 
14 said he was backing up. 
15 A I was doing a lot of assuming apparently 
16 from what I'm learning today. 
17 I don't blame you, I 
18 assume all the time, but I'm just --
19 A When he stopped shooting, that's when they 
20 started backing up. 
21 He started backing up 
22 after he stopped shooting? 
23 A After the shots and then I never heard 
24 another shot after that.

2 five of the August 18th interview. You said I think 
3 when I first seen him stumbling, fall, come out of 
4 that building, what building, I'm confused? 
5 A When he come out of the building, come out 
6 from behind the building. By the time the second
