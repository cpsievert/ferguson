He rode with Lieutenant Colonel

You all arrived at the hospital? 
Yes. 
He's, I imagine, treated? 
Yes. If I can just back up one step. 
Sure. 
Before we had departed, the Ferguson 
12 Police Department, Officer Wilson did remove his 
94 
13 uniform shirt and draped it over a chair, which that 
14 was essentially in Detective right 
15 next to his desk. So that's kind of where the three

2 Q So Officer Wilson was cooperative with 
3 your investigation?

5 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
I meant to ask you going back and going to 
6 come right back to the hospital, when you first 
7 encountered him, what was his demeanor? 
8 A He was calm, collected. I didn't see that 
9 there was any type of debilitating injury to where 
10 it would prevent any type of interview, like a head 
11 injury or something like that. He seemed to be 
12 talking, making logical sense and talking like that. 
13 So there was no concern that he had 
14 some major head injury, I guess, from my own opinion 
15 or appearance. 
16 Q He never complained about his head being 
17 injured? 
18 A Not to the point where he would have not 
19 been able to be interviewed.

Did he tell you he had a head injury?

1 almost standard questions that begin my interview. 
2 Those questions are, were you on duty today? 
3 He indicated he was. 
4 What was your call sign if you were 
5 to call out on the radio? His call sign was Frank

7 What sector he was assigned to. 
8 Sector 1. 
9 What is the beginning and end times 
10 for his scheduled shift. He indicated he began a 
11 shift at 6:30 in the morning and was scheduled to 
12 end his shift at 6:30 at night. 
13 What he was wearing. He indicated he 
14 was wearing the uniform he currently had on and the 
15 rest of it what he left at the station. And what 
16 vehicle he was assigned that day. He said he was 
17 assigned vehicle 108, which he describes as a fully 
18 marked Ferguson patrol vehicle. 
19 Q And is it your understanding that that 
20 vehicle is actually a truck? 
21

Yes, it was a Chevy Tahoe.

1 A Basically during the cursory interview, I 
2 asked a very open ended question and allow that 
3 person to just talk. Tell me, from basically start 
4 to finish, what happened. And the only time I will 
5 really interrupt if I need a clarifying question or 
6 something I didn't understand it, I need time 
7 catching up writing down what he's saying. 
8 I just essentially asked Officer 
9 Darren Wilson to describe what happened and where he 
10 was at prior to the incident up through the 
11 incident. 
12 He tells me that he was leaving an 
13 unrelated sick case call and was driving, it would 
14 be west on Canfield Road. As he's driving he hears 
15 a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing 
16 in progress at 9101 West Florissant Avenue, and he 
17 provides us with that address and the nature of the 
18 call was a stealing. 
19 He said that the call comments 
20 indicated the suspect description was a black male 
21 wearing a black shirt and brown shorts, and that an 
22 additional call comment indicated that taken during 
23 the stealing were Cigarillos.

1 driving west down, continues west down Canfield Road 
2 and he sees two subjects approaching from the area 
3 of West Florissant and Canfield walking in the 
4 center of the street. 
5 I then ask Officer Darren Wilson to 
6 describe the two subjects. 
7 He describes one subject as a black 
8 male, dark complexion, approximately 5 foot 5, with 
9 short dreadlock style hair wearing a black T-shirt. 
10 He describes the second male as a black male, medium 
11 complexion, approximately 6 foot 3, approximately 
12 270 pounds, clean shaven, wearing a red baseball 
13 style cap, a gray shirt, khaki shorts and yellow 
14 socks. 
15 Officer Wilson then tells me that as 
16 he's traveling west down Canfield Road, he stops his 
17 patrol vehicle and allows the two subjects to 
18 approach. So basically they're walking towards the 
19 front of his patrol vehicle. 
20 Q Did he indicate whether they were walking 
21 single file or side by side or anything? 
22 A He never did and I didn't ask. He just 
23 says they were walking down the center of the 
24 street.

1 A He says at this time his driver's window 
2 is down, fully down. The, he allows the subjects to 
3 approach and then says to the two subjects. "Hey, 
4 why don't you guys walk on the sidewalk." And 
5 that's what he quoted, that's the quote that he 
6 said. 
7 Q Did he say anything about whether he 
8 thought this was a confrontation or it was an angry 
9 exchange or did he not refer at all? 
10 A 
11 stated. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
He didn't elaborate, he just said that I 
Okay, go ahead. 
He says right after he makes that 
14 statement, the shorter male says, "we're almost to 
15 our destination." And then it's quickly followed by 
16 the larger male stating, "the fuck with what you 
17 have to say", and he quotes that. And then they 
18 continue to walk past his vehicle, which would be 
19 east on Canfield. 
20 Q At that point does he say that he 
21 investigates these two for stealing Cigarillos, does 
22 he mention anything to them about the theft?

1 tells me that he got on his radio and says that he's 
2 going to be conducting, notifies his dispatcher he 
3 is conducting a pedestrian check and he requests an 
4 assist car. 
5 He then places his vehicle in reverse 
6 and backs up towards the subjects. He places his 
7 car in park, I'm sorry. As he attempts to exit his 
8 vehicle he says, "hey, come here." That's a quote 
9 that he used, "hey, come here." 
10 As he's opening his door he feels the 
11 door get slammed shut and then realizes the larger 
12 of the two subjects pushed his driver's door closed. 
13 He then tells the large subject to 
14 get back and to move, and attempts to open the door 
15 a second time. The door is then forced shut again, 
16 and he describes that the larger subject is standing 
17 at his driver's door with both hands on the door 
18 frame of the vehicle like where the window would 
19 come up is how he describes it. 
20 And then Officer Wilson orders the 
21 subject, or the subject to get back again. And 
22 those are his words, get back and move is what the 
23 two words that he's using. 
24 Officer Wilson then tells me that the

1 window with his upper body. And he details it is 
2 his upper body and both of his arms. 
3 The subject, according to Officer 
4 Darren Wilson, begins striking him in the chin, 
5 face, shoulders and chest. As he described it is 
6 the subject was swinging wildly. 
7 During this time Officer Wilson's 
8 trying to deflect the punches with his left hand 
9 while giving the subject commands to get back and 
10 move and stop. 
11 After that, Officer Wilson, he 
12 continues and states that subject then reaches 
13 backwards with his left hand, and basically removes 
14 his left hand and arm from the vehicle and hands 
15 something to the other subject and says, "here, take 
16 this," is what Officer Wilson says that he hears the 
17 larger subject say. 
18 He did not, nor did I ask, describe 
19 what he thought was handed off, but he said that he 
20 handed something. 
21 He continues that immediately after 
22 the subject says, "here, take this." He then 
23 quickly moves his left arm and hand back into the 
24 vehicle and then punches Officer Darren Wilson in 
25 the right side of the face.

1 Officer Wilson then tells me that 
2 this instantly stunned him and he starts basically 
3 backing away and leaning back. Officer Wilson tells 
4 me he continues with his left hand and forearm to 
5 try to deflect the punches that he's being hit with 
6 and then he starts going, as he puts it, through the 
7 progression on his belt. 
8 He thinks about grabbing his mace, 
9 which is situated on his duty belt, however, he is 
10 in a seated position and he can't retrieve it and it 
11 is on the right side of his belt. 
12 He then considers using an asp baton. 
13 What an asp baton is, is a retractable baton that's 
14 standard issue for law enforcement. He says that he 
15 believed that due to the confined space from within 
16 the patrol vehicle, that it would be an ineffective 
17 tool. 
18 And at this point I believe I asked 
19 Officer Darren Wilson if he thought he could escape 
20 any other way? And he says no. 
21 He describes the interior of the 
22 patrol vehicle or the Tahoe as having a computer and 
23 a radio and a shotgun in the center console, which 
24 prevented him from being able to climb over or get 
25 out of the passenger side of the vehicle.

1 I asked Officer Darren Wilson to 
2 continue. He stated that he then used his left 
3 forearm, again, to try to create space between 
4 himself and the subject, and then he retrieves his 
5 department issued firearm from his holster, which is 
6 situated on the right side of his belt.

He then removes his department issued 
17 firearm from his holster and begins to raise it and 
18 as he's raising it he yells, he said he yelled, stop 
19 or I'll shoot. 
20 Officer Wilson then tells me the 
21 subject then grabs with his hand the top of the 
22 slide of the firearm. And he says that his hand is 
23 large enough to encompass the top of the slide. The 
24 majority of the hand grips and the trigger guard,

3 "you're too much of a pussy to shoot me." And that 
4 was a quote from Darren Wilson. 
5 Q Did he give you any of his opinions or

14 and Officer Darren Wilson tells me he can feel the 
15 barrel of his own firearm pressed against his left 
16 hip as he is in the seated position. 
17 Officer Wilson then continued stating 
18 that once he felt the barrel of the weapon pushed 
19 into his hip, he was able to shift his lower half to 
20 the right and basically get the barrel of the 
21 firearm to now be pointed at the seat and off of his 
22 hip.

1 of the frame of the weapon. And then is able to 
2 push it away from him to where the weapon is now 
3 pointed at the driver's door. 
4 He says that he then pulls the 
5 trigger and nothing happens, the gun misfires. 
6 He continues by stating that he 
7 believed that due to the subjects hands being on the 
8 top of the slide and on the trigger, I'm sorry, on 
9 the hammer, that's what caused the gun to misfire. 
10 Officer Wilson continues and states 
11 that he then pulled the trigger again, at which time 
12 one round of ammunition was fired. 
13 Immediately following that, he sees a 
14 large explosion of glass and then looks down and 
15 sees what he believed was blood on his hands. He 
16 said at that point he didn't know if he was injured 
17 or the subject was injured, just knew that he saw 
18 blood.

20 subject hands were still on the gun and he pulled 
21 the trigger two more times and it misfired both 
22 times.

3 Q So one shot you said was fired inside, 
4 while he was sitting inside the vehicle? 
A Yes. 5 
6 Q Okay. And he considered, he realized he 
7 could not escape, I'm not saying he should escape, 
8 he considered that he could go to the left side or 
9 passenger side, he was blocked by the shotgun or? 
10 A Yes, he describes that there's a computer,

12 controls to the light bar and siren, and then a 
13 shotgun. And there's just no means of escape 
14 through the passenger side of the car.

1 A Yes. He says that the subject is then 
2 running east on Canfield, and Officer Darren Wilson 
3 then exits his vehicle and upon doing so, he says he 
4 radioed to his dispatcher that shots were fired, and 
5 he continued to exit the vehicle. 
6 He says he observed the subject 
7 running east on Canfield at which time he pursued on 
8 foot. 
9 He says after, or during this chase, 
10 he's giving the subject loud, verbal commands as he 
11 puts it, to stop and to get on the ground. 
12 Officer Wilson then tells me that the 
13 subject then stops and turns around. He estimated 
14 the distance was approximately 30 feet from him. 
15 So at that time Officer Wilson 
16 stopped in the street and then began to order the 
17 subject to stop and get on the ground. 
18 He continues and tells me that as he 
19 turns around, the subject has, as he quotes it, "an 
20 intense and psychotic look on his face." The 
21 subject then takes his right hand and moves it 
22 towards his waistband on the right side. 
23 Officer Wilson then says the subject 
24 screams something inaudible, doesn't know what he 
25 said, but just screams something and begins to

1 charge him. And that's Officer Wilson's word was 
2 charge. 
3 As the subject is moving towards him, 
4 he is giving him, continually giving him commands to 
5 stop. As he is backpedaling to try to, as he says, 
6 try to maintain the distance between the two. 
7 He then continues and states that he 
8 knew if the subject were to reach him, that he 
9 would, and he quotes, "he would be done." Meaning 
10 that Officer Wilson would be done. He knew, he 
11 immediately stated he knew he was overpowered and 
12 assaulted already one time in the vehicle. 
13 Officer Wilson continued and stated 
14 as the subject got within 15 feet of him, he 
15 discharged five rounds of ammunition. He said that 
16 this had no effect and the subject continued towards 
17 him. 
18 Q Did he indicate whether, did he, he may 
19 not have, indicate whether or not any of the five 
20 rounds entered the body of Michael Brown? 
21 A He did not know, nor did I ask. He just 
22 said that the subject continued to come towards him. 
23 Q Did he indicate to you how, when the 
24 subject turned around, I think you said that he put 
25 his arms some kind of way and charged him?

He says that --
Can you demonstrate that for us? 
I'm sorry? 
Did he show you how? 
Officer Wilson kind of spoke with his 
6 hands and he does demonstrate that the subject --
7 Q Can you stand up and show us, please? 
8 A Yes. When the subject turns around, his 
9 right and goes to his waistband. Now, he did not 
10 say in his waistband or he just says to his 
11 waistband. 
12 And like we kind of covered earlier, 
13 the cursory interview is not to get, it is more so 
14 for the physical evidence to assist the 
15 investigators on the scene. 
16 So any clarifying questions would 
17 have been done during an audiotaped interviewed, 
18 which occurred later on.

1 A Yes, he says that the first shots were 
2 five, he believes it was approximately five rounds 
3 of ammunition and the subject continued towards him. 
4 He then discharged two additional, 
5 approximately two additional rounds of ammunition, 
6 and he said those had no effect and the subject 
7 continued towards him. 
8 He then states that the subject 
9 started to lean forward and to Officer Darren Wilson 
10 appeared that the subject was attempting to tackle 
11 him, and that's his word was tackle. At which time 
12 he discharged one additional round of ammunition. 
13 Officer Wilson stated he then used 
14 his radio and notified his dispatcher, and I believe 
15 his quote was, "send me every car you've got and the 
16 supervisor." 
17 Q Did he indicate that he knew where that 
18 last round landed? 
19 A He said he believed it hit him in his 
20 head. 
21 Q Have you ever heard any of the radio 
22 transmissions?

24 
A

Afterwards, yes, I have.

1 A I listened to bits and pieces, but as far 
2 as a continual listening to every piece of radio 
3 traffic, no, that was not my responsibility. 
4 Q What part of the radio traffic were you 
5 interested in listening to? 
6 A I believe it was just random bits to see 
7 what all that we had. So from at the very beginning 
8 would be him being dispatched to the sick case 
9 through the end of when St. Louis County basically 
10 departed the scene. 
11 There was no specific pieces of radio 
12 traffic that I was either interested in or 
13 documented.

21 at 9101 West Florissant. It was never addressed 
22 after that or brought up.

1 officer and Michael Brown, did Michael Brown have 
2 anything in his hands, did he mention he had 
3 anything in his hands at the time? 
4 A He says when, the way he describes it is 
5 when he reaches back and says, "here, take this." 
6 That he hands something off to the other individual, 
7 but he doesn't know what it was. So he just says, 
8 he left it at something. 
9 Did you 
10 state that after the first shot went off in the car 
11 when he was trying to gain control of his weapon, 
12 that it misfired two more times? 
13 A The total number that he can approximate 
14 is three. The first time he pulled the trigger he 
15 said that it misfired. The second time he pulled 
16 the trigger it fired and then he said he tried two 
17 additional times and they misfired. 
18 Okay, thank you. 
19 The first 
20 misfire he said was because Michael's hand was on 
21 the gun, what about the second and third one, was 
22 there still that contact going on? 
23 A He says that that's what he believed. 
24 Now, I'm not a firearms expert nor was I there, but 
25 he says that he believes that that's what caused the

1 misfire. 
2 Throughout this he never says that 
3 Michael, the subject, takes his hand off the weapon 
4 until he continues the assault, the second assault 
5 in the vehicle. 
6 Just to follow-up, did you 
7 have a sense for how long that altercation lasted? 
8 A He approximated a minute from start to 
9 finish. 
10 When we 
11 talk about misfire, can you kind of walk us through 
12 that process what it looks like? 
13 A Sure. So there's many reasons. And like 
14 I said, I'm not a firearms expert, however, in my 
15 job I do carry a firearm and know some things about 
16 it is that a weapon can misfire for many different 
17 reasons. 
18 One of them being if there's anything 
19 that is impeding the hammer of the firearm from 
20 coming forward and striking the firing pin, that 
21 will cause the weapon to misfire. So if you put 
22 anything in there, a piece of rope, or as the case 
23 may be, if a hand is pushed down on that hammer, it 
24 won't let that hammer cycle and won't allow the 
25 weapon to fire. Does that clarify it?

2 So the bullet would remain in the gun, it 
3 would not have impacted, it potentially would be 
4 able to be shot again, there would no casing 
5 discharged? 
6 A Correct. So if the weapon misfires in 
7 that form, the casing will not be discharged, the 
8 round that is currently in the chamber will still be 
9 a live round, it will still fire if the gun cycles 
10 properly the next time. 
11 Okay, thank you. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a follow-up question 
13 about that. And you're familiar with the Sig Sauer 
14 weapon that this officer was carrying? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I am. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And this is a weapon 
17 that when it fires properly, the empty cartridge is 
18 ejected from the gun ejection port, right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that's on top of the weapon, at least 
21 in the area where Officer Wilson said Michael Brown 
22 had his hands, correct? 
A That is correct. 23 
24 Q Can you explain to the jurors what 
25 stovepiping means?

1 A Stovepiping is a term used in firearms 
2 where the round, a live round will be, it could be a 
3 spent round also, casing is basically partially 
4 ejected and is situated in a manner that looks like 
5 the round is sitting vertical on the gun. If I'm

7 stovepipe coming out of an oven. And that basically
