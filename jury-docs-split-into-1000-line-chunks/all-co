Correct. 
Not spent round, a live round? 
Live round. 
Okay. Did you do any testing to determine 
20 if there was any substance on that spent projectile? 
21 A No, I wouldn't do that. Our firearms 
22 examiner would do that. 
23 Q So if there is blood or anything on there 
24 that's not something that you would have looked at 
25 or tested for?

9 concerns? And I hear, I'm going to meet with Bob 
10 McCulloch about maybe communicating with people out 
11 there about the process of the grand jury and why it 
12 is not going to be done this Friday and so forth. 
13 I think 
14 he has done pretty much getting it out there. I 
15 think the community leaders need to back him up and 
16 confirm what he's saying, I mean. I'm quite sure 
17 the process is written somewhere in the book or law 
18 books or whatever and it is pretty out there what 
19 the process is, they just need to tell, I think, the 
20 community to try and get some stability back into 
21 the community. 
22 This is what, this is what they're doing, 
23 this is what they need to do. I mean, if I were in 
24 Michael Brown's or Darren Wilson's shoes, I would 
25 want somebody to know everything before you make a

1 decision what happens to me or my life or what I did 
2 or what I didn't do. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: And that was, you know, 
4 Mr. McCulloch's, pledge at the very beginning that 
5 you all would hear everything. I know it is very 
6 tedious at times, but as you are beginning to see, 
7 there is a lot of people that see different bits and 
8 pieces, a lot of different viewpoints, a lot of 
9 different statements and so, you know, it is going 
10 to be up to you guys to sift through that. We don't 
11 want to leave anything out. Down the road after 
12 this decision is made, I don't want somebody saying, 
13 well, you didn't call this person. 
14 But as far as the community leaders, you 
15 know, that's going to be something that is up to 
16 Mr. McCulloch. And as you know, there have been a 
17 lot of those same people have called for him to 
18 recuse himself and not be the prosecutor on this 
19 case. I don't know what kind of communication would 
20 happen between them if there would be, but I hear 
21 you and I know what you're saying. But ultimately, 
22 Sheila and I are we're just doing this part of it, 
23 it will be up to Mr. McCulloch to decide how to 
24 handles that kind of public relations issue.

1 though. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
3 Could you maybe 
4 just do a little research too to see if there has 
5 and how common it is that a grand jury would release 
6 a statement with their ultimate decision at the end? 
7 I don't know that we would ever want to, but it 
8 might be an option to help calm things or a thought. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: It is funny that you say 
10 that and I think, I don't know if you guys have 
11 asked that before. I mean, I have been here 26 
12 years and, urn, actually even before Bob McCulloch 
13 was the elected prosecutor. And never in my 
14 experience, now I know that we have had several 
15 grand juries conduct investigations into excessive 
16 force involving police officers, whether it be 
17 shootings, whether it be homicide or an assault 
18 where a person wasn't killed, I'm not aware of ever 
19 being a statement released after the grand jury has 
20 made its determination. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: I'm sorry, Kathi, let me 
22 make sure I understand. Were you suggesting that a 
23 grand juror would make a statement? 
24 I'm not actually 
25 suggesting that we want to, just was wondering if it

1 ever happened or was that in the history of that or 
2 kind of like you were going through what the debate 
3 time we would also continue if we didn't have a 
4 certain number going to look into that. I'm curious 
5 as well if there had been any historical point of 
6 grand juries doing that. I don't even know if we 
7 would even want to. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm not aware of anything 
9 like that ever happening. 
10 I don't think, one thing, 
11 I don't want them to know me or know anything. I 
12 don't want anything out there. 
13 Yeah, we would never make 
14 a statement with names. 
15 But for me, I don't want 
16 nothing to do with any release, the press, the news. 
17 Just to be clear, it 
18 wouldn't be an individual statement.

MS. ALIZADEH: I'm not sure what your 
21 charge is. I know that the judge read the charge to 
22 you as to what your duties and obligations are. I 
23 don't know how that extends beyond your term. Like, 
24 you know, I know when we have a trial, the jury is 
25 told they can't discuss this with anyone, but at the

1 conclusion of the trial that admonition is lifted 
2 and they're told you can discuss this with whomever 
3 you wish or not at all, it is up to you. 
4 I haven't seen what the charge is that the 
5 grand jury gets. I don't know that if the grand 
6 jury is allowed to talk about this after the fact. 
7 I'm not sure about that and we can look into that, 
8 but what I'm guessing or I'm thinking, and you all, 
9 you know, again, there's nothing written in stone 
10 right now, but you are talking about the possibility 
11 as the grand jury as a group preparing some kind of 
12 formal statement that would accompany your decision. 
13 And it wouldn't be like your names would be attached 
14 to it, you would agree on some kind of statement 
15 that you would want to make about whatever you would 
16 want the public to know about that. 
17 I'm not aware of that ever happening and 
18 so I'll look into that to see if that's even 
19 possible. Obviously, if they say no because your 
20 admonition is not lifted after, then you can't talk 
21 about your, the process and your deliberations and 
22 the evidence that you heard. 
23 So I will look into that.

5 saying this morning. We are going to start out with 
6 the witness that we talked about last time we were 
7 together that's 
8 Before she comes in, however, she is here 
9 waiting to give testimony. Before she comes in 
10 we're going to listen to a statement that she gave 
11 to the federal, during the federal investigation, 
12 FBI and U.S. attorney and well a couple of attorneys 
13 from the Department of Justice. So we will hear 
14 that interview. It is probably in totality an hour 
15 and 13, 14 minutes, something like that. 
16 We have the transcript that Kathi will 
17 pass out in a moment and she wanted to let everybody 
18 know that we just got the transcript, I believe, 
19 last night.

22 had a chance to proof it. So as you are listening
