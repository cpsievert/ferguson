And he didn't describe shooting his gun

11 turned around, a series of shots that he fired at 
12 Mr. Brown?

Correct. 
And you said he said maybe I can't

18 Q Okay. Now, when you had a subsequent 
19 conversation with him, did any part of that change, 
20 did he tell you any more details about the number of 
21 shots? 
22 A No, he said he had learned that he had 
23 fired more than four shots. I didn't specifically 
24 ask him a number, but he said he was told that he 
25 fired more than he thought.

Is there anything, so you had an

14 between the community and the police?

16 concerned, every time we responded over there, we

And in more detail recently, your last

Okay. 
That's when he was more, a little bit more 
More detailed. Did he talk about anything 
15 about the stealing that occurred at Ferguson Market 
16 that he was stopping these two to investigate that? 
17 A He said he did not have that call, that 
18 call I later found out was given to Officer

20 Q Did he know about it, did he talk about 
21 knowing about the stealing?

1 A He did not know anything. He was out on 
2 another call in the apartment complex adjacent to 
3 Canfield Green. 
4 Q Okay. And so when he's stopping these two 
5 it is strictly about the sidewalk, it has nothing to 
6 do with him investigating the stealing of 
7 Cigarillos; is that correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Did he indicate that he was angered at all 
10 when he was told to fuck off? 
11 A Well, no police officer likes being told 
12 that. I don't think he was angered as much as he 
13 was just taken aback by it for no reason whatsoever. 
14 Q Is that like a sign of disrespect, I would 
15 feel disrespected if somebody told me to fuck off? 
16 A You know, respect toward the police 
17 nowadays is not like it used to be. Most of the 
18 time it is under their breath or just barely within 
19 earshot, but evidently at this point in time it was 
20 told quite directly at him.

22 indicate that when he chased Michael Brown, that 
23 assistance had been called for at that point?

9 department, that's the only time I know he's ever 
10 discharged a weapon. 
11 Q Have you ever known him to get into a

14 A He yelled at him to stop or halt, but 
15 nothing more than that. 
16 Are those the words he 
17 used stop, halt? 
18 A I don't know, I believe he just told him 
19 to stop. 
20 Okay. Did he indicate at 
21 any point when he, right after he had first contact 
22 with him and told him, asked him to get out of the 
23 street, that at any point he had to reverse his car 
24 back towards them?

4 MS. ALIZADEH: Sergeant I just want 
5 to clarify. I know you know things about what

7 this. Are you saying that you know that that 
8 happened because you've since learned that, or are 
9 you saying that Officer Wilson that day told you 
10 that he reversed his vehicle? 
11 A Officer Wilson did not tell me that day 
12 that he had to do that.

14 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay.

19 or not it is something that he knows happened 
20 because of subsequent investigation or if it is 
21 something that Officer Wilson said to you.

1 did not know about the stealing that was going on or 
2 had just occurred at the Ferguson Market. 
3 Now, my question to you is this, are 
4 you saying that because he told you he didn't know 
5 about it or you saying that because he didn't 
6 mention it to you when you were talking to him? 
7 A He did not mention it to me again. I 
8 learned about it at a later time. 
9 Q Has he ever told you, yeah, I didn't know 
10 anything about what happened up at the Ferguson 
11 Market?

1 call to dispatch, which initiated a call to you. 
2 You know, I understand from watching the news when 
3 someone calls 911, the recording is timestamped and 
4 there is an audio recording. In this instance or in 
5 a regular instance, when an officer calls dispatch, 
6 is there any sort of timestamp or recording, or 
7 secondary recording so we would know exactly what 
8 that call would be or when that call took place? 
9 A Yes, all of our incoming calls, including 
10 radio traffic, is recorded digitally. That would be 
11 available to the investigators through our 
12 communications supervisor. 
13 Are you aware of what that 
14 original call would have been when he called?

After the shooting of Michael Brown, was 
call when he dispatched that first call, was

(By Ms. Alizadeh) So it is important that 
11 you testify about your own personal knowledge and 
12 not what maybe somebody has told you that you 
13 believe. Would it be fair to say that you don't 
14 know what those calls consisted of because you have 
15 never heard them, right? 
16 A I don't know what the calls consist of,

19 a call, but you have never heard that yourself? 
20

No, ma'am.

7 A I was working 12 plus hours a day. 
8 I understand. Is it 
9 still, you still stay with the fact that Michael 
10 Brown had his hands up and was charging? 
11 A That's what Darren told me he was charging 
12 at me. 
13 This question is not 
14 meant as any disrespect, but your recorded statement 
15 you said that, urn, you have to ask stupid questions 
16 like how this could be prevented? 
17 A I'm sorry? 
18 In your recorded 
19 statement you said that you are required to ask 
20 officers stupid questions like how could this 
21 incident be prevented? 
22 A That's on the injury report. 
23 You feel that's a stupid 
24 question because you feel your officers don't have 
25 any other choice?

1 A Correct.

4 A When you are physically attacked 
5 unprovoked, I believe how could he prevent this is a 
6 stupid question. 
7 Okay, I'm done. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: 
9 Several 
10 questions. 
11 
12 
A Yes, ma'am. 
My first question is, when 
13 he was alone, when he left the scene of the crime, 
14 Officer Wilson, why was he left alone, why didn't 
15 another officer escort him back to the police 
16 department? 
17 A There was another police officer on light 
18 duty at the police department who could sit with 
19 him. 
20 Say that again? 
21 
22 
A There was another officer who, 
station 
23 bound. So there was an officer there who could sit 
24 with him until a supervisor got there. 
25 My question is, why wasn't

1 he escorted by another PO considering that even 
2 though he left the scene of the crime, that someone 
3 could have noticed him and followed him, but yet he 
4 wouldn't of had any backup or protection, he still 
5 would have been left alone? 
6 A I had, let's see, Darren made, Darren made 
7 my sixth officer for the day and that includes 
8 myself. 
9 I already had three other officers 
10 and myself at the scene, I had another officer still 
11 out on a call. So I only had one officer that was 
12 left on the street. I honestly, truthfully, I 
13 didn't have the manpower to send somebody with him. 
14 Okay. 
15 A But yes, you are correct, somebody could 
16 have followed him. But also on our radio we have 
17 Country Club Hills and Calverton Park. If there 
18 would have been a problem, there would have been 
19 other officers in the area from those two agencies 
20 that could have responded. 
21 Okay. My next question 
22 was or is, I seen pictures of the car, Officer 
23 Wilson's car. I only seen a little shattered glass 
24 that was on his driver's side seat? 
25 A Uh-huh.

1 Did he ever mention that 
2 the glass was half cracked, half down, or all the 
3 way down? 
4 A He never told me what the window position 
5 was, ma'am. 
6 Okay. My last question 
7 is, after the incident, the crime was over and you 
8 had time to go back to your office, did you ever 
9 think to read Officer Wilson's history prior to 
10 coming to your department or when he came up under 
11 your leadership to understand his previous history? 
12 A Anything that happened prior to his 
13 employment should have been covered by the officer 
14 who did his background investigation. 
15 Now, I don't know who did his 
16 background investigation preemployment. I did speak 
17 with his supervisor prior to him coming to my squad 
18 and ask what kind of officer he was. And I believe 
19 I was presented with a few training certificates 
20 that he had obtained while he was on the other 
21 squad, but there were no corrective measures or any 
22 disciplinary notes or anything such as that in what 
23 I was given.

2 in the last ten years? 
3 
4

A 
A 
Last ten years? 
Yeah? 
I believe one, maybe two. 
6 So they're a rare 
7 occurrence and not an every day --
8 
9 
A They are very rare occurrence, sir. 
Okay. Thank you. 
10 Is it 
11 standard procedure basically for only one officer to 
12 be on patrol at any given time by themself or do you 
13 do double duty where there is two officers so you 
14 have a ready backup in case of a situation that 
15 inflames? 
16 A On a perfect day I would have seven 
17 officers out there. 
18 Uh-huh. 
19 A I have four assigned sectors, which would 
20 be three cover cars to assist plus myself. 
21 Uh-huh. 
22 A So basically we would have two officers 
23 respond to most every call depending on what the 
24 call is naturally. 
25 Yes, ma'am.

I just need 
2 clarification. Did Officer Wilson have blood on his 
3 hands? 
4 
5 
A I did not see any blood. 
Okay. In the written, in 
6 the recorded statement we learned that he washed his 
7 hands because there was blood on them and he was 
8 checking for injury or the spread of infection?

A 
12 that day. 
Whose recorded statement? 
Your recorded statement. 
It had to be something I learned after 
13 All right, thank you. 
14 Also to 
15 clarify. I want to make sure when you told Officer 
16 Darren Wilson to get in your vehicle and go back to 
17 the Ferguson Police Department, at that time he was 
18 still currently wearing his uniform he had on at the 
19 time of the incident and his gun was with him when 
20 he went back to Ferguson? 
21 A His sidearm, yes, he carried his side arm 
22 back to Ferguson holstered. 
23 And at that point, I 
24 guess, you were at the scene, you wouldn't have 
25 known what happened to that gun or who would have

1 processed it or his clothes or anything because you 
2 were at the scene?

MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
MS. WHIRLEY: I just have one. Whose 
8 decision was it to call county in to investigate? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
It was the chief of police's decision. 
(By Ms. Whirley) This is pretty standard 
11 when there is a shooting, you say you have been 
12 involved in a few shootings, do you generally have 
13 another department investigate it or do you 
14 investigate it yourselves? 
15 A One of the previous, or the one, I should 
16 say the two that I investigated, we investigated 
17 them. This one, well, the first two were only, they 
18 were not mortal wounds, they weren't fatalities. 
19 I believe the chief made that 
20 decision because of, it would be better to have an 
21 outside agency such as county or state police to do 
22 the investigation to show that we were not trying to 
23 hide or cover up anything. 
24 
25 Q 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.

1 you've said to me at least before, I can't remember 
2 if you testified today that you don't recall what 
3 time you got up to the scene, the time it was? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But assuming that we know that the 
6 shooting occurred somewhere like a quarter after 
7 noon, give or take a few minutes, but I'm just 
8 trying to use that as a reference, how long was it 
9 before you saw county officers responding up at the 
10 scene? 
11 A Uh, I believe the first one arrived on the 
12 scene anywhere from an hour to an hour 15. 
13 Q So were you privy to the decision to call 
14 county into the investigation, were you talking with 
15 the superiors when that decision was made? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
So whoever made that decision, you don't 
18 know when that decision was made? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
But you were at the scene for about an 
21 hour to an hour and a half you said? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
Hour 15, yeah. 
Before you saw county arrive? 
Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I have one last question.
