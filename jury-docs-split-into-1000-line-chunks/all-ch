4 You say, yeah, close to his shoulder, 
5 right? 
6 Uh-huh. 
7 And he asked you at somewhat 
8 of angle? You say at 35 to 45 degree angle from the 
9 body. About like this, and you have the palms up, 
10 right? 
11 Oh, yeah. 
12 And you say he is standing 
13 there, he looks, he looks down looking at his body. 
14 That's where you're saying you thought he was 
15 looking to see if he was shot? 
16 Right. 
17 Okay. And then after that, 
18 you go on to say that Detective asked you, 
19 Michael Brown is standing facing the officer at this 
20 point with his hands at his rib cage. And you say, 
21 yeah. 
22 And Detective says hands, palms up, 
23 like at his rib cage. 
24 And you say, uh-huh. Does that sound 
25 right?

4 standing facing the officer at this point with his 
5 hands at his rib cage, and you say, yeah. 
6 Detective says hands, palms up, and 
7 you say uh-huh. Is that the way you recall it 
8 today? 
9 Yeah. 
10 And you go on to say, or 
11 Detective asked you, and he was looking down 
12 at his body at some point. You already told him he 
13 was looking down at his body. Detective 
14 says, he was looking down at his body at some point, 
15 and you say right, right, uh-huh. Okay. All right. 
16 
17 
18 
Is that the way recall it? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Just to be clear too, 
19 we talked about when you thought that the officer 
20 must have said something to Michael Brown because 
21 Michael Brown then approached the vehicle, that's 
22 when you saw the tussle. 
23 So you actually saw Michael Brown come to 
24 the side of the vehicle, he approached the side of 
25 the vehicle?

1 Right, he wasn't that far

3 Okay. 
4 His friend was still, when he 
5 looped around, Mike was still in the street, his 
6 friend had backed up. His friend had actually 
7 That's when he goes to the 
8 sidewalk? 
9 Yeah, he steps back, you 
10 know. 
11 Let me ask you this. 
12 had asked you this a little while ago about, and you 
13 sort of were very clear about where everyone was. 
14 But she had asked you about when the officer went 
15 after Michael, where was his gun at that time, or 
16 could you see it. And you corrected her and said, 
17 well, he just went to the back of the vehicle and 
18 assumed his stance. 
19 When he came out from around, 
20 he must of already pulled it out of his holster as 
21 he was coming around. 
22 And that's what I'm 
23 wondering. Could you see that, could you see where 
24 the gun was before he assumed his stance? 
25 It was in his hand and he

Okay. Before he brought it 
3 up in a stance, it was in his hand. 
4 It was in his hand. 
5 You are directing like out 
6 by itself? 
7 Right. He's pulling it out 
8 and as he came around so he could get a line sight 
9 on Michael, he whipped his hand up, gun is already 
10 in his hand, put it in his palm and aimed. 
11 Shortly after that he said 
12 stop? 
13 He said stop. When he said 
14 stop, Michael had already stopped. 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 When he turned around, he 
17 said stop again. When Michael took another step, he 
18 said stop. As he hit the street, after he said 
19 stop, he fired. That's when he started staggering 
20 around. You could tell he got hit the way his body 
21 jerked, okay. And as he was coming forward, trying 
22 to keep his balance, I guess keep from falling, he 
23 couldn't stand. He was trying to get hisself in a 
24 position, I believe, so that he could stand up. 
25 As he took those steps, the officer took

1 about two, three steps back. As he did that at the 
2 same time, he yelled stop again. Michael was then, 
3 you could tell he was about ready to fall. At the 
4 angle of his body, torso practically straight, knees 
5 wobbly, but the torso was almost at a 45 degree 
6 angle, his hands are slowly coming down. 
7 His hands were coming down? 
8 Right, coming down. 
9 And he was bent toward the 
10 officer? 
11 He was bent toward the 
12 officer. 
13 Let me stop you there real 
14 quick. On August 12th, again, I want to take you 
15 back to what you said. Detective asked you 
16 where you describe exactly this point, Detective 
17 asked you, and where are his hands at this 
18 point. 
19 And you say, after he hit him with the 
20 three shots, they were down. 
21 Right. 
22 Detective says, okay, 
23 where at? 
24 You say, down beside his body like this.

2 And you said, yeah, they, like they were 
3 down. 
4 Right. 
5 Is that the way you recall 
6 it today? 
7 Right. 
8 That was after three shots? 
9 After the three shots. 
10 Because he was going down? 
11 Yeah, he was hit. As he was 
12 coming forward, he was trying to maintain his 
13 balance. 
14 And I know this, I've been shot, all 
15 right. I've been shot in the leg, so I know how it 
16 is to try to get your balance. 
17 And as I try to make this perfectly clear, 
18 his torso was straight, knees wobbly, but his upper 
19 torso was bent and he was still, kept his focus on 
20 the officer. 
21 So to be clear, from your 
22 vantage point, and I don't want you, I know you were 
23 shot so you know how it feels to be wobbly. From 
24 what you could actually see, Michael Brown was 
25 focused on the officer, correct?

19 up. Okay. 
20 He was shot, he was hurt. He was trying 
21 to keep up on his feet. He wasn't going toward the 
22 officer to try to get to him. He was trying to 
23 stand up. He was trying to maintain hisself, but

3 him. 
4 And no sooner than they said that he was 
5 going like this, his body was coming like this 
6 because he wasn't even looking and he fired. That's 
7 the only way he could have hit him in the head, the 
8 only way. He was already on his way down. The man 
9 was unarmed, you had already put three to four shots 
10 in his body.

4 Yeah, we were standing, no.

5 they are working on from my bedroom window. 
6 He was talking, as I said, he was talking 
7 to a detective because his car was parked up on the 
8 grass on my side of street. And another officer in 
9 uniform had on a blue shirt. I didn't see the 
10 insignias, but I'm just saying that because Ferguson 
11 wear that types of collar, that may be a Ferguson 
12 officer that I had not talked to that man at all 
13 that day. 
14 Okay. 
15 I did not speak to him. 
16 All right. Let's back up a 
17 little bit then. When you come down and there are 
18 people saying things that you didn't see, how 
19 quickly after those last shots were fired was that 
20 happening? I mean, where people were actual 
21 actually saying things like that? 
22 After he hit the ground, I 
23 would say it took at least about a minute. 
24 That's when the crowd starts 
25 to gather, it was like an instant?

1 In a minute, maybe 20, 30, 
2 two, three minutes, at least be about 70 or 80, it 
3 grew. 
4 Not just the crowd, but 
5 people talking about saying things that didn't 
6 happen? 
7 Right, right. They start 
8 embellishing it when the stepfather showed up. 
9 When, I'm sorry? 
10 The stepfather. 
11 The stepfather. 
12 He's the first one that I 
13 later found out, I didn't know it was the stepfather 
14 until a few minutes later when he approached. They 
15 had started the tape up and he was trying to get to 
16 him. Oh, you know, my God, yeah, he was screaming 
17 and hollering. And the officer is trying to calm 
18 him down. 
19 And then I saw his cousin, a little girl, 
20 she has blond hair, she ran up the street. They all 
21 came from Northwinds. That's where the majority of 
22 the crowd came from. 
23 When you say they started 
24 embellishing, what did you hear? 
25 Oh, the officer ran up behind

3 Not true. 
4 What else? 
5 He hads his hand straight up

7 who the heck it was, I had never seen him before, he 
8 came out of the blue. He was coming out saying that 
9 Mike had reached in and got the gun out of his hand, 
10 not true. 
11 You mention on August 12th 
12 that after that it was everyone started coming from 
13 the back saying, oh, my God, he had his hands up in 
14 the air telling him don't shoot, don't shoot, don't 
15 shoot. And you said he never uttered a word, right?

Right, right. Just what you

23 that's when everyone come back and all of them 
24 started saying things, oh, he was on his knees.

10 None of those things

15 Uh-huh. 
16 Can you describe your 
17 interaction of what you saw? 
18 Me and the lady was sitting 
19 outside, sitting on the step. She was sitting in 
20 her chair on the lower level and he come up, instead 
21 of going through the driveway, they cut across the 
22 grass right there. 
23 When you say that was he with 
24 his friend that he was there during the incident? 
25 No, he was with some girl. I

3 ma'am. I said, how you doing. I said, you all 
4 doing okay? Yeah. He said all right, looks like it 
5 is going to be a good day. All right. And he 
6 walked up. 
7 About what time was that. 
8 About, it was early. It was 
9 early. I don't know, probably around 8:00, 
10 somewhere after 8:00. 
11 Did you see him at all that 
12 morning. 
13 Next time I saw Michael he 
14 was laying on the ground, or the street. 
15 Have you seen that girl he was 
16 walking with, have you seen her since. 
17 I think I have. I can't say 
18 100 percent sure. I wasn't paying too much 
19 attention to her. He was talking to me. You 
20 talking to me, I'm looking at your face. 
21 Do you know her name?

Let's talk about that. You 
2 talk about the things, the crowd grew and the young 
3 guys out there saying things that were not true. 
4 August 12th, you said something about this, I want 
5 to ask you about it. By living out there if you go 
6 against what they are saying, you think they might 
7 nut you up and go crazy. What do you mean by that? 
8 They had it in their mindset 
9 of what happened. They're set. They are looking 
10 for a reason to explode because they don't have 
11 anything to do. 
12 Why, why look for a reason to 
13 explode? 
14 They got nothing else to do. 
15 They are running all day, they are drinking and 
16 they're getting high all today. We see this all the 
17 time. 
18 We have been on Canfield Green apartment 
19 management to get all the drugs out of there. Okay. 
20 All the time. Northwinds got so bad they put gates 
21 up. When the gates up, the crime went up. You 
22 know, I don't trust anyone out there.

I had to run two of them off my porch who 
and came and sit on my porch while and 
4 grandkids are inside, I'd been to the doctor's 
5 office. (inaudible) They are sitting on my porch, 
6 on my chairs rolling up their blunts. That's how it 
7 is. 
8 And if they strong enough to do that and 
9 they feel you are going up against them, huh-uh,

11 What would happen to somebody 
12 like that? 
13 Oh, shoot, they'll jump you,

15 Do you think that's the general 
16 feeling there if someone say something to either us 
17 or the local police, goes against what they want, 
18 that they will go against them. 
19 I think now as it is getting 
20 longer in time, the majority of them in our 
21 neighborhood, my community, want the truth. It is 
22 that outside forces that are coming in. When they 
23 burnt that thing down yesterday, 80 percent of the 
24 people were from the city, not from there. Cars 
25 were coming in, the parking lots were full. That

Yes.

Oh, yes. 
What did you see? 
I was standing outside in the 
10 morning, I come out every morning, step out, try to 
11 smoke a cigarette outside. I stepped outside, there 
12 was a gray car and a red car, I mean, a white and 
13 black car, sorry, sitting there. A gray, dark gray, 
14 charcoal gray car pulled up there, now there's three 
15 of them. 
16 The first two, they were taking pictures. 
17 In fact, a girl was in the white car, she got out 
18 and stood on the driver's side, took a couple 
19 pictures, got in. And I saw those two drive off. 
20 The charcoal gray car pulled up beside it. 
21 I said, oh, I forgot my cigarette butt, I left it on 
22 the kitchen counter. So I walked in, I got it, I 
23 came back out, I left and I walked to the other side 
24 of the porch, just look around, I like to look 
25 around, see the cars and see who is out and

2 my front door, he gunned it or she gunned it or they 
3 gunned it and the car peeled off. 
4 Next thing I know, whoosh. 
5 It shot up? 
6 It just blew up and there 
7 wasn't no slow flame, it just whoosh. 
8 You talking about the memorial? 
9 Yes. 
10 Did you see anybody go other 
11 and do anything? 
12 I didn't see anybody. They 
13 could have done anything from the car window. They 
14 could have threw something out of the window. But 
15 that was definitely to me an accelerant because the 
16 way the fire went up, it just went whoosh. It 
17 wasn't a slow burn. I mean, they talking about a

2 MS. ALIZADEH: There is no conversation

7 a lot of more of your time. We just have a few more 
8 questions for you, okay. 
9 My understanding is before we took the 
10 break, you talk about one concern you had, 
11 obviously, after this shooting occurred, people 
12 coming out and saying things that were not true 
13 based on what you saw, correct? 
14 Yes. 
15 One of those things these 
16 young men coming out saying that Michael Brown had 
17 his hands all the way up in the air like 
18 surrendering at the time that the shooting was going 
19 on; is that correct? 
20 Right. 
21 You didn't see that? 
22 I did not see that. 
23 Okay. I just want to 
24 clarify that. If I could, I referred you to some of 
25 your statement on August 12th and I just want to

1 make sure that I understand your statement then and 
2 now, okay. And if you like, I have another copy 
3 here, you can refer to if you want to or I can read 
4 you these portions, is that fine? 
5 That's fine. 
6 Okay. At the bottom of page 
7 seven it said, you are referring to Michael Brown, 
8 you said that he had like one foot on the grass and 
9 one foot on the driveway, which you told us today. 
10 And then he turned around and he was like this. So 
11 that is why people thought he raised his hands, and 
12 I think you are talking there about people claiming 
13 that he had his hands raised. You said he did 
14 something like this, is that what you are referring 
15 to him looking at his body? 
16 Looking at his body. And I 
17 stated there they embellish, they embellish. 
18 Okay. 
19 He had them up, to make it 
20 clearer that he was giving up, they went from one, 
21 which is what I saw to something that they probably, 
22 they assumed he did and stuck them straight up in 
23 the air.

1 And so when you were 
2 demonstrating that he turned around and he had his 
3 hands like this, that is why people thought he 
4 raised his hands, you're talking about when he was 
5 looking at himself to try to determine whether he 
6 was injured? 
7 Right. 
8 Okay. And you said you went 
9 on page eight, you said he looked down and then he 
10 did this, and he looked at the officer and he walked 
11 and he took about three to five steps. He hit him 
12 again, pow, pow, pow. So you were demonstrating 
13 there again and then as you went on, Detective 
14 made an effort to kind of narrate the way you 
15 were demonstrating on the tape, do you recall that? 
16 Back on August 12th, when you were demonstrating for 
17 him he was kind of narrating back to you so it would 
18 show up on the tape, do you recall that? 
19 I believe so. 
20 Okay. On page 17 of your 
21 statement you said as he faces the officer, strike 
22 that.

2 And then you go on to page 18, and you say 
3 like this. And Detective says, kind of 
4 raised? And you say he had his hands up like this. 
5 And, of course, you can't see that on the 
6 tape so the detective narrates and he says, your 
7 arms are like palms up, and hands and fingers are 
8 roughly shoulder height, is that fair enough to say? 
9 You say, yeah, about close to his 
10 shoulder, yes, uh-huh. 
11 Not in the position that you 
12 got. 
13 Okay. 
14 When I said it, I said like

17 About shoulder height? 
18 About shoulder height. 
19 With palms up?
