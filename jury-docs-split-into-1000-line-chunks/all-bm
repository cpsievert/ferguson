1 GRAND JURY HEARING 
2 On Officer Darren 
3 Wilson's testimony he mentioned in the physical 
4 layout that Mr. Brown ran almost to a light pole 
5 before he turned around. Do we have a diagram with 
6 that light pole on it? 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I will have to look and see 
8 if it is included in the diagram. I'm sure there 
9 are pictures and videos that you will see, be able 
10 to see the light pole in those images and then if 
11 necessary, when we have a witness who is familiar 
12 with the scene, if need be, we could have them using 
13 our diagram, which has already been in evidence 
14 point out to you where the light pole exactly is. 
15 All right, very good.

MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(All jurors say good morning.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: This is Kathi Alizadeh with 
19 the prosecutor's office, present is Sheila Whirley 
20 with the prosecutor's office, all 12 grand jurors 
21 are present today, it is September 23rd, as well as 
22 the court reporter or the stenographer who is taking 
23 down what is being said. We are also recording, 
24 audio recording, that's happening in the grand jury 
25 right now.

1 I wanted to make some preliminary remarks. 
2 Now is the, in the next couple of days and a few 
3 weeks, I suppose, we are going to be hearing 
4 testimony from some people say that they are 
5 eyewitnesses of parts of this incident. And many of 
6 them have already had, been interviewed, all of them 
7 have been interviewed by law enforcement at some 
8 point. And as far as I can think of, almost all of 
9 them have been recorded by law enforcement as far as 
10 their interviews. 
11 As you know, we are recording, audio 
12 recording everything that's being said as well as 
13 taking down by court stenographer everything that is 
14 being said. 
15 That is an extraordinary thing that in my 
16 experience, we've never done before. And, you know, 
17 the proceedings in the grand jury are historically, 
18 have been secret and people who appear before the 
19 grand jury are testifying in secret and it is 
20 usually not disclosed that they testified or what 
21 they said. But in the interest of the public's need 
22 to know that this investigation is thorough and 
23 fair, my boss, Robert McCulloch, has decided to do 
24 this extraordinary thing, which is to record 
25 everything. And if there is sometime down the road

1 if there is ever an issue as to whether or not this 
2 investigation was thorough and fair, we will have 
3 those recordings to show exactly what was done. 
4 But as you can imagine, there are 
5 witnesses who are very uncomfortable who have 
6 information and are willing to come forward, but do 
7 not want their names disclosed on the record or 
8 where they live or, you know, their birthdate, any 
9 identifying information about them and that's 
10 understandable given what, you know, has happened in 
11 our community in the past month about, you know, the 
12 public's reaction to the incident and the 
13 investigation into this. 
14 And so because our goal is to get as much 
15 information as possible so that you can decide the 
16 facts in this case, we have decided that witnesses 
17 who do not want their name or identifying 
18 information about them to be on the record, we are 
19 not going to put that on the record. 
20 What we are going to do is when that 
21 witness comes forward, he will be sworn, he or she 
22 will be sworn, and then the court reporter will not 
23 activate the audio recording initially. That 
24 witness will then identify themselves to you by 
25 their name and where they live, although I told them

1 I'm not going to ask them for an address, mainly 
2 just south county, you know, I live in the Ferguson 
3 area, I live in north county, or what have you. 
4 And then those witnesses will be referred 
5 to, once they've given that identifying information, 
6 then I will have the court reporter start the audio 
7 recording at that point. So their testimony will 
8 still be recorded and the court reporter will 
9 transcribe their testimony, but they will be 
10 referred to by myself and in the court reporters 
11 record by witness number. 
12 Last night I made a list of every witness 
13 who has appeared before you so far and just for the 
14 sake of the record, we're just going to go 
15 chronologically with the live witnesses as they've 
16 testified. 
17 So if you recall who was the 
18 investigator with the Medical Examiner's Office, he 
19 was witness number one. Number two was Detective 
20 Number three was , although 
21 will have to come back because we had to cut 
22 him his testimony short, if you recall. 
23 
24 
25 
Number four was Dr. , the medical 
examiner. Number five, Number six 
was Sergeant with the Ferguson Police

1 Department. Number seven, Detective 
2 with the County Police Department. Number eight was 
3 Special Agent with the FBI and finally 
4 number nine, last week, was Darren Wilson, the 
5 Ferguson police officer. 
6 So we will continue to call witnesses and 
7 give them a number so that if they do not want to be 
8 identified on the record we will refer to them as 
9 witness number 12, 15, you know, what have you. 
10 Urn, we are not going to do that for 
11 witnesses who have been on the media because those 
12 people have chosen to put themselves out there in 
13 the public eye, they've identified themselves by 
14 name, they're on TV, so those witnesses will, their 
15 names will be on the record. I'll ask them their 
16 name and, you know, where they live and in the 
17 general vicinity where they live. 
18 The other issue is that because we are 
19 going to be playing recorded statements that these 
20 people have made, and many, in fact, most of these 
21 recorded statements, the statements begin with the 
22 witness giving their name, their date of birth, 
23 their social security number, their address and 
24 sometimes, you know their cell phone numbers. 
25 And, again, I believe that probably in the

1 case of every witness, that information probably 
2 should not be made public. I think it is okay for 
3 the witnesses who have been on the news for their 
4 names to be out there, but probably not their social 
5 security numbers and their exact address and cell 
6 phone numbers. 
7 So for that reason, when we begin playing 
8 a recording of a witness' statement, I will have the 
9 court reporter turn off the audio recorder in here. 
10 The statements are, they're already on disc, they 
11 are marked as exhibits, so we have those statements. 
12 I will make a record that I'm playing 
13 Grand Jury Exhibit, you know, so and so. I'm 
14 playing the statement of Witness Number 12, who off 
15 the record was identified by us as, you know, by 
16 name and so then we will stop the audio recording to 
17 play the audio interview that is on disc. 
18 In most of these cases we also have 
19 transcripts of the recordings that we will pass out 
20 to you and then the court reporter will also have a 
21 transcript so he can, that will assist him in taking 
22 down what's being said, but he will also be 
23 instructed, you are instructed that at some point 
24 we're going to have to redact that information from 
25 the transcript. You and I can discuss that later,

1 but you know, the whole purpose of this is so that 
2 we can, you know, keep people, people's private 
3 information private. And in the case of people who 
4 don't want to be identified for fear of 
5 reattribution, we need to keep them, I guess, 
6 unidentified, at least on the record. 
7 Does anybody have any questions about that 
8 process is or how we are going to do that? We're 
9 going to kind of have to work out kinks as we go 
10 because I had a discussion at length with other 
11 people in my office last night about how we were 
12 going to go about doing this. So we're going to see 
13 how it goes, I guess. 
14 So, for 
15 instance, these witnesses who are being identified 
16 for us at least, does that mean if this were to go 
17 to trial that they would not appear, only this 
18 portion would then be presented in a trial or they 
19 may potentially be required to present themselves? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: If this matter were to go 
21 to trial, I mean, first of all, it is not something 
22 that you should all really worry about too much. 
23 Your job is not, I don't want you guys thinking 
24 about what is going to happen after you all make 
25 your decision. You can't be affected by that.

1 But in the constitution, everybody who is 
2 in trial has the right to confront and cross-examine 
3 witnesses who give testimony against them. So, you 
4 know, the constitution will not allow us to put on, 
5 you know, unidentified witnesses. 
6 I know you probably have all seen on 
7 television when there are proceedings televised, 
8 they will black out the witness' face, but that is 
9 just for television. 
10 In a courtroom setting, that witness' face 
11 is not blurred, obviously. So you will understand 
12 that that's not something that you have to, I mean, 
13 that's not a part of your decision process. 
14 Whatever happens after this, we will deal

16 we are going to proceed. 
17 So when 
18 we get to the end of everything, all the 
19 proceedings, these audios that we are doing, they 
20 will be made public? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: That is a decision that we 
22 have to wait and see. My boss, Mr. McCulloch, has 
23 made a public statement about his intentions. 
24 Obviously, if this case, you know, that I can't say 
25 for sure. I know he has made public statements at

2 cannot say and again, that's one of the reasons why 
3 you all are referring to yourselves by juror number. 
4 Your identities will never be disclosed. So that's

9 normally don't ask questions. You understand what I 
10 was trying to explain about the process? 
11 I will give you one later when you are 
12 actually doing your transcript. 
13 Any other questions? 
14 So our first witness of the day is not 
15 here yet, but we are going to go ahead and start 
16 playing discs that we have that are statements that 
17 he has made previously. But what you are going to 
18 hear, and I hope he's just running late, but the

1 young guy was at the Ferguson police car on the

3 some arms exchanged and that's when I call my 
4 fiancee for her to look out the window and, urn, 
5 that's when I ran into the front outside, and that 
6 when, urn, I see, actually, it was two guys. 
7 Urn, when, but the guy, he constantly, he 
8 just ran down in the middle of the street and the 
9 officer just gets out the car and shoots. 
10 I thought it was six times. So, urn, when 
11 he, when he hit, I guess when he hit the first and 
12 the second time, the guy, he kinda stopped and 
13 turned around facing the officer, uh, bent down a 
14 little bit curled up, and the officer let out, what, 
15 three, maybe four more shots to the guy and that's 
16 when he hit the ground and, urn, and that was it and 
17 that was the whole thing. 
18 And he actually had a friend, he, I don't 
19 know, I just seen him duck down, a car, urn, they had 
20 a car door open, it was a white car, urn, he hopped 
21 in, I guess those two cars left.

7 that he was black, urn, he had dreads.

18 about not recording the audio statement because he 
19 did state his date of birth and address, we will 
20 have to deal with that and see if that can be 
21 somehow redacted. For this next statement he makes,
