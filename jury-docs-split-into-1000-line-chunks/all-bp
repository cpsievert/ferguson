3 that's when I went outside. 
4 MS. So you say the officer was 
5 shooting, how do you know he was shooting at that 
6 time? 
7 Cause that's when I heard the 
8 gunshots when he's out the vehicle, the moment he 
9 gets out the vehicle. 
10 MS. So what did you do when you 
11 heard gunshots? 
12 I'm still in the window and, 
13 urn, he's shooting, he's walking past his own vehicle 
14 to the back of it. And urn, like I said, the first 
15 vehicle that the guy with the dreads run to, that 
16 vehicle is a little bit behind the police cruiser. 
17 So he walks past that vehicle to where his 
18 friend ran to and walked past that and that's when

6 I mean, like I said, I never

19 Urn, the moment I gets outside, 
20 Mike Brown is now facing the officer and he got both 
21 his arms on his stomach, like bent down. So I'm

1 assuming that he was hit down here somewhere cause 
2 he is like this, urn, curled up. 
3 I remember him taking like two small steps 
4 because he kind of ran past his death spot where he 
5 passed away at, he kind of ran past that. When he 
6 turned around, he got his arms on his stomach, he 
7 bent down, I remember him taking like two small 
8 steps cause he was going like stumbling. 
9 
10 
MS. Okay. 
So, uh, and the officer lets 
11 out four or five more shots at him and he hit the 
12 ground. 
13 MS. So, just so that I will be a 
14 little more clear, I know I keep asking the same 
15 things. When you go outside, you see Michael Brown 
16 facing the officer and you were demonstrating, would 
17 you mind standing up and describing where his hands 
18 were at in the area for the recording?

1 just see him gets out of the car shooting, you know, 
2 and I'm paying attention to the guy with the dreads. 
3 Cause I'm thinking that he could just easily walk 
4 over and shoot him dead. Like I didn't want to miss 
5 that or something like that, you know. 
6 So it is just, that was just my timing 
7 right there like when I notice that he walked past 
8 the car and that was just my timing right there bam, 
9 he just got done like with a pause or something 
10 because I said when I gets outside, it was still 
11 like three, four, maybe five more shots.

13 you got outside, what was the kid with the dreads 
14 doing?

21 stopped paying attention to him so, and I started 
22 focusing on Mike Brown cause now he's dead, and the

8 actually see him, the kid with the dreads, get in 
9 the car or did you assume he got in the car? 
10 I, I, I assume, I assume that 
11 because the car was gone right after that, the car 
12 was gone. 
13 MS. And where were -- and did the

15 him?

18 MS. Right. You figured that,

10 MS. Can you just talk about who was 
11 around you? I know you said you were narrating it, 
12 there are people in the background. 
13 Yeah, like I said, it was a 
14 guy on that parking lot already in a burgundy, maybe 
15 a burgundy Bonneville. Him and his girlfriend they 
16 was already sitting out there and they were just 
17 talking. 
18 And I remember him saying something that 
19 the officer reversed back and ran over his foot, but 
20 I remember him saying like on a recording that I 
21 assumed that he just ran into the car and got to 
22 punching on him or whatever, you know, but he said 
23 that he ran over, that he reversed back and ran over 
24 his foot and tried to grab him through the car 
25 window.

No, I never seen him before. 
Have you seen him since? 
No. 
When this discussion is

7 Yes. 
8 MS. So the recording you provided 
9 St. Louis County, was it from the balcony? 
10 Yeah, it was from the balcony. 
11 MS. Okay. So just help me 
12 understand that. When I watch that recording, it 
13 seemed like, and what you just told me was on the 
14 recording. The person in that car, that burgundy 
15 car down below talking up to you? 
16 Uh, you know, I can't even 
17 remember. I don't know if he came up or not, like 
18 on the steps wise. So I really can't remember. I 
19 really can't remember. 
20 
21 
MS. You say a burgundy car? 
Yeah, yeah, I know that when I 
22 went out there onto ground level, that's when I was 
23 really talking to him, but I'm trying to remember 
24 like if at the time when I was recording on my 
25 balcony, if he walked up to the steps, cause I do

10 Yeah, right in front of my

12 Gotcha.

14 MR. You indicated initially when 
15 you went to leave your window and go out to the

2 front door. 
3 MR. All right. 
4 So I was headed, I took some 
5 large steps too, I don't think I missed too much 
6 from that. 
7 So when you said you saw the 
8 officer get out of the car. 
9 Uh-huh. 
10 Did you see what kind of car, 
11 vehicle, he was driving, what type of vehicle 
12 rather? 
13 Urn, it was definitely a truck, 
14 the Tahoes, the Tahoes. 
15 Okay. So when he got out of 
16 the car, and the Tahoe is a pretty big car. 
17 Yeah, yeah. 
18 suv. 
19 Uh-huh. 
20 You could see the officer and

22 Yeah, I could just see his

7 His body position? 
8 Yeah. 
9 Over by his car? 
10 Yeah, basically from like his 
11 chest on up. 
12 Okay. 
13 So I didn't -- I could see 
14 like see his gun too, but not like his stomach on 
15 down to until he got past. 
16 Okay. 
17 You know, so. 
18 And you heard the gunshots? 
19 Yeah, that's when I started 
20 hearing the moment he gets out of the vehicle. 
21 I'm sorry, I can't remember 
22 if you said this, do you know how many? 
23 How many he shots? 
24 Uh-huh, before the pause?

1 Are you guessing? 
2 That should be about four, 
3 five. 
4 Okay. 
5 Yeah. 
6 MS. If you're not sure, it is fine 
7 to say you're not sure. 
8 Okay. I know it was a nice 
9 round because he gets out of the car immediately and 
10 started shooting, just like I said, each time that 
11 he shot, I was like I said, I feel for the guy with 
12 the dreads. I think of it as a nightmare too 
13 because each time he saw the officer shooting, he 
14 was just like, you know, kind of like, I seen his 
15 body jump just looking at each time like he was like 
16 a duck that he was giving hisself around the 
17 vehicle. So I would have to say about four or five. 
18 MS. Okay. Do you remember when you 
19 first talked to the County detectives, you gave a 
20 recorded interview and a couple minutes later, you 
21 had a follow-up right away and they went back on the 
22 recording, do you remember that? 
23 Urn, with them? 
24 MR. It would be on the same day, 
25 August 9th. It was about four or five hours after

1 all of this happened that day they came and they 
2 talked to you? 
3 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was that 
4 same day. 
5 MS. You gave a recorded statement 
6 and literally within a minute, maybe even seconds 
7 later they went back on the recording. Was there 
8 something that you had asked that you said I wanted 
9 to ask you about. You had said in talking about the 
10 initial altercation, you had said that, urn, that you 
11 heard the shots before the police officer got out of 
12 the car and that's what made the police officer get 
13 out of the car. 
14 So I know that since then and today that 
15 you heard the shots after the cop got out of the 
16 car. Now one point you said that, that is what I 
17 was just wondering. 
18 Urn --
MR. You said, what is 19 
20 referring to, Detective asked you, when did 
21 you hear the first gunshots, you said you heard 
22 gunshots. 
23 You said, I was in window. And Detective 
24 asked you, and where was the officer at that 
25 point.

1 And you said that he was still in the car, 
2 that's when I saw the altercation, whenever it was 
3 happening in the car and the guys ran. 
4 And so at that point you indicated the 
5 first shots were while the officer was still in the 
6 car. 
7 And let me ask you this, kind of, you 
8 mention at the very beginning, I meant to ask you 
9 this earlier, but that the guy with the dreads and 
10 Mike Brown took off running at like the same 
11 instant. 
12 Uh-huh. 
13 MR. Is that right? They both 
14 just took off running at the exact same time? 
15 Uh-huh. 
16 MR. And you hear or seeing 
17 anything that would cause--
18 That's the point, I didn't 
19 even hear a gunshot go off while the officer was in 
20 the car, you know. So like I said, I really didn't 
21 hear. The only thing I heard was a hard tussling, 
22 you know. So that is what drew me to the window, I 
23 could hear everything because it echos, so I could 
24 hear everything, but that is what drew me to the 
25 window.

1 But they did take off at the same time, 
2 but I really, I didn't think that maybe a shot went 
3 off in the car or something because that was a good 
4 timing, you know. 
5 
6 because as 
MS. The reason we ask you is 
just read to you the transcript of 
7 your statement, you said at that point that the shot 
8 had gone off in the car. 
9 Yeah, maybe, I mean, I know 
10 for sure I didn't hear a shot go off in the car, 
11 but, urn, like I said, that's probably wasn't like 
12 the first interview, that's maybe because I'd have 
13 heard that a shot did go off so, you know, I was 
14 trying to put a puzzle together too, maybe that's 
15 the reason why they ran, but I didn't hear. 
16 MS. So there is about four hours 
17 from the time this whole incident occurred to that 
18 the time that the county cops interviewed you. In 
19 those four hours, I know that you videoed a lot of 
20 it, or people on the street, did you talk to your 
21 neighbors, kind of talk --
22 No, because a lot of people 
23 are my neighbors, they didn't see everything. They 
24 didn't see, it was just a main guy got, uh, from 
25 what I saw I kind of, you know, I like his beginning

When you talked to him, did the 
8 two of you kind of piece this together? 
9 Urn, like I said, he saw the 
10 whole thing basically, but I pieced his with mine. 
11 MS. You say he saw the whole thing, 
12 and he never gave you his name?

No, huh-uh. 
Do you know how to find him?

17 the vehicle. 
18 MR. Can you just real quick, can 
19 you tell us what he told you again about what he 
20 saw? 
21 That he said, urn, urn, that the 
22 officer pulls up to them and the officer says 
23 something to them and they say something back, and 
24 he reverses back and like I said, that's why the 
25 police cruiser is in the middle of the street

1 diagonal because he cuts Mike Brown off. 
2 And he said that he runs over his foot to 
3 catch him or whatever, he said that he reached out 
4 the window to hold him or whatever, and, urn, and 
5 maybe that's where the tussle started at. Going on 
6 maybe to let him know or whatever he, maybe he was 
7 punching on him in the window, whatever the case.

MR. Did he say anything to you 
about a gunshot while the police officer was in the 
car? 
I I really don't --
MR. Or did the officer say 
something about that to you? 
I don't think that he did, I 
17 think somebody else said that, somebody else that 
18 walked up and said that a gunshot, that's the reason 
19 why they ran so fast so, but I don't remember that 
20 the guy with the purple car that said that to me. 
21 MR. And so as you sit here 
22 today, do you know whether the first shot was, 
23 whether you heard the first shot while they were, 
24 while the police officer is still in the car or 
25 after he got out of the car.

2 when he gets out the vehicle. 
3 MR. Okay. And this individual 
4 that you talked about who told you what he saw 
5 before you actually started looking out the window, 
6 you didn't see any of that, the police officer pull
