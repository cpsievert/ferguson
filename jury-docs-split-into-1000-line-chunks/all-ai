3 this and were trying to figure out does this apply 
4 to the scene? Does it not apply to the scene? I 
5 had noticed it and considered I better document it. 
6 After I photographed it, somebody came up to me from 
7 the department and goes hey, just so you know, 
8 Darren was told during roll car to get his car 
9 washed because the sergeant saw the handprints on 
10 the back window. 
11 It was obviously deemed at that point 
12 not of evidentiary value to us, but I had already 
13 photographed it, so the picture shows what I took. 
14 Q So had you thought that might have some 
15 relevance, you would have maybe tried to lift a 
16 print off of there? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
I would have done a number of things. 
I don't want you to belabor it, you didn't 
19 act any further on this handprint because it was 
20 told to you it was there earlier in the morning? 
21 A Correct. We did nothing other than the 
22 three photos that you just saw. 
23 
24 
Q 
A 
Okay.

25 the vehicle itself. I think if I remember the time

1 limit correctly, we were told that the tow truck was 
2 close trying to gets its way down Canfield so we can 
3 tow the vehicle away. 
4 Image 67. Same thing. Just overall 
5 image of the vehicle before we were getting ready to 
6 tow it. 
7 Image 68. Right before this image 
8 was taken, my chain of events kind of got scattered. 
9 I would have typically have continued photographing 
10 the vehicle and then once it was towed I would have 
11 taken a picture of where the vehicle was at right 
12 after it had been removed. 
13 Someone, I'm not sure who, be it 
14 family member or someone in the crowd, had tore down 
15 some crime scene tape and a few people ran into near 
16 the crime scene. The decision was made then that we 
17 needed to stop our order of events, how we typically 
18 process a scene and we needed to get the body 
19 photographed and get the body moved immediately. 
20 Typically what you would see in the 
21 beginning of the photographs were I had the overall, 
22 the intermediate and close-up view of each 
23 individual piece of evidence, that got thrown out 
24 the window. 
25 We not quickly ran down, but we had a

1 large crowd that had gathered now at the end of the 
2 crime scene near Michael Brown. The apartment 
3 buildings that you can see on either side, one in 
4 the front, there is one obviously behind me where 
5 I'm taking this picture. Those were filled with 
6 residents on the three stories of the stairwells. 
7 There were people on roofs, people had started to 
8 line the crime scene from the side not being 
9 blocked. 
10 What we decided on doing is the 
11 medical examiner, I think the fire department that 
12 was there had sheets and some tarps that we were 
13 going to use because the crowd at this point were 
14 starting to chant, kill the police, numerous other 
15 derogatory things towards everything about us. And 
16 we fully expected another, I don't want to use the 
17 term riot, but an outburst once we did uncover the 
18 body and begin to move it. 
19 We made the decision to use the 
20 sheets and tarps the best we could to block the view 
21 of everybody that was trying their best to get in 
22 the crime scene and see what was going on. 
23 Several officers that were there, I 
24 would say probably 10 to 15 officers grabbed the 
25 body screens, sheets, and tarps, and not just held

1 them on the ground, but held them up above their 
2 heads because the apartment buildings were very 
3 close to where we were at. 
4 It is hard to really get a 
5 perspective from this view how close those buildings 
6 were to the scene. We had people on the third floor 
7 apartments that could see straight down, and people 
8 on roofs that could see straight down. 
9 So we had people in close proximity 
10 of the perimeter of that body holding screens to try 
11 to block us while we're working and still trying to 
12 protect the crime scene as well. 
13 Q So this blocking maneuver I'll call it 
14 that you did, was this done so that you were hiding 
15 some of the things that you were doing or was this 
16 done so you could avoid inciting the crowd with what 
17 they see when you remove the sheet? 
18 A It was strictly done to avoid any type of 
19 emotional response that we were expecting to happen 
20 when the body was uncovered. 
21 Q You also refer to the medical examiner 
22 being there? 
23 A It was medical examiner field 
24 investigator, not one of the pathologists.

8 be the overall view, this would be just the 
9 intermediate view of me stepping closer to the body. 
10 Again, just kind of drawing your attention to what 
11 we are getting ready to photograph. 
12 Image 70. This image, obviously, 
13 Michael Brown has been uncovered, the sheets have 
14 been moved from here to this end of the body, you 
15 can see now people's feet, which I would typically 
16 just out of habit try to keep people out of my 
17 photographs, but again, I'm standing in between 
18 policemen now, kind of my back against, with the 
19 scene secured and kind of collapsed down on top of 
20 us to shield the public's eye. 
21 Image 71.

23 A Yes, I'm sorry. Just like I would

1 trying to show you. I do the same thing with a 
2 victim or Michael Brown. 
3 So before I was standing over here on 
4 the right side of the picture looking this way, now 
5 I'm looking at his feet, I'm standing on the eastern 
6 end looking to the west. 
7 Image 72. Same thing, the previous 
8 image I was standing probably on the double yellow 
9 line, now I've moved slightly to the south and again 
10 you can see the feet of the policemen that are 
11 standing around holding the screens. 
12 Image 73. I'm on the south side of 
13 the street looking north and again just kind of an 
14 overall intermediate view. This picture in 
15 particular you can see that I cut off part of his 
16 foot in the photograph. 
17 Q You mean out of the frame of the 
18 photograph? 
19 A Out of frame, I did not cut part of his 
20 foot off. In the photograph his foot is out of the 
21 frame. 
22 Q You see the white sheet is still above his 
23 head? 
24 A Yes. Image 74. Corrected the previous

1 Image 75. An overall view, again, I 
2 put in the center of the overall view kind of where 
3 I'm going with the next information so this would be 
4 in our processing of the scene. We do as many face 
5 shots and identification shots as the body is found. 
6 Q Now, when you are processing a death 
7 scene, is it common place when you first see the 
8 body and document it that there might be evidence of 
9 medical intervention, people that might have been to 
10 a scene and tried to provide medical aid to a 
11 victim? 
12 A Yes, ma'am, anything from people being 
13 intubated with a breathing device, to clothes being 
14 removed for CPR purposes, to just the simple EKG 
15 type of devices attached to the feet to check to see 
16 if there is a heartbeat. 
17 Q In your experience in those circumstances 
18 that when there is some type of medical 
19 intervention, when the medical personnel are done, 
20 they leave those devices at the scene? 
21

12 injury defect to it. 
13 Image 79, what I would determine an 
14 intermediate view of his right hand and the defect. 
15 Image 80. Moving farther up the 
16 right arm, that would be a defect injury to his 
17 right forearm. 
18 Image 81. This would be kind of 
19 moving back again, as far as my perspective because 
20 I'm starting to show the tattoo and injury to the 
21 inside part of his right arm.

23 inside of his right arm, all of these series of

1 images that were requested by the detectives after 
2 they had spoken with Darren Wilson and we kind of 
3 had a brief, we had his first initial statement they 
4 requested these photos as part of his statement. He 
5 had said that Michael Brown had come back towards 
6 his direction with a hand stuck into his waist band,

19 to the medical examiner. What we investigate on the 
20 body at the scene is very minimal compared to what 
21 they do at autopsies. If there was a knife sticking 
22 out of his hand, something that is protruding, I 
23 would have been able to see that and document that

MS. ALIZADEH: And break for lunch, is 
10 that all right with everybody? 
11 A Again, just overall view of the body, kind 
12 of the exact same position. This may be one of 
13 those things where my camera clicked twice. I know 
14 at this point there is some items sitting on his 
15 stomach, this is where the investigator from the 
16 medical examiner's office had removed some items 
17 from his pocket to show what he had in his pockets 
18 there. 
19 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, is it typical at a 
20 scene that do you ever go inside the pockets of the 
21 deceased person? 
22 A No, again, in the State of Missouri the 
23 deceased body belongs to the medical examiner's 
24 office in St. Louis County or to the coroner in 
25 different counties, however they are titled. Body

2 pockets, their clothing, everything. 
3 We, myself personally, never touch a 
4 body physically unless I'm at the autopsy and I'm 
5 fingerprinting the deceased or anything like that. 
6 But as far as searching of the body, that is 
7 strictly done by the medical examiner investigator.

9 searched the body of Michael Brown?

Yes. 
Did you see him remove items from his 
13 A I did. 
14 Q Did you see him place the items on, I 
15 guess, I would say the belly of Michael Brown? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Is that something that's typically done 
18 that the items were placed on the deceased body? 
19 A Given space and time, they are either 
20 placed on the body or if it is a large amount of 
21 things they would be placed directly next to him 
22 where I would photograph him and those items are 
23 just returned back into the pockets of the deceased.

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So you are still under oath, you

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so we're going to resume again with 
13 the remainder of the photographs that you took 
14 during your investigation of the crime scene. 
15 So you can resume with the next 
16 photograph? 
17 A Image Number 100. This is a standard 
18 photo that we take during any death investigation 
19 photograph of where the body was after it had been 
20 removed by medical examiner personnel. 
21 What you can start to see in this 
22 photograph are again the chalk markings we put in 
23 place while the body was still there for our 
24 measurement points. Also you can see an evidence 
25 placard here again, once we collect evidence, the

1 placard is left in place for us to measure and 
2 diagram from later. 
3 Q Now at this point, have you collected all 
4 of the evidence? 
5 A At that point we had collected everything 
6 that we had found. I had mentioned before in an 
7 ideal world you see the overall, intermediate and 
8 close-up view of each individual piece of evidence. 
9 The shell casings, projectiles and some other items 
10 of evidence that were around the body in the chaos 
11 of the gunshots being fired near us, people tearing 
12 down our crime scene tape and coming in, those shots 
13 were missed, the photographs, the images, I'm sorry, 
14 were not taken prior to us picking up those items of 
15 evidence. We got them out of there to protect those 
16 pieces of evidence and just didn't get photographs 
17 of them. 
18 Q But you did document them in your diagram, 
19 correct? 
20 A Yes. The last photo, the previous one 
21 that was up there you can see the evidence placard 
22 is still there. You will see it in some of the 
23 following photos too, you will see the yellow 
24 evidence placard still in place. 
25 Item of evidence won't be sitting in

1 front of it, but the placard is still where the item 
2 was located for measurement purposes. 
3 Q Now, something that we talked about this 
4 morning, and you and I had a brief conversation out 
5 there about something that you recalled, I asked you 
6 earlier when you were photographing the body of 
7 Michael Brown up close and going to start moving the 
8 body, uncovering it and moving it, you had officers 
9 that were shielding you with sheets and tarps? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And the body screens that you call them? 
Yes. 
I had asked you if that was done to 
14 conceal what you were doing from public view and so 
15 that people wouldn't see what you were doing? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And you had described that's not the 
18 purpose for why you were being shielded, was there 
19 any civilians who were allowed inside that shielded 
20 area once you uncovered the body of Michael Brown? 
21 A Yes, after we had put the shields up, the 
22 tarps and the sheets to block the outside people 
23 looking in from above our vantage point, Michael 
24 Brown's father, Michael Brown, Senior was allowed 
25 inside the crime scene and actually inside the group

1 of tarps to witness and observe what we were doing. 
2 That served multiple purposes, 
3 primarily to provide positive identification. Would 
4 be no different from any other homicide scene where 
5 we would have a family member provide us with 
6 identification once we do go in and uncover the body 
7 and everything else, just like the photographs that 
8 I showed you of the tattoos on his arms, those were 
9 things that the family told us to look for when 
10 identifying him, but it served no other purpose than 
11 letting him observe what we were doing and give us 
12 positive identification of his son. 
13 Q He wasn't allowed to touch anything in 
14 that inner circle as you called it? 
15 A No, ma'am, he stayed basically on the 
16 inner perimeter that we had created. 
17 Q Did he positively identify the body in the 
18 street as his son? 
19 A Not to me personally, but to the detective 
20 he was with, yes. 
21 Q Did he remain in that perimeter for the 
22 duration of the time that Michael Brown's body was 
23 on the street?

5 A Image Number 101. Same thing as before 
6 showing the 360 degree views of what we're looking 
7 at. Again, chalk marks on the ground that are 
8 labeled right foot, left foot, see the chalk marking 
9 there for the right hand and here for the left hand. 
10 Image 102. Same thing as before, 
11 north side of the street looking south again, feet 
12 and hand chalk markings. A couple things you can 
13 see in this photograph are number one, a pile of 
14 blue tarps on this side. Those are some of the 
15 tarps that we used to shield the view of the public 
16 that was around us. Wrapped up in there are some 
17 white sheets that were used as well to shield the 
18 views, not the ones that I know of that were used to 
19 cover the body. 
20 Also things that you see in this 
21 video here are, image right here is a box that we 
22 use to hold our placards and a large 250 foot yellow 
23 measuring tape. Just things we were getting ready 
24 to do the diagram of the scene.
