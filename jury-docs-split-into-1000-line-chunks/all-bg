And did you have a copy of that interview? 
Yes. 
And had you listened to it prior to your 
4 interview of Darren Wilson? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So now given that he's already given an 
7 interview with the county detectives, why is it that 
8 you decided to interview him again on the 28th? 
9 A As we do separate investigations, my 
10 investigation is a civil rights investigation. Part 
11 of that and what I do in investigating civil rights 
12 is violations under the color of law, which that's 
13 why we're taking a look at this shooting, is to see 
14 if Officer Wilson was in violation of his sworn 
15 duties. 
16 And because of that, he is a subject 
17 of an investigation and very important and we are, 
18 it is separate, excuse me, from a homicide 
19 investigation, what the county is conducting, so we 
20 felt it necessary to conduct a separate interview. 
21 Q And at the time that Michael Brown, I'm 
22 sorry, Darren Wilson was interviewed by the county 
23 detectives, was that before you all started 
24 conducting joint interviews? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.

1 Q And the joint interviews, is it time 
2 saving for detectives as well as less inconvenience 
3 for witnesses and so forth? 
4 A That main reason has to do with the fact 
5 you want to limit statements given to avoid 
6 inconsistency, because it is human nature.

Why is it that you didn't record this 
20 A It is not generally the FBI's policy to 
21 record. It was made, the decision was made since he 
22 already had a recorded statement as well, to not 
23 record an additional statement. 
24 Q During the interview, did you take notes

Correct. 
And 302 is just a number that is for that

11 
A

Yes. 
And so, again, in this scenario you are 
12 questioning him because he is the subject of a

14 correct? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes.

4 And then we went into August 9th, 
5 2014, where he was working a shift from 6:00 a.m. to 
6 6:00 p.m. Around noon, just before noon he received 
7 a call, a sick call he referred to it as. An infant 
8 who had a fever. While he was at that call he heard 
9 over the radio a call for a stealing in progress 
10 where, is it okay if I refer to my notes? 
11 Q Sure. 
12 A Sorry, I don't mean to look down. He 
13 heard it was at a market, he didn't hear which one 
14 and he heard a description over the radio saying the 
15 subjects were walking towards the QuikTrip, stole 
16 Cigarillos and one subject was wearing a black 
17 shirt. 
18 Wilson cleared that sick call because 
19 the mother and the infant were taken to the 
20 hospital. He cleared the call and he was going 
21 eastbound on Canfield. The sick call was in an 
22 apartment complex, I believe it is called 
23 Northwinds, and to get back to West Florissant, I'm 
24 sorry, west on Canfield. 
25 And as he's driving, he sees two

1 individuals in the middle of the road walking single

3 later at a later date as of the date of the 
4 interview as Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown. He 
5 didn't know them before.

that the other gentleman is Dorian Johnson, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q But during your interview, did he refer to 
them by name, those names then? 
A He did. 
Q But did you clarify with him that this 
14 was, were these individuals he had ever heard of or 
15 had any contact with previously? 
16 A We did clarify and no, he did not. He did 
17 not know who they were prior to this interaction. 
18 Q Okay. So you say he sees these two 
19 subjects who he now knows as Michael Brown and 
20 Dorian Johnson, what happened next? 
21 A Dorian was first, so he pulled up next to 
22 him and asked him why don't you guys walk on the 
23 sidewalk. He made the statement, it wasn't in a 
24 confrontational way because he was more concerned 
25 about going back to the station to have lunch, it

2 Dorian's response was, we're just 
3 about to our destination, Dorian was not 
4 confrontational either. 
5 And Officer Wilson's response was 
6 okay, but what's wrong with the sidewalk. And 
7 Dorian kept, he continued to walk and Officer Wilson 
8 said he did not pay attention to Michael Brown and 
9 he was somewhat blocked. He has a big mirror, he 
10 was driving a Tahoe, so the mirror is quite large 
11 and Michael was blocked, he was just in that spot. 
12 Because he was interacting with 
13 Dorian Johnson, didn't notice Michael walking or any 
14 demeanor and so when he says okay, but what's wrong 
15 with the sidewalk, Michael says, "fuck what you have 
16 to say." 
17 I'm sorry, let me refer to my notes. 
18 Officer Wilson's attention was then drawn to Michael 
19 Brown and he noticed that Michael Brown's hands were 
20 full of Cigarillos. He looks in his rear view 
21 mirror and also saw that Dorian was wearing a black 
22 T-shirt. 
23 Thinking back on the call, Michael 
24 Brown was wearing a gray T-shirt and the call was 
25 they stole Cigarillos and one was wearing a black

1 shirt. So kind of putting two and two together or 
2 thinking that these might be the two guys, he puts 
3 the car into reverse. 
4 Q Now, when you say putting two and two 
5 together, is that what he was telling you that he 
6 put two and two together or is that your 
7 interpretation of it? 
8 A He said he recalled the description that 
9 came out over the radio. I think I'm using that, I 
10 don't know what you would call that, but yes, he 
11 said that. 
12 Q As much as possible because, obviously, 
13 you know, I don't want you to add to the statement 
14 or even interpret something that you believe he 
15 meant or said if he said it a certain way. So as 
16 best you can, stick with what he told you. So he 
17 said he recalled that earlier call about the 
18 stealing Cigarillos? 
A Yes, ma'am. 19 
20 
21 
Q And then what did he say happened? 
A He said he put the car, I'm sorry, he 
22 called over the radio said I'm on Canfield with two, 
23 send me another car, that's quoted. 
24 He then put his vehicle into reverse

2 from getting away, or walking any further. 
3 He said, Officer Wilson said his plan 
4 was to stall them until another officer got there. 
5 He was not going to try to arrest or even question 
6 either one of them because he was out numbered and 
7 incredibly outsized by Michael Brown. In fact, he 
8 quoted as saying, he would overpower me. 
9 So before Wilson gets out of his car, 
10 he tells Brown, come over here a minute. Wilson 
11 attempted to open the door and Brown, Michael Brown, 
12 shoved the car door back at him. 
13 And Michael Brown said to him, "what 
14 the fuck are you going to do about it." 
15 Wilson, Police Officer Wilson 
16 unsuccessfully tried to open the door again, Michael 
17 Brown ducked his head in because he was taller than 
18 the vehicle, ducked his head in down, came in 
19 through the driver's side window swinging his arms, 
20 he described him swinging his arms wildly at Wilson. 
21 He said Brown's right hand connected 
22 with the left side of his face. Wilson tried to get 
23 Michael Brown off him and also block the blows that 
24 were coming at him.

1 around and handed the Cigarillos that were in his

3 around and hit Officer Wilson in the face with 
4 Michael Brown's left hand. 
5 Officer Wilson describes going 
6 through what he described as a force triangle in his 
7 mind, and that is the way he said they were trained. 
8 He knew he could use one level of force higher than

2 He did not carry a taser, so that 
3 wasn't even and option. 
4 He had his asp baton on his belt and 
5 a mag flashlight in the passenger side. He said it 
6 would have given up too much of his body, Michael 
7 would of had to, could hit him more parts of his 
8 body if he tried to reach for either of those. He 
9 also couldn't deploy the asp baton inside the 
10 vehicle because it is collapsable. 
11 Wilson said he thought Brown could 
12 beat him to death. He knew from his training 
13 because for just that reason, he was allowed to use 
14 deadly force. 
15 He pulled out his gun and told Brown, 
16 stop I'm going to shoot you. Brown's response was 
17 and I quote, Officer Wilson quoting Brown, "you're 
18 too much of a pussy to shoot." 
19 Brown grabbed the gun and twisted it 
20 down pointing at his left hip. And Officer Wilson 
21 attempted to raise the gun with Michael's hand on it 
22 and aimed, he described he aimed at the silhouette 
23 of Michael Brown through the car because he could 
24 not raise it. He couldn't pull the gun high enough 
25 to go through the open window.

1 that there was blood on his right hand and he 
2 assumed that he had gotten cut when the glass flew 
3 everywhere. 
4 After the gun goes off, Brown stepped 
5 back from the car. He described somewhat in shock 
6 and Brown puts his hands together at his right hip, 
7 he demonstrated. And Officer Wilson thought maybe 
8 he was hit there, which is why he put his hand 
9 there. 
10 He said Brown then became enraged 
11 where Officer Wilson describes his face looking like 
12 a demon. 
13 Officer Wilson was confused that 
14 Brown wasn't then running away, knowing that 
15 situation, assumed that that would be to get Brown 
16 away from the door and to go because he had just 
17 been shot, but Brown re-engaged. 
18 And also at this point in time, 
19 Officer Wilson did not know where Dorian Johnson 
20 was. The last time he saw him was when he did the 
21 Cigarillos handoff. At that's when the rest of that 
22 time, the interaction, he never saw Dorian Johnson.

24 you saying that he says when he fired the weapon 
25 into the door, he believed or thought that the

1 bullet pierced the outer skin of the car and got 
2 Michael Brown, is that what you are talking about?

5 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
When you say that? 
Based off of his action, also he didn't 
6 know where the bullet went, but he was aiming 
7 through the door when Michael Brown is engaged in 
8 the car, he pulled both of his hands down towards 
9 his right hip and thought maybe that's where, if he 
10 was hit, just based off that action not because he 
11 saw a wound and not because he saw blood. 
12 Q Okay. And so then, what happened you said 
13 that he then described his face as looking like a 
14 demon and he is confused as to why he wouldn't have 
15 run away at that point. What happened then, what 
16 did he say then? 
17 A Both of the Brown's hands came back 
18 through the window. Officer Wilson just showed us 
19 his left arm up defensively trying to block Brown 
20 from punching him. 
21 Wilson put his, the gun up and pulled 
22 the trigger again, the gun didn't fire. He 
23 described what blind racking the gun, it is pulling 
24 the slide back without looking. I don't know what 
25 he, I don't know if he used his hands to rack it,

1 but he thought something had happened to the gun. 
2 He didn't know if the gun, he 
3 described it as stovepiping, which could be two 
4 bullets trying to go in and then neither will fire. 
5 He didn't know if he ejected a full cartridge, which 
6 would be the projectile along with the casing or 
7 just the spent casing was stuck in there, he didn't 
8 know, he didn't look. 
9 Q So he said he blind racked the gun, which 
10 he described as being the slide back? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Blind racking, he wasn't looking at his 
14 gun, his attention was to Mr. Brown. 
15 Q All right. You need two hands to do that, 
16 would that be fair to say? 
17 A He didn't demonstrate with hands, I'm 
18 demonstrating because that's how I'm trained. He 
19 could have also gone ahead, if I wasn't here, I 
20 could use this table, he could have used the 
21 steering wheel.

So you didn't ask him --
Did not. 
He didn't demonstrate how he blind racked

Correct. 
But his words were blind racked? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. So what does he say happens after 
5 he blind racks the gun? 
6 A He fired the gun again, he pulled the 
7 trigger again, the gun fired and he saw, and he 
8 wasn't looking where he was shooting he said, he saw 
9 a cloud of dust in the dirt across the street and 
10 assumed Michael Brown had not been hit because 
11 that's where he assumed the projectile landed. 
12 Q So did he tell you when before firing this 
13 weapon now, the second shot, did he tell you was he 
14 aiming in a particular place or was Michael Brown 
15 still beside the vehicle? 
16 A Yes, he was. He describes him, and again, 
17 because I'm not sure what hand, he just shows him 
18 blocking Michael Brown's blows with his left hand. 
Q Okay. 19 
20 A So after he fired that shot, that's when 
21 Michael Brown again ran away. Upon which time 
22 Officer Wilson called over the radio, shots fired, 
23 send me more cars. 
24 We asked because it is important 
25 later whether or not he called over his, there is a

1 radio in the car and there's a radio that he has on 
2 his person. So when you're inside a call car you 
3 can hear and also transmit. He's not sure if he 
4 said that with his car radio or with his handheld. 
5 Q He remembers making a call and those 
6 words, but doesn't know if it was the car radio or 
7 his mobile walkie-talkie? 
A Correct. 
Q And then what happens? 
8 
9 
10 A So Officer Wilson got out of the car to 
11 chase Mr. Brown because, and he describes because 
12 Michael Brown was a fleeing felon. And he was just 
13 doing his job, those were his words. 
14 He said Brown had just assaulted and 
15 attempted to kill him with his own duty, with 
16 Wilson's duty weapon. 
17 Officer Wilson did not want Michael 
18 Brown to cause injury or death to anyone else. He 
19 knew Brown would assault another responding officer 
20 or witness as Brown had just assaulted him. 
21 And Officer Wilson wanted to know, he 
22 wanted to give chase, he wanted to know where Brown 
23 was going. And in an attempt to apprehend Michael 
24 Brown once other officers got there. 
25 Q So let me stop you here. So this part you

1 are testifying about he is basically explaining why 
2 he thought he was justified in pursuing the subject, 
3 correct? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Was that in response to questions that you 
6 asked him directly or were you just letting him 
7 narrate this and this is information he just 
8 provided in a narrative form? 
9 A That was in direct response. It is 
10 possible, and the way my notes are written, I go 
11 back and write and try to chronological order. He 
12 could of at first give us the rundown, said what he 
13 did and then we would go back and say why. 
14 In my notes I tried to put it in 
15 chronological order. So he went and gave chase and 
16 I put in my notes in that same spot why, when we 
17 asked him why. 
18 Q Okay. And that was his explanation you 
19 already testified about. And then what did he say 
20 after he explained why he pursued the subject? 
21 A He explained that he expected Michael 
22 Brown to run for a while. So when he got out of the 
23 vehicle he did still have his gun in his hand, but 
24 it was down at his side because it is easier for him 
25 to run instead of having it pointed at Michael

1 Brown. And also because Michael was running away 
2 from him, he did not feel he was an immediate threat 
3 to keep his gun pointed on him. 
Q Okay. 4 
5 A As he was running after him, he told 
6 Michael get on the ground, get on the ground. And 
7 again, he said he thought Michael was going to run 
8 for a while. 
9 While he was running, Officer Wilson 
10 noticed a line of three cars lined up behind him, 
11 specifically he noticed a green Pontiac. He said he 
12 did not fire any shots at Michael Brown as Michael 
13 Brown was running away. 
14 At some point, a short time after 
15 Brown stopped and turned around to face Officer 
16 Wilson. Officer Wilson will describe Brown as 
17 grunting, he grunted, hopped and began toward 
18 Officer Wilson. 
19 When Brown hopped, he said he put his 
20 right hand in his waistband. At the time Officer 
21 Wilson didn't know whether or not he was armed. He 
22 thought that perhaps Michael Brown was armed and 
23 that's what he was going for. 
24 He couldn't tell because Brown's 
25 shirt had hung over his waistband. He said Brown's

1 left arm, left hand was clenched in a fist at his 
2 side. 
3 Wilson shouted stop, get on the 
4 ground, and Wilson explained at this point during 
5 the interview that Brown was just not listening to 
6 any of his commands. 
7 Wilson started shooting as Brown ran 
8 towards him. Wilson shot more than once, but was 
9 unsure how many times. And he realized he had 
10 tunnel vision, so he shot more than one time and 
11 realized that all he was looking at was that right 
12 hand. 
13 Wilson, I'm sorry, he said during 
14 this string of thoughts, Michael Brown had jerked 
15 back as if he had been shot, but Officer Wilson did 
16 not know where Michael Brown was hit. 
17 Q So he doesn't describe seeing, like what 
18 we see on TV, pow, pow, immediately blood spurt and 
19 you would see it on the shirt, he doesn't describe 
20 seeing anything like that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No, he didn't. 
Okay. Did he say anything other than, you 
23 know, you said he has testified before he had made 
24 that motion towards his waist like perhaps he shot 
25 him through the door, did he say anything else about

1 him making, appearing to be shot anywhere else? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
No, he didn't. 
Okay. You can go ahead. 
4 A He said after Michael Brown kind of jerked 
5 back, he said Michael stopped briefly, but then 
6 started running towards him again. He described 
7 Michael Brown's chest as being puffed up. Michael 
8 Brown's hands were still in his waistband. 
9 So Officer Wilson began to back up. 
10 Brown was about eight feet away from Wilson when, 
11 and Wilson thought to himself, if he gets me, I'm 
12 dead. 
13 Brown ran towards Wilson with his 
14 head leaning down. Officer Wilson thought he only 
15 shot one time, but it could have been more. 
16 He saw the bullet hit Michael Brown 
17 in the head and he saw Michael Brown fall to the 
18 ground face first. He said Michael Brown fell with 
19 such, because he had such momentum going forward, 
20 that when he landed on his face, his feet came up 
21 behind him. 
22 Officer Wilson made a statement all 
23 he had to do was stop and Officer Wilson would have 
24 stopped shooting. 
25 At no point did Michael Brown comply

1 with Officer Wilson's command or his order to 
2 surrender and Michael Brown never had his hands up. 
3 We had Officer Wilson draw just on a 
4 white sheet of paper a simple depiction of the scene 
5 and we are going to keep that with our case file. 
6 After Michael Brown went to the 
7 ground, he called over the radio on his handheld and 
8 said, "I need a supervisor and everyone you've got." 
9 While Officer Wilson was running 
10 after Michael Brown, he was looking around for 
11 people because he was concerned with, he didn't know 
12 if Michael Brown had a gun, he was concerned that 
13 other people might get shot in the crossfire. 
14 Q Wait a minute. So he kind of backtracked 
15 in his statement a little bit.
