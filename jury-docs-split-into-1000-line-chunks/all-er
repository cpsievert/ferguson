7 A No, I went down past a few streets first. 
8 Q Are there apartment buildings or 
9 businesses or restaurants or do you recall? 
10 A I don't remember. I just remember I went 
11 down and went past a couple of streets on, I believe 
12 it was the right-hand side. 
13 Q Why would you go past those streets, why 
14 wouldn't you turn around, you turned onto Canfield 
15 so that you could turn around and go back to 270, 
16 didn't you? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q You didn't turn around when you had an 
19 opportunity to turn around? 
20 A I don't -- yes, correct. I don't make U 
21 turns in the middle of the street and I don't pull 
22 into people's driveways. When I realized the 
23 apartments were there, originally, I thought I was 
24 just going to turn around in the parking lot and 
25 decided to ask for directions again.
