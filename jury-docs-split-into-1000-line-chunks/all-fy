8 everything, the next step in DNA is called 
9 extraction. Basically all that's doing is purifying 
10 the DNA. The cells have a lot of proteins and other 
11 debris that we're not interested in. So the 
12 extraction part gives us a clean DNA sample. 
13 Quantitation is the next step. I 
14 just mentioned that a minute ago. Again, we are 
15 trying to estimate how much DNA is there. This is 
16 important because we have a target range that we're 
17 trying to get to. We have a target number of copies 
18 we want to get to. 
19 If we have, for example, a blood 
20 stain that has a lot of DNA in it, we might, 
21 basically, we need to use less of that to get to 
22 that target amount. Whereas if we have a swab of a 
23 steering wheel where maybe there is just skin cells, 
24 we probably need to amp a little bit more of that. 
25 So that step just lets us know how much to load into

1 our amplification. 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) What is this target, did 
3 you say target number? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Where does that come from? 
6 A Typically it is based on validation 
7 studies. There is something called developmental 
8 validation and then there's also internal 
9 validation. So internal validation is what I'm 
10 responsible for, any time we're bringing in new 
11 technology online. That number is determined during 
12 that process. 
13 Q Is this part of the accreditation that you 
14 determined, I mean, who determines what the number 
15 should be is I guess what I'm trying to figure out? 
16 A In our case, it would be me, since I'm the 
17 one performing the validation. So I look at data 
18 that's available in the community from the 
19 developmental validation, which is typically done by 
20 the manufacturer. And then we do additional testing 
21 to make sure that it works in our hands just like it 
22 does in the manufacturer's laboratory. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So you can see pictures of the instruments 
25 there. Number 4, the yellow, that's the thermal

1 cycler. And that's what does the copying. 
2 Basically it is just a heat clock, it heats and 
3 cools the sample for certain amount of time and 
4 certain temperatures. And it allows the DNA to be 
5 copied. 
6 And then the last step, the green, 
7 that's called the CE, capillary electrophoresis. 
8 Basically it's just a fancy term for the instrument 
9 that actually gives us the DNA profile. So it's 
10 able to separate out those copy fragments by size. 
11 And then also during the copying step 
12 there were fluorescent tags that were added. So 
13 that's what the instrument is actually seeing are 
14 those fluorescent tags. So it is able to give us a 
15 DNA profile tag. 
16 This is what a profile actually looks 
17 like. You can see there is green boxes above the 
18 peaks. Basically that is just the name of the 
19 location on the DNA that we're looking at. It is 
20 too small to read, but let's say D3, for example, 
21 that just means it is on the third chromosome. 
22 The other thing to note here, there 
23 is either one or two peaks under each of those 
24 spots. And that just goes back to what I was 
25 mentioning earlier about you getting half of your

1 DNA from your mother and half from your father. 
2 So that is how we are able to do 
3 paternity testing as well. If you have reference 
4 standards from the parents and the children, you can 
5 look location by location to see if those parents 
6 contributed the DNA to the child. 
7 Q At the bottom it says every person has a 
8 unique DNA profile except for identical twins? 
9 A That's correct, yes. Everyone on earth 
10 has unique forensic DNA profile except for identical 
11 twins. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And then the numbers under each peak, 
14 that's just how many times it's repeating. Some of 
15 them say 15, 16, that's what we call the genome 
16 type, that set of numbers, and that is what we 
17 compare to the reference standards. 
18 This is just a slide on touch DNA. I 
19 mentioned it briefly earlier. Touch DNA is also 
20 called trace DNA. Essentially, that's just when we 
21 are trying to obtain DNA left behind by contact with 
22 an object. 
23 So a steering wheel swab, for 
24 example, the handle of a knife, let's stay that was 
25 used in an assault, swab of sunglasses, earrings,

1 there is all sorts of things that we can attempt to 
2 get touch DNA on. 
3 There is a lot of factors that go 
4 into whether or not we can actually get a profile 
5 from that. The length of time that the contact was 
6 actually made can be a determining factor. The 
7 biology of the individual. Some people shed a lot 
8 of DNA, some people don't, and there is no way to 
9 predict that. 
10 If the individual is sweating and 
11 really worked up, then they are more likely to leave 
12 larger amounts of DNA behind. And also the surface 
13 of the item that's being contacted, so typically it 
14 is kind of like the opposite of a fingerprint. This 
15 might be a smooth surface, it might be great for 
16 fingerprints, but not as good for DNA. And that's 
17 really just a twofold thing. 
18 Essentially, when you have something 
19 like fabric, there is more friction that's going to 
20 be pulling cells off. And then there's also more 
21 places for the cells to kind of cling to and 
22 maintain and stay in there. 
23 Q With the touch DNA, someone's DNA profile 
24 may be on an item, but can you say whether it is 
25 saliva, skin cells, I mean, can you speak exactly to

1 what that bodily item is or not? 
2 A No. Forensic DNA profile is going to be 
3 the same throughout your body. So whether it's from 
4 blood or semen or skin cells, the DNA profile that I 
5 showed you a minute ago is going to look exactly the 
6 same. 
7 So screening test can kind of, I 
8 guess, illustrate, or maybe point to a probable 
9 source of the DNA, but the DNA profile itself will 
10 not indicate that.

We'll have to kind of press through these. 
These are just like pictures for us? 
These are just some limitations, we just

MS. ALIZADEH: And it probably is not 
2 particularly relevant in this case. The DNA 
3 degrades, so like you said, you can't tell when it 
4 was deposited, you know, we see on TV where they 
5 will dig up, exhume a body that's been buried for 
6 100 years they will do DNA on it. Is there any way 
7 to tell if the DNA is recent or fresh DNA, as 
8 opposed to something that's been degrading over 
9 time? 
10 A Well, there's certain things in the 
11 profile where you can tell if the sample has been 
12 degraded, but there is nothing to indicate 
13 specifically how long something has been degrading 
14 for or how long it has been in the ground or 
15 anything to that effect. 
16 Domestic incidents. So let's say, 
17 for example, husband and wife living together, wife 
18 stabs husband with a steak knife. Let's say we find 
19 her DNA on the handle, that's great, but since she 
20 lives in the house and handles the knife all the 
21 time, maybe she just ate a steak the hour before. 
22 So DNA is less useful in situations like that. 
23 Intent. So this typically has to do 
24 with sexual assault cases. Again, DNA profile is 
25 not going to tell us whether the sex was consensual

1 or whether it was a rape. We simply obtain a 
2 profile or we don't, that's all. 
3 We just talked about this a little 
4 bit. We can't determine what fluid the DNA profile 
5 is from definitively. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You use the word fluid, you 
7 can get DNA from skin cells, correct? 
8 A Correct. And then as we mentioned 
9 earlier, identical twins will have the same profile. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: What are those little 
11 things in the middle there? 
12 A Those are angry sperm. That has to do 
13 with the consensual sex or not. I always say it 
14 would be great if they looked like that under the 
15 microscope, but they don't. 
16 And then as Kathi just touched on, 
17 DNA can be degraded by environmental conditions, 
18 chemicals, like bleach. 
19 So in this case there was some DNA 
20 mixture obtained. I just wanted to touch briefly on 
21 what that is exactly. You can go ahead and hit the 
22 forward. 
23 Mixture is just where we have DNA 
24 from more than one individual on an item. Sometimes 
25 we have so many people on an item that we are not

1 able to discern any particular profile and we're not 
2 able to make any useful comparisons or inclusions. 
3 And then other times we have cases 
4 where maybe there's a large amount of DNA from one 
5 contributor, but the other people on the sample are 
6 not contributing very much. So we might be able to 
7 get a great result for the person who is donating a 
8 lot of DNA, but the minor contributors, as we call 
9 it, might be inconclusive because there is not 
10 enough there. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) If the minor person or 
12 the minor profile is too little to tell, you know, 
13 it is not a full profile, do you include or make any 
14 determinations whether or not that person can be 
15 included or excluded? 
16 A So it depends on, well, let me back up. 
17 The first thing that we do is when we get the DNA 
18 profile back, we actually perform our interpretation 
19 prior to looking at any reference standards. So we 
20 go location by location and look to see is the 
21 profile complete enough to be a comparison. And if 
22 so, what locations do we feel fully represent the 
23 DNA samples, so which location are conclusive. 
24 So after marking all of that out and 
25 making all of our interpretations, then we go and do

1 the comparison. 
2 So if we ran into a situation where 
3 a, let's say there's a minor contributor, but there 
4 is just not a lot of DNA from them, but the peaks 
5 that are there perhaps are consistent with a 
6 reference standard that we are looking at. Again, 
7 if the data is not of sufficient quality, then we 
8 would say it is inconclusive and we can't determine 
9 if they're there or not. 
10 If those peaks simply don't match 
11 that person, then we would do what's called an 
12 exclusion, and we would indicate that they're 
13 excluded from that sample. 
14 You know 
15 when we are born and take our footprints and 
16 fingerprints, do you ever have to go like back to 
17 the hospital and look up birth records or anything 
18 like that sometimes to determine? 
19 A No, we actually don't have access to that 
20 kind of materials. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I have a question. 
22 of course, testified before you about areas of a 
23 shirt that she swabbed and chose not to swab for 
24 trace DNA. And she testified about the bloody areas 
25 on a shirt and that she didn't swab those areas for

1 trace DNA. She said something about the DNA section 
2 from the blood would overwhelm the trace. So can 
3 you explain what that means? 
4 A Yes, so that exactly what we're talking 
5 about we are talking about here. If here's a huge 
6 amount of DNA from one person, essentially, that's 
7 going to do what we call preferential amplification. 
8 It just means that's going to be copied much more 
9 than the person that left the tiny bit of DNA. 
10 So if there is not enough there, it 
11 is not going to amplify up, so we might not be able 
12 to make a conclusive determination about that 
13 person. 
14 So I know we all have post-lunch food 
15 coma, but it is getting a little technical here, but 
16 this is just an illustration or what it actually 
17 looks like when we say major contributor. 
18 So you can see there is numbers, 10, 
19 11, 13, 16, 17, et cetera, you can see how some of 
20 those peaks are very distinctly higher above the 
21 rest of the peaks. So that's what we are talking 
22 about when we say major contributor. So the 10 and 
23 the 16 in the first location, the 11, 13, 17, those 
24 would be what we call minor contributor. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: And you mean those little

1 tiny peaks. 
2 A Yeah, those little tiny down at the 
3 bottom, correct. So, again, typically our 
4 separation is about four to one, that's where we 
5 would determine there is a major contributor. So 
6 when those peaks are four times higher than the 
7 people down in the graph. 
8 And then we can also have a major 
9 mixture where there is two people that are 
10 contributing a lot of DNA and then there might be 
11 just a couple tiny trace peaks from another 
12 individual. 
13 So everywhere you see the red M in 
14 those boxes, that's what is being called the major 
15 mixture. So the majority of the DNA is being 
16 contributed by those two individuals. 
17 So we can sort of treat that like a 
18 separate mixture from the stuff that's down in the 
19 graph. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: And I recall from your 
21 report, which I know we haven't passed out yet, 
22 there is places where you talk about a mixture of at 
23 least two people or a mixture of, so is it possible 
24 then when you say that it could be a mixture of more 
25 than two people?

3 is six people? 
4 
5 
6 
A 
A 
Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
Yes, in that scenario the report wording 
7 will say, there was a major mixture component of two 
8 individuals detected and then it will say an 
9 additional allele indicated a possible trace 
10 contributor or something to that effect. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So when it says that, 
12 that means that there is another profile there, but 
13 you just don't have enough? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. From the trace individual, yes. 
Okay. 
When we do our comparison and we find a 
17 probative match, probative just means something 
18 that's important to the context of the case. So it 
19 can perhaps disprove or prove key statements, et 
20 cetera. 
21 We do a statistical measure of that 
22 to give weight to that evidence or to that match so 
23 the jury can determine is this a really good match, 
24 a really strong match or is it just so-so. 
25 There is two statistical models that 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XIX November 4, 2014 
Page 164 
1 were used in this case. The first is called the 
2 RMP, random match probability. Essentially, what 
3 that's saying is it's looking at a single source 
4 profile, so from one individual, and it is saying 
5 how rare is that profile. How often would we expect 
6 to encounter it in the general unrelated population. 
7 If that profile reaches a certain 
8 threshold of rarity, we are able to conclude that 
9 the profile came from an individual that's listed in 
10 the case if they match. So we can say this profile 
11 is unique and it matches this particular individual. 
12 The second statistic is used for 
13 mixtures, so you just need a slightly different 
14 model when you are dealing with a mixture versus a 
15 single source sample. So the particular statistic 
16 that was used is called a likelihood ratio. 
17 Again, this is used when you can 
18 determine the number of contributors. So earlier I 
19 said a major mixture of two individuals. That would 
20 be a case where you could use the likelihood ratio. 
21 You can go ahead and forward it. I'll get a little 
22 bit more information on that in a minute. 
23 This is just a slide, again, on 
24 random match probability. So, again, the way that 
25 we are able to determine how rare a profile is in 
FAX 314-241-6750

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com

Page 165 
1 the population, we do what are called population 
2 studies. 
3 So, essentially, a sample is taken 
4 from the population of the United States in our 
5 case, and they look to see how often are certain 
6 genome types detected, how often are certain alleles 
7 detected. 
8 So think of it as a parking lot where 
9 you are looking to see how rare or common a certain 
10 car is. So if you have a parking lot, it is your 
11 driveway, you have only two cars in there, it is 
12 probably not enough, not a large enough sample size 
13 to say, okay, this is a rare car or not. It is only 
14 two, but if you compare that to, let's say, a 
15 parking lot at Busch Stadium, where you have 
16 hundreds of thousands of cars, you can probably 
17 determine, okay, I see 50 Toyota Camrys and et 
18 cetera. 
19 So you can determine approximately 
20 how rare or common a particular allele is. So 
21 that's what the statistics are based on are these 
22 population data basis. 
23 The more locations that we use, the 
24 more discrimination the profile is, that is the 
25 better able we are to differentiate one profile from

1 another. 
2 So this is just a little bit more 
3 information. This is what I was saying about when 
4 it reaches a certain threshold of rarity, then we 
5 can conclude that there was a common source. So the 
6 evidence stain matches the suspect, for example. 
7 Very often you will see in the media 
8 where you read newspaper accounts of trials and 
9 things, they will very often say that the, they will 
10 quote the statistic as being the chance someone else 
11 committed the crime. That's called the prosecutors' 
12 policy, there is actually a name for it because it 
13 happens a lot, but that's not what we are looking at 
14 here. No offense. They don't do that, they're 
15 good. Again, we are just looking at the rarity of 
16 profile. It has nothing to do with the context of 
17 the case or, you know, anything to do with innocence 
18 or guilt. 
19 And there's also a defense attorney 
20 fallacy, and that assumption is everybody else with 
21 the same profile has an equal chance committing the 
22 crime. DNA statistics have nothing to do with 
23 access to the scene or any of those factors. 
24 Go ahead. We pointed this out 
25 earlier, but DNA testing and testimony will not

1 indicate how a stain was deposited. Again, we're 
2 just looking to inform the jury as to the likelihood 
3 that the DNA from a crime scene sample matches that 
4 of a particular individual. 
5 This is a little bit on the 
6 likelihood ratio, that's the stat we used when we 
7 have mixture. Basically it is just a mathematical 
8 way of saying how much particular hypothesis 
9 explains the evidence. 
10 So let's say in a rape case, for 
11 example, one hypothesis might be that victim and 
12 suspect explain the mixture. And the defense might 
13 say, well, I agree the victim is there, it is a 
14 vaginal swab, let's say, but that's not my guy. It 
15 is some random guy. 
16 So the defense hypothesis would be 
17 the mixture is explained by the victim and some 
18 unknown guy. So, essentially, we perform a 
19 statistic that just weighs those two options and 
20 determines which one is more likely. 
21 And this is just a verbal equivalent 
22 of what that number means. So if you have a 
23 likelihood ratio of one to ten, it is limited 
24 support for that hypothesis. 10 to 100 is moderate 
25 support, on and on. Anything over 10,000 is very

1 strong evidence is to support that hypothesis. 
2 This is just a real quick summary of 
3 what we do. Obviously, we interpret the profiles 
4 first, then we compare it to any reference 
5 standards. If there's a probative inclusion, we 
6 give statistical weight. We complete the report and 
7 then we submit it to technical administrative 
8 review. 
9 So there's a second qualified analyst 
10 that's required to review everything in the report.

1 then the next slide is the second report. I don't 
2 know if you can even read that, but it is a summary. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: I can pass out --
4 MS. WHIRLEY: That report is Grand Jury 
5 Exhibit Number, the first one is Number 73. 
6 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 73 
7 marked for identification.) 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: That's Q1, I think bottom 
9 K2, I will have you explain what those symbols mean. 
A Okay. 10 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
12 74, that's a supplemental report to the first one. 
13 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 74 
14 marked for identification.) 
15 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So basically you get the 
16 items, for example, the person that was here earlier 
17 who did the screening for DNA, she didn't do any 
18 analysis, she just checked the swabs, did a report, 
19 forwarded it to your DNA section? 
A Yes. 
Q And then what do you do? 
20 
21 
22 A Urn, so I go through the process that we 
23 outlined earlier where I process the sample, I 
24 obtain a DNA profile, I perform my interpretations 
25 and then I perform my comparisons.

1 Q Okay. So we're passing out the reports 
2 that you prepared, these are reports that you 
3 prepared, correct? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q And tell us what the Q1 and the K1 and 2, 
6 what does that mean? 
7 A Sure. That's the item designation that's 
8 given in the laboratory. So that would be what 
9 designated it as. 
10 If you look on the first page of my 
11 report, there's in parentheses after each item, it 
12 says Item Number, for example, Q1-1. At the end it 
13 says Item Number 3 and that's referencing crime 
14 scene designation. 
15 Q Okay. And on her report, I don't have it 
16 in front of me, let me look and see. Like when she 
17 does, I have it, thank you though. Her report where 
18 it says Q1 specimen, now yours says us Q1-1. Tell 
19 us about that, what's the difference? 
20 A Yes. So any time an item is separated or 
21 a sample is taken from an item, it gets a new item 
22 number to distinguish it. So Q1 would have been the 
23 T-shirt and then Q1-1 just means that she took a 
24 sample from that item. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And what is the K1 and K2?

2 designations for known. So in this case PO Wilson 
3 is K1 and Michael Brown K2.

Q 
A 
Q 
You actually have their DNA sample? 
Yes. 
Buccal swab for the officer and blood for 
7 Michael Brown? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
All right. And as I mentioned with the 
10 lab biology person was here. On your report it also 
11 has victim suspect. That's not anything that you 
12 made a determination of; is that correct? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 Q How does that get that designation? 
15 A We process it as it was submitted by the 
16 investigating agency. 
17 Q 
18 suspect?

So it comes to you from the police victim 
(Nods head.) 
All right. Looking through items examined 
Elmo, in addition to what we are looking 
are the same thing, correct? 
Yes. 
Okay. What items did you 
of an evidentiary value?

1 evidentiary value, do you know what I mean? 
2 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What do I mean? 
To me it means probative value. So 
5 potentially proving or disproving statements or just 
6 anything to be potentially probative. 
7 Q That's exactly what I mean. What did you 
8 analyze that was of evidentiary value? 
9 A Well, I can list the items that I list 
10 statistical calculation on. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Urn, so Q5 was the palm of Michael Brown's 
13 left hand, swabs from his palm. 
14 Q What did you observe, tell us about your 
15 analysis about his palm and Q5, it would be on the 
16 second page of your first, of your three page 
17 report? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Marked Grand Jury 73, and it is the palm 
20 of Michael Brown's left hand? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
And RBS means what? 
Red brown stain, something that would have 
24 tested either presumptively or confirmatory in 
25 biology for blood.

Q What was your conclusion about that? 1 
2 A The DNA typing results obtained from Q5 
3 are consistent with being a mixture of two or more 
4 individuals. This profile can be separated into a 
5 major component profile consistent with Michael 
6 Brown and a minor contributor. 
7 There was an additional allele that 
8 indicates a possible trace contributor, but again, 
9 that was inconclusive. 
10 PO Wilson is included possibility 
11 minor contributor profile. So then the next 
12 sentence is the likelihood ratio where it is giving 
13 weight to that statement. The observed mixture 
14 profile is 98 times more likely if it originated 
15 from Michael Brown and PO Wilson than it originated 
16 from Michael Brown and an unknown individual in the 
17 general unrelated population. 
18 Q And that's kind of, I don't want to say 
19 confusing, when you say 98 times more if it 
20 originated from Michael Brown and PO Wilson. So you 
21 are not confirming that it did originate from those 
22 two? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Okay. So how is it probative of anything? 
Urn, so in this case generally with any 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XIX November 4, 2014 
Page 174 
1 case when you have DNA from a particular individual 
2 and another individual, then it's potentially 
3 probative. So if there were accounts that there was 
4 a struggle and we find DNA from individual A on 
5 individual B, then it's probative. 
6 Q Okay. We know it is Michael Brown, 
7 correct, as the major contributor? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q And are you saying that it's more likely 
10 that it is PO Wilson is the minor contributor? 
11 A That's correct, then if it were an unknown 
12 person in the general population. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: You all have questions on 
14 that? Okay, all right. 
15 
16 A 
What else do you have? 
So moving down. Q11, this was tissue from 
17 the driver front exterior door. 
18 Q Okay. 
19 A There is several items in this particular 
20 sentence. You want me to list those out before I 
21 read that? 
22 Q Yeah, that is on page two of three. Okay, 
23 go ahead. 
24 A Yes, it is about the third paragraph from 
25 the bottom. So Q11 was the apparent tissue from the

1 vehicle. Q12 was the driver rear passenger exterior 
2 door of vehicle 108, that would have been PO 
3 Wilson's vehicle. 
4 Q13 and Q14 are reddish brown stains 
5 from the roadway in front of 2943 Canfield. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A So all of those items Michael Brown is the 
8 source of those, of the profile obtained from those 
9 items. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Did you do any numbers on that one? 
Yes, I have the actual statistic is listed 
12 farther back in the DNA report. Would you like me 
13 to read that? 
14 Q Yeah, if you would. 
15 A This would be in the larger stack of 
16 things that we made copies of. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: , is it on the third 
19 page of your report where it says conclusion based 
20 on the calculated frequency? 
21 A That's an informational statement that 
22 says what the threshold is, but the actual number is 
23 back in this report, which is what I'm looking for 
24 here. 
25

1 A So I mention earlier that we have, 
2 basically these databases are based on samples of 
3 the population. So the database that we use has 
4 four ethnic groups; Caucasian, black, Hispanic and 
5 Asian. So there is four numbers that you will see 
6 in this report. This is on page 42 of the notes. 
7 Q (By Ms. Whirley) They don't have those. 
8 A Okay. So, let's see. So this would be a 
9 rarity of 1 in 36 nonillion, which is a very large 
10 number. I actually have a chart here. Nonillion is 
11 10 to the 30th, so 30 zeroes behind it. So it goes 
12 million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, 
13 quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, 
14 nonillion.

Q 
How many people are in the world? 
Approximately 7 billion.

Yes. 
So this is many, many, many, many more 
20 times people than in the world?

1 Q 
Page 177 
All right. And this was blood that was, 
2 we are on Q11, that nasal mucus or tissue that was 
3 on the car; is that correct? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q And the driver rear passenger exterior 
6 door and the roadway at 2943, it says Canfield and 
7 looks likes two samples from that area, Q13 and Q14, 
8 all Michael Brown is the source? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 that. 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
What else do you have? 
All right. 
Q15, tell us about Q15, tell us about 
Okay. Sure. So this sample was from a 
15 reddish brown stain on the upper left thigh of PO 
16 Wilson's uniform pants. DNA from Q15 are consistent 
17 with being a mixture of two or more individuals. 
18 This profile can be separated into a major male 
19 component profile and a minor contributor consistent 
20 with PO Wilson. 
21 One additional allele indicates 
22 possible trace contributor. Again, that's 
23 inconclusive. Michael Brown is the source of the 
24 major male component profile connected from Q15. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And is this one of those occasions where

Page 178 
1 you talked about there could be more than two that 
2 trace, you can't say what that is, but it is not 
3 either of these two individuals? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q Okay. And then on Q16, since we are in 
6 that area. 
7 A Urn, Q16 was a swab from the top exterior 
8 left front door of the vehicle. The DNA typing 
9 results obtained from Q16 are consistent with the 
10 mixture of three or more individuals. This profile 
11 can be separated into a major mixture of two 
12 individuals, with a trace contributor, and the trace 
13 contributor is inconclusive. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A And then this is the likelihood ratio 
16 statistic again. Michael Brown and PO Wilson are 
17 included as contributors to this major mixture 
18 profile. The observed major mixture profile is 6.9 
19 million times more likely if it originated from 
20 Michael Brown and PO Wilson than if it originated 
21 from PO Wilson and an unknown individual in the 
22 general unrelated population. 
23 Q Okay. And you kind of explained that to 
24 us already.

1 Q And then for Q17, which was the exterior 
2 left front door mirror of vehicle 108, there was 
3 limited amount of genetic information to make any 
4 determination regarding the officer or Michael 
5 Brown?
