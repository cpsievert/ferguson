1 Q Did you feel that you didn't have 
2 sufficient time to complete your report at all? 
3 A No, I felt in terms of the adequacy of my 
4 report, I was done with it, the only thing that I 
5 wasn't finished with when I was told that I needed 
6 to finish the report was the histological section of 
7 tissue, that takes awhile for that to be processed. 
8 It can take four weeks sometimes, but I had to speed 
9 that along too. 
10 So I had to finish the bulk of the 
11 report, and then if you look at my last statement. 
12 I comment at the time, the histology examination 
13 will be issued as a supplemental report. 
14 That portion I was not able to 
15 include at the time of this. So this, until the 
16 histology, which I testified to you guys about this 
17 happened after I did this, so that's an additional 
18 important information which helped me understand 
19 better that gunshot wound to the hand. 
20 At this time, I was suspicious of it 
21 being a close range wound until histology came 
22 through, I couldn't definitively say. So in my 
23 report I say, hey, I see these, I see these 
24 discolorations, I have to my histology to confirm. 
25 So now I'm testifying I got that

A 
Q 
Yes, I will. 
And so I just want to make clear, this was 
14 done in a speedy manner, was there anything about 
15 this that you felt that if you had more time or were 
16 given, you know, more time to write your report, 
17 that it would be a better report or more accurate? 
18

A 
Q 
No. 
Did you just put everything else on the

12 my report, which would have been what, the 18th of 
13 that month. 
14 Q Until the officer picked up that report, 
15 you did not discuss this with any police officers 
16 what your findings were? 
17 A No, no one. The only people who were 
18 privy to what I was seeing, what I was dealing with 
19 were the officers who were in the autopsy with me, 
20 that's it.

3 MS. WHIRLEY: Good morning. Present is 
4 Shirley Whirley, Kathi Alizadeh, the 12 jurors and 
5 the court reporter. This is September the lOth, 
6 2014. This morning we are going to start out by 
7 watching a series of video clips that depict Dorian 
8 Johnson discussing what he saw as an eyewitness in 
9 this case. 
10 As you recall, Dorian Johnson was the 
11 person who was with Mike Brown at the time of the 
12 shooting. 
13 There is approximately six video clips 
14 that you will see. And once you see those videos, 
15 then we'll also provide you with a transcript and an 
16 interview. I think it is approximately two hours 
17 and 13 minutes, something like that, interview that 
18 Dorian Johnson gave to the FBI, and St. Louis County 
19 Police were also present. So you will hear his 
20 statement to them. 
21 And then after that, we'll likely break 
22 for lunch and when we resume in the afternoon, we 
23 anticipate that Dorian Johnson will testify. 
24 So with that bit of an introduction, Kathi 
25 Alizadeh is operating the laptop to get us started.

Just for explanation. 
This is audio. 
No, these are video. 
Okay. 
These are videos that 
7 on news outlets and some of them, some of these 
Page 6 
were 
8 clips contain other statements from other people, 
9 comments reporters have made about the incident. 
10 And as much as possible, I want to exclude those. 
11 So it will take me a second, I have my 
12 notes where we are starting and stopping on these 
13 and it will take me a second on each clip to get to 
14 that point. And then we will start it and you will 
15 see that clip. 
16 The only time you will hear from a 
17 reporter is when they're asking questions of Dorian 
18 Johnson, obviously, to understand his statement, you 
19 need to hear the questions. 
20 So as much as I can, I'm going to get to 
21 wherever I need to get. I'm hoping that when I hit 
22 this, we are going to see it and hear it.

3 that's the next number. 
4 This is a disc that contains video clips 
5 of interviews of Dorian Johnson and the first clip 
6 is on KTVI. The date of the interview is 8/9/14 and 
7 I'm starting this clip at one minute and seven 
8 seconds into the clip, and I am going to stop it at 
9 one minute and 20 seconds into the clip. None of 
10 these are terribly long. They are news clips. 
(We have a pause.) 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the record, we had 
13 a brief break because we were having difficulty with 
14 the audio. I think we have that resolved. So once 
15 again, and actually now this is starting at 106 and 
16 I will try to stop it at 120. 
17 (Playing the video at this time) 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So I stopped that at 120. 
19 Is there anybody that needs to see that again and 
20 hear that again? 
21 Yeah, I need to see it 
22 again. It looks like the volume was up kind of 
23 loud, I can't pick up what he's saying. If you 
24 would put that at like half.

And then this is the last clip. This is 
2 KSDK also on the 13th, I'm sorry, it was aired on 
3 the 13th. I think what you will see is that this is 
4 a part of an interview that was done, and you 
5 actually saw a part of the same interview in the 
6 third clip I played, which was aired on the 12th. 
7 So I believe this interview occurred on

2 Right now we're going to play the recorded 
3 interview of Dorian Johnson which occurred on August 
4 the 13th, 2014. An interview he had with the, an 
5 agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
6 also a detective from St. Louis County. 
7 This interview is approximately two hours 
8 and 13 minutes long. We provided you with 
9 transcripts of the interview. You can write on 
10 these transcripts if you wish. 
11 Kathi, did you have something else you 
12 want to say about that? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: At any time, you know, we 
14 discussed this during the break that if, since this 
15 is over two hours long, if anybody needs to take a 
16 break in the middle of it, let me know, I will try 
17 to find a place where it is kind of a pause to stop. 
18 And there was a question during the break 
19 by one of the jurors about whether you can ask 
20 witnesses questions when they testify. And I know 
21 you have been so far, but of course, that's true of 
22 any witness.

1 inquire of anything that you think is relevant and 
2 we want you to. 
3 Sheila and I will ask questions of 
4 witnesses as we have been going on. If at any time 
5 you want to inquire, anything is relevant. There is 
6 no, there is no objections to questions and we would 
7 have in a courtroom or anything of that nature, 
8 okay. 
9 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So with that being said, 
12 I'm going to play Grand Jury Exhibit 10, which is a 
13 DVD and it is an audio recording, and for the 
14 record, this DVD contains a number of interviews of 
15 other witnesses. And so for the record, I'm going 
16 to be playing the interview of Dorian Johnson and 
17 Sheila said the transcript of that interview is 
18 given to you. 
19 (Interview is being played at this time.) 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody want to take a 
21 break right now or keep going? 
22 It is 11:17, let's take about a five 
23 minute or so break and stand up and move around a 
24 little bit.

MS. ALIZADEH: It is 11:24 and I'm going 
2 to resume the playing of the interview of Dorian 
3 Johnson. 
4 (The interview is being played.) 
5 (End of the playing of the interview of 
6 Mr. Johnson.) 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: It is 12:13, I think your 
8 lunch is going to be here at 12:30. What I would 
9 propose we do because this is not going to take very 
10 long at all is that I have what I've marked as Grand 
11 Jury Exhibit 11. 
12 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 11 
13 marked for identification.) 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Which is another disc or 
15 DVD and it contains video from the Ferguson Market, 
16 the incident you heard Dorian Johnson talk about. 
17 They went in, got the Cigarillos and left the store. 
18 They are pretty brief clips. You want to watch them 
19 now since we have 15 minutes and then I thought 
20 during lunch, you also heard during his interview 
21 that he was drawing on some maps and we have copies 
22 of those maps. And also he made a drawing I can't 
23 find it in my office right now, I think Sheila might 
24 have one. 
25 I thought while you are eating lunch, you

1 can pass around those maps and look at them as you 
2 are relaxing if you want to. This will only take a 
3 couple minutes. You all right with me playing this 
4 now? 
5 So for the record a DVD, that on the DVD 
6 itself it says 14-43984, and it says video segments. 
7 There is no audio with this disc. 
8 (Video is being played at this time.) 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, for the record that 
10 was called register snippet and that was a view of 
11 where the cash register is and the counter is. 
12 So this next snippet, it is called door 
13 snippet. It is at the door of the food store, the 
14 convenience store. 
15 (Playing of the video clip.) 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Would anybody like to see 
17 those snippets again? And of course, you can watch 
18 them at any other time you wish. 
19 Can we ask you a 
20 question, both, either one of you a question about 
21 maybe we'll find out more later, but how this 
22 pertains or relates to the knowledge that maybe 
23 Officer Wilson would of had at the time? 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: You will hear some evidence 
25 about that.

2 MS. ALIZADEH: There will be, we have a 
3 lot of witnesses to call still. 
4 Okay. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: A lot of these things, it 
6 is difficult for us to, if we were in a trial, you 
7 try to put things on in order that people can make 
8 sense of it. But in a trial you make an opening 
9 statement so you can outline for the jury what the 
10 evidence is going to be. 
11 But we are not doing that here, and so you 
12 all understand you are hearing things and not 
13 knowing what's left to come. 
14 There will be, I believe, other witnesses 
15 who talk about that, so we'll just have to wait and 
16 see how that testimony comes in. 
17 Will we hear 
18 testimony any of witnesses inside the store to the 
19 events that happened in the store? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Possibly. Sheila and I 
21 have not made out our list. Our intention is to 
22 call as many people as we can. Some people may not 
23 be cooperative. We will serve subpoenas on people 
24 who don't voluntarily agree to come in. 
25 I don't know how else to explain that

1 other than we are going to have as many people as we 
2 can, that we think know anything about this coming 
3 in and testifying. So there will be many, many 
4 witnesses to come, all right? 
5 So at this time it is 12:23, if you all 
6 will just break for lunch and your lunch will be 
7 here in less than ten minutes. And the plan right 
8 now is shortly after 1:00, we'll give you an update 
9 of when we might start up in the afternoon.

So introduce yourself to the grand jurors? 
Good afternoon everybody. My name is 
12 Dorian Johnson, as you all well know. I'm thankful 
13 that you all could come, part of your busy schedule, 
14 I don't know if you all have anything else to do, 
15 I'm thankful you can come and hear my story. 
16 Q Thank you. Now, Dorian, I stand in the 
17 back of the room. I do that so that we can have a 
18 conversation and you will talk loud enough for even 
19 me to hear you. These mikes that you see, they are 
20 just recording, they're not really making your voice 
21 louder, so speak up for me, okay? We have a lot of 
22 fans in here to try to keep the room a little bit 
23 cooler.

A Correct, yes. 2 
3 Q You do have an attorney, your attorney is 
4 Freeman Bosley? 
A That's correct also. 5 
6 Q And he's outside sitting, he cannot be a 
7 part of the testimony, he cannot be in here while 
8 you testify, but he's outside and you know that if 
9 you ever want to take a break and consult with him, 
10 or talk to him, you have a right to do that.

Q 
Yes. 
That we just want to hear from you being 
22 the person that was with Michael Brown that day, in 
23 your own words, what happened, that's what we are 
24 here for. We are not here to prosecute you. You 
25 may tell us some things that have to do with

1 criminal behavior. I know there is an incident at 
2 the store, at the Ferguson Market. We will play 
3 that video and ask you to tell us what's going on 
4 there. 
5 There is some talk about smoking weed 
6 and those kind of things, but that's not anything 
7 that we are here to prosecute you for. I want to

Yes, ma'am.

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
All right. So with that said, let's talk 
16 about you knew Mike Brown, right? You call him Big 
17 Mike? 
18 A I'm going to ask if I can refer to him as 
19 Big Mike, that's the way it sounds funny saying if 
20 it is okay with the jury. 
21 Q Absolutely, I will call him Big Mike too

Page 20 
So tell us how you met Big Mike? 
I met Big Mike, I recently had, well, not 
4 recently, but I just moved in those apartments, I 
5 had me and my girlfriend, my daughter, we were 
6 staying in the apartment, two bedroom apartment, I 
7 had a roommate. I just moved over there. 
8 I only been staying in those 
9 apartments for about eight months. I met Big Mike 
10 around the fifth month that I was living there. I 
11 met him through a friend that I know from the area, 
12 neighborhood down the street where he lived. 
Q Okay. 13 
14 A So when he introduced Big Mike, they came 
15 to my apartment one day, they want to play video 
16 games, you know, relax and have conversation. And I 
17 didn't have a problem with that. 
18 So they came over, and when he came 
19 to my door, he was real quiet when he came in, you 
20 know, he was the biggest person in the room. So it 
21 struck me as kind of strange, I don't really be 
22 around people that I don't know. So I asked him a 
23 question, I was like, hey, how you doing. I live 
24 here, this is my house. 
25 And he spoke back to me, he said I'm

1 all right, you know. And he just kind of kept it to 
2 hisself. I felt that he was good, he was just a 
3 person that didn't speak a lot. So he was all right 
4 with me to be in my house. 
5 Q Did you socialize with him on a regular 
6 basis after that or how often would you say you was 
7 in his presence? 
8 A Like I said, it was my apartment, so you 
9 know, I had bills and things like that. I was 
10 working at the time of me first moving into the 
11 apartments. I recently lost my job around the sixth 
month, I met him in the fifth month, so now I'm on 
the verge of finding new work and finding a way to 
pay the bills. So I was not able to connect with 
him on a daily basis or even every other day because 
I'm trying to find work.
