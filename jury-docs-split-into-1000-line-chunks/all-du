Page 27 
Did the officer get out of his car right 
2 away or was there a few moments before he got out or 
3 do you recall? 
4 A As far as I can recall, after Michael 
5 Brown took off running, the officer got out of his 
6 car. It was pretty quick, you know what I'm saying? 
7 I couldn't say he sit there a long time, it was 
8 pretty quick he got out of his car. 
9 Q Okay. I'm just guessing, you tell me if 
10 I'm wrong. So if Michael Brown started running. 
11 A Right. 
12 Q By the time the officer got out of his 
13 car, Michael Brown had a little bit of a head start? 
14 A He wasn't that far away from him as far as 
15 I could remember. Michael Brown probably run about 
16 two and a half car lengths or maybe three, something 
17 like that. 
18 Q Okay. And so you said the officer had his 
19 gun when he got out of the car?

1 A As far as I can tell. When he got out of 
2 the door, he's in front of me and he had the gun 
3 down to the side of his leg like this, and you know, 
4 watching which way they run and he started to chase 
5

Michael Brown too. (indicating) 
Q Okay. So when you say he started to chase 
7 Michael Brown. 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Let's clarify also. Was Michael Brown 
10 running, was he walking? 
11 A He was running. And then it looked like 
12 he couldn't go no further, he stopped and put his 
13 hand on the back of the car. And I recall that car 
14 was brown or gold or something like that, as far as 
15 I can recall. 
16 It looked like Michael Brown, when 
17 he's coming toward Michael Brown, Michael Brown took 
18 his hands off the car and was coming towards the 
19 officer.

1 That's when I said, well, he must have got hit 
2 because that's all the further he ran. I know if 
3 somebody shot at me, I would run further than that.

Q 
A 
Q 
Sure. 
You know what I'm saying? 
So you only are guessing that he might

Yeah. 
The officer kind of got out of the car, he 
19 is doing this over here, looks like he was talking 
20 through his thing and Michael Brown was running 
21 probably from here to that young lady there. And 
22 he's coming behind him and look like Michael Brown 
23 just got tired all at once or couldn't run no 
24 further, put his hand on the back of the car. 
25 And then the police still coming at
