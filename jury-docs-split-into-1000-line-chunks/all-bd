Detective 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
And, I believe, Detective 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I believe you said in 
8 that statement that Officer Wilson told you that 
9 Michael Brown took off running and then he stopped 
10 and raised his arms and charged him? 
11 
12 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Did he indicate to you how 
13 he raised his arms, how Michael Brown raised his 
14 arms?

20 in a charging motion?

He knew he couldn't fight this man.

7 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. All right.

10 Officer Wilson ever say he saw any blood coming from 
11 the victim? 
12 A No, ma'am. Yes, sir.

14 Officer Wilson discharged his weapon, did he say how 
15 close they were in proximity, how close they were?

18 mentioned before that protocol that all officers

1 want to ask you, is there anything that you think 
2 this grand jury should know about this incident or 
3 that you know that maybe we didn't ask you. I don't 
4 want anybody walking away from here saying well, 
5 they never asked me that or anything like that. Is 
6 there anything that you think would be important for 
7 this grand jury to know that you haven't told them 
8 yet? 
9 A I've worked with Officer Wilson for two 
10 and a half years. He's been under my supervision 
11 that long. 
12 Darren is a very easy going 
13 individual, always has a smile on his face. Doesn't 
14 go trying to start trouble or look for trouble, does 
15 a good job. 
16 I have very little supervisory hours 
17 dedicated to Darren Wilson. He knows his job very 
18 well and he does it very well. 
19 My opinion, put in this 
20 circumstances, I don't know what I would have done. 
21 I probably would have done the same thing. 
22 So, I mean, Darren did not just all 
23 of the sudden go from trying to chase this guy down 
24 and take him into custody to deciding just to shoot 
25 him because. So, I mean, Darren is a good officer.

19 detectives to arrive, and I made contact with 
20 Sergeant who is a county police 
21 sergeant, St. Louis County police sergeant, assigned 
22 to North County Precinct. He was there within the 
23 crime scene, that's the first person I contacted.

1 Q Do you recall when you would have gotten a

3 A I believe the time was about 12:40, 12:43, 
4 in that area, is when Sergeant received the 
5 call. As it was, we were all standing together when 
6 he received that call and then after he got done 
7 with the phone call, he immediately dispatched us to 
8 the area.

1 much knowledge as we have at the time. 
2 He had advised me that the medical 
3 examiner had not been notified yet and that's when I 
4 requested them to do so. 
5 Typically the way that it works with 
6 our police department is the personnel from the 
7 division of patrol, which would be the uniform 
8 police officers are responsible for making that 
9 notification. 
10 So once I found out that that wasn't 
11 done, I immediately made that request. 
12 Q So when you arrived, the medical examiner 
13 had not been notified? 
14 A To my knowledge, no. Sergeant 
15 informed me that they had not been. 
16 Q How about EMS, the emergency personnel? 
17 A I was unaware if they had responded yet at 
18 the time. My main concern was making sure the 
19 medical examiner was dispatched. 
20 Q Because when you arrived, it was 
21 determined that Michael Brown was dead? 
22 A Yes. So if subject is deceased, then the 
23 next step would be to contact the medical examiner. 
24 Q Describe the scene when you arrived, you 
25 said it was 1:30-ish or so?

Yes. 
Describe the scene for us? 
As I arrived, I came down West Florissant 
4 and then turned, it would be east on Canfield Road. 
5 The entire street was lined with cars, both civilian 
6 cars and other police cars from St. Louis County. I 
7 believe there was a Ferguson car there and multiple 
8 other jurisdictions, to where I was unable to even 
9 make it to the actual crime scene. I had to park 
10 some distance away, I don't know the exact distance, 
11 but some distance away and walk up to the crime 
12 scene. 
13 Which is a little atypical than what 
14 we're used to. Typically we drive right up to the 
15 crime scene tape, park outside of it and then we can 
16 enter the crime scene there. 
17 There were multiple people, I can't 
18 quantify how many, but people were walking towards 
19 that area as I was walking up as well, and that's 
20 when I entered the crime scene. 
21 Q Could you hear people talking? I don't 
22 want to assume, was there a crowd, are you telling 
23 us, a crowed of people? 
24 A There were, I would say small pockets of 
25 people around the entire crime scene. When you ask

2 I just wasn't paying attention to it.

Q He was not at the scene? 
A Correct. 
Q Was it your job to make any contact with 
A Eventually it was. Essentially what 
12 happens in an investigation of any kind, is that the 
13 detectives will basically come together and a case 
14 detective will be assigned. 
15 In this case detective 
16 was the case officer. 
17 
18 
Q What does that mean, case officer? 
A He'd be essentially the person that would 
19 orchestrate and dole out assignments and be 
20 responsible for the investigation as a whole. He 
21 would be the one that would be writing the report 
22 and like I said, making the assignments for other 
23 detectives to do. 
24 Q So you were assisting in the 
25 investigation, he was the case agent or officer?

1 is an interview that is, it is detailed enough to

Do you tape cursory interviews?

12 the individual, and it is done so even not just a 
13 police officer involved shooting, we do them on 
14 almost every investigation. Just to understand what 
15 that person saw and what happened to better assist 
16 us within the scene. 
17 So that's kind of the reason we do 
18 that.

20 any evidence at the scene?

22 minutes and then I was dispatched to Ferguson Police

9 on the door, allowed entry by Lieutenant Colonel

1 Q Is that uncommon? Have you ever been 
2 involved in an officer involved shooting before? 
3 A I have not been involved in one, but I 
4 have investigated multiple. 
5 Q Okay. That was a better way to answer, I 
6 didn't ask the question right. Because you've never 
7 shot anyone, is what you are telling us? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
But you have been involved investigating 
10 those shootings? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is it customary for the person who was 
13 involved, the officer that is involved in the 
14 shooting to handle and package their own gun as 
15 evidence? 
16 A Well, with the St. Louis County Police 
17 Department it is something that's not done, however, 
18 we were called to investigate another police 
19 department's incident. So at that time we were 
20 unaware of any policies or procedures they have in 
21 place that when we get there basically we have to 
22 find out, I guess, and explore the possibility that 
23 maybe that's part of their policy. 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Did you explore that? 
At that time, no, I did not.

So you don't know what their policy is? 
Correct, I do not. I just knew that 
5 police officer Darren Wilson had told me that he had 
6 packaged the weapon and it was currently in that 
7 bag. Now, at that point in time I never checked to 
8 verify that, it was done later. 
9 Q Okay. In an investigation such as this, 
10 ideally what should happen with the officer's gun? 
11 A The way that, I can only speak to the way 
12 St. Louis County would handle it. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
Sure. 
Is that that officer would continue to 
15 have his weapon in his holster until a detective 
16 from the Crimes Against Person Unit, which is my 
17 unit, a supervisor and a crime scene unit detective 
18 would conduct what we call a download of the weapon. 
19 And that's an inspection of the weapon to determine 
20 how many rounds are left inside of the weapon. 
21 So what would happen is we would ask 
22 the officer to remove his weapon from his holster, 
23 the magazine would be ejected, we would count the 
24 number of rounds in the magazine, if there are any. 
25 Then we would ask him to move the slide to the rear,

1 which would eject a round if it was chambered, and 
2 what that means is there would be a round of 
3 ammunition in the barrel of the weapon.

5 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And then that would be photographed as 
6 those steps were taking place.

8 
Q 
A 
Would the gun be returned to the officer? 
No, the weapon would then be seized by our 
9 crime scene unit detective. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Until the investigation? 
Typically what would happen is that it 
12 would go directly to our firearm lab. They do a 
13 test fire, inspect the weapon and then at that point 
14 it would be returned to the police officer. 
15 Q Okay. So you're at the Ferguson station, 
16 you see a weapon, the officer is dressed in his 
17 uniform?

At that time, no, I did not. 
Did you see any injuries on the officer? 
I did. 
What did you see? 
I could see there was reddening to the 
right side of his jaw and it appeared that

Q 
A

Did he talk to you about any injuries? 
No, that's just what I observed when I met 
Just to clarify, I don't know if I've 
8 asked you this before, did you know Officer Darren 
9 Wilson before this incident?

Q 
Yes. 
Was at the Ferguson Police Department?

There was a decision made that he should

A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
How did that come about, if you know? 
To my knowledge that was a decision made 
21 by Lieutenant Colonel 
22 Q When you arrived in Ferguson, were they 
23 discussing that he was going to go to the hospital 
24 or did that come up while you were there? 
25 A From what it appeared, it was a

1 conversation that was taking place before and then 
2 continued as I arrived. 
3 So I heard basically the tail end 
4 that Officer Darren Wilson would go to the hospital 
5 and get treated. 
6 Q And what did that mean as far as your 
7 investigation was concerned? 
8 A The way I would handle it with anybody, 
9 victim, witness, suspect, anybody that we would talk 
10 to is that if they are requesting medical treatment, 
11 we would do that first, that's more important than 
12 any statement we are going to get. And we can 
13 continue the statement at the hospital, which 
14 happens regularly. That we would follow them to the
