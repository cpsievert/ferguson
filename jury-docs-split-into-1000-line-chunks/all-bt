A Because when I went down on the scene 
afterwards, speaking with that I was 
14 speaking to. I wasn't giving a thorough accounting 
15 
16 
on what I had witnessed to , I was, I couldn't 
say giving just a glimpse of what I witnessed 
17 because just observing the chaotic, how it got so 
18 chaotic so quick, and different point of views on, 
19 it didn't add up to what I actually witnessed. 
20 I felt very uncomfortable and I say I 
21 would probably estimate I was down on the scene 
22 maybe five to ten minutes. And just observing 
23 everything and how the uproar became about so

2 I felt uncomfortable, I fully felt 
3 uncomfortable when I actually did go forward to the 
4 police station because, urn, I first called in Sunday 
5 after I seen all the rioting. I just felt bad about 
6 the situation. 
7 I knew that I needed to come forward 
8 to let the truth be told. And after seeing the 
9 rioting, I called St. Louis County Police, I just 
10 called the 911 and they took down my information 
11 and, urn, Monday morning I just felt like it wasn't, 
12 I was just going to be pushed to the side. So I 
13 felt like I needed to do more. 
14 I called Ferguson Police Department, 
15 I had to leave a message there and I still wasn't 
16 settled about it. 
17 So I went down to the police station 
18 and I felt uncomfortable then just walking past all 
19 the protesting that was going on, but I knew it was 
20 the right thing to do. It is an unfortunate 
21 situation, but I know God put me in this situation 
22 for a reason.
