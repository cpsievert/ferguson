20 shoulder down and then down to the pubic area. When 
21 it is opened up, it permits examination of the chest 
22 organ, the heart and lungs, the abdominal organs, 
23 which -- and then that's sutured up afterwards. And 
24 then there is one incision, second incision is made 
25 from back of the, ear to ear, the back of the head

1 that permits removal of the tissue of the skin to 
2 bend them forward and take the brain out and examine 
3 the brain. 
4 And then when these sutures are, when 
5 these incisions are sewed up, this is universal. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A In other countries as well. When the 
8 incisions are sewed up, one can present the body to 
9 the family, clothing covers the chest incisions, and 
10 a pillow will cover the back incision so that in the 
11 normal course, one can tell by looking at the 
12 remains and paying respects whether an autopsy has 
13 been done or not. 
14 Q When you saw the body for the first time, 
15 it was sewed up, so you had to open it to do your 
16 autopsy?

23 the kind of things that funeral directors do when 
24 you go to a funeral home.

1 A And there's no special requirement and 
2 that he also then, he had seen the body before it 
3 was embalmed, you know, when it came there and he 
4 gave me, told me what it looked like before the 
5 embalming. I think he had some pictures of that, 
6 but I don't recall specifically. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A He was interested in trying to work out 
9 the different bullet tracks, which gave me some 
10 opinions about. 
11 Q But you made the determination of the 
12 bullet tracks? 
13 A Oh, yes. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I interrupt you for a 
15 minute. What you said that, who was interested in 
16 determining the bullet tracks, is that Mr. 
17 A Yes, he was a very enthusiastic young 
18 person. He was making suggestions to me, well, this 
19 bullet track that went in the head on the top and 
20 things like that, but my opinions are my own. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Sure. I just didn't hear 
22 who you said. 
23 A , he was the only one there besides 
24 myself, and also he could photograph. He had a 
25 camera and he took photographs of the autopsy while

1 it was being performed. 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Do you feel that your 
3 autopsy is independent of St. Louis County's autopsy 
4 or how would you categorize it? 
5 A It is independent of it sure, but I review 
6 what I could tell from the examination what St. 
7 Louis County Medical Examiner's Office had done. 
8 They had done a thorough examination and by 
9 examining, you know, status of the organs, all the 
10 organs have been dissected and placed in a plastic 
11 bag at the time and the bullet tracks were still 
12 apparent. 
13 Q Okay. 
14 A They weren't removed, the bullets were 
15 removed, but not the bullet tracks. 
16 Q So tell us what you did as you performed 
17 your autopsy and then we can maybe go through some 
18 photos if that's helpful or we can wait on the 
19 photos, so kind of tell us what did you do first 
20 when you arrived there? 
21 A What I did first was examine the outside 
22 of the body. And to examine the head, the front, 
23 the back is important to make sure that there was, 
24 there wasn't any kind of injury or perforation of 
25 the back that could be overlooked if one doesn't

2 Then a second autopsy often is easier 
3 than the first because the incisions have been made, 
4 the ribs have been cut through, the skull bones have 
5 been cut through to get to the brain. So in one 
6 sense it is easier, of course, it doesn't tell you 
7 as much as the first autopsy necessarily. Because 
8 the first autopsy has changed things around a bit. 
9 So in this situation, when I review 
10 the internal organs, they're pretty normal in 
11 appearance for the age and his build and all. 
12 There were bullet perforations of the 
13 right lung that then coincided, correlated with 
14 gunshot wounds on the outside of the body. A large 
15 part of the autopsy had to do with reconstructing 
16 what the bullet wounds were, where they entered, 
17 where they exited, and then to my interpretation two 
18 bullet wounds could have been reentry wounds. I 
19 couldn't be certain about those until I saw what the 
20 official autopsy showed, which is one I received 
21 recently, yes. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
And the photographs. So that was a large 
24 part of what I did is to determine the nature of the 
25 gunshot wounds and the direct entrance, exit,

2 Q That's what we certainly want to know 
3 about. 
4 So you open the body and you 
5 inspected the body for injuries and wounds, gunshot 
6 wounds and photographs were taken? 
7 A First thing I did, the biggest time was 
8 spent looking at the outside of the body. 
9 Q Outside of the body? 
10 A Before opening up the inside. 
11 Q Before we talk about any of the gunshot 
12 wounds, let's talk about other potential injuries. 
13 You may or may not have seen them. Did you see any 
14 bruising to the body, like bruises on the knees or 
15 anywhere on the body, did you note any bruising? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Can you tell us where you noted the 
18 bruising? 
19 A Well, I thought the significant bruising 
20 was around the right eye. He had a lot of bruising, 
21 I'm still not clear about how it developed, above 
22 the eye and on the side and below the right eye. In 
23 addition to the gunshot wound that went through the 
24 eye. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
So you think the bruising had nothing to

Page 33 
1 do, not nothing to do, was not from the gunshot 
2 wound that you are discussing? 
3 A No, there was a gunshot wound, I'm sure 
4 the people are familiar better than I am than what 
5 I'm talking about right now. There was one gunshot 
6 wound of entrance just right of the forehead or so 
7 and that went down and caused a lot of damage, went 
8 downhill through the eye and the orbit. 
9 In addition to that, there was 
10 scraping abrasions around the eye, bullet wounds 
11 don't cause scraping abrasions, rubbing abrasions 
12 against something. 
13 Q That prompts me to ask you, did you get 
14 any information as to the fact of what happened, did 
15 you get any witnesses' versions of what occurred 
16 during this shooting? 
17 A I did read an occasion when up in New York 
18 the controversy that was going on in Ferguson, some 
19 people, the hands were up, some people said he was 
20 charging the officer, so I was familiar with the 
21 controversy. 
22 Q Did you hear that he fell face forward 
23 once he has shot in the head, did you hear that? 
24 A I would assume that bullet wound in the 
25 head causes immediate lost of consciousness and

1 ability to stand upright. So he would have fallen 
2 after being shot in the head, yes. 
3 Q So if he fell face forward, would that 
4 account for the bruising that you are referring to 
5 or you don't think, tell us what you think? 
6 A I don't know. Probably, and to this day I 
7 don't know. Maybe I should have gone over to the 
8 scene to see the composition of the roadway that he 
9 fell on. 
10 But usually falling face down, for 
11 example, causes bruising of the nose. The face is 
12 kind of protected. We have, people normally, normal 
13 person falls face forward instinctively put their 
14 hands out to protect themselves. 
15 When somebody loses consciousness or 
16 somebody is drunk, you see this in people who are 
17 drunk, they can fall face forward and not 
18 instinctively protect themself. And then the 
19 bruising in the prominences of the face, the nose 
20 gets most of the damage. 
21 The eye sockets don't, they are 
22 recessed a bit. So I think that by falling face 
23 down, and then falling face down you get ruptured 
24 blood vessels and bruises being black and blue 
25 marks. Abrasions being scrape marks on the skin,

1 like your child falls down and skids along some 
2 ground, they can get scrapes. 
3 The scrapes are different than black 
4 and blue marks. There were scrapes here. So it 
5 happen to rub against something, it is rubbing of 
6 the outer layer of the skin. I don't think that 
7 would have occurred from an unprotected fall. And 
8 the nose was not that damaged either. 
Q Okay. 9 
10 A Just because you lose consciousness 
11 doesn't mean you fall immediately, it's just 
12 crumbled to the ground is more common, you crumble 
13 down and fall. Different ways of falling and that 
14 it was more scraping, not clear why. 
15 Q What about bruising to his, did you see 
16 any bruising on his wrists or his arms? 
17 A I saw one of the wrists had a little bit 
18 of a bruise that I'm not sure what it was caused by. 
19 Looks like he had something around the wrist that 
20 caused a linear abrasion of some kind. I didn't 
21 think very significant. 
22 Q Is that something you can tell whether 
23 that bruise occurred contemporaneously with all of 
24 these injuries or is this looking like an old 
25 bruise. I know most doctors say it is difficult to

1 date a bruise. Did it look like something that 
2 happened contemporaneously with all the injuries? 
3 A It could have, but it could have been 
4 there for a day before or something, not a week 
5 before. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A We can't tell a few minutes before death 
8 or a day before death by just looking at it. 
9 Sometimes under the microscope we can tell. But we 
10 could also, some of these injuries can occur after 
11 death, you know, when the person is put in a body 
12 bag and tied up in the body bag just so it doesn't 
13 move, that can leave patterns also on the dead body

1 A I know that's mentioned in the autopsy 
2 protocol. 
3 Q Okay. So let's look at some of the photos 
4 and you can tell us, first of all, you thought there 
5 was 17 shots that he received? 
6 A Seven different bullets that struck him. 
7 Q Okay. Tell us about that? 
8 A As oppose to bullet tracks. One of the 
9 tracks was a graze of the biceps of the arm and that 
10 came across the arm and didn't do any significant 
11 damage to Mr. Brown and it is very difficult to be 
12 able to tell direction from that. It was not close 
13 to, medical examiner is one to two feet or less. 
14 That is, we can tell distance, 
15 usually up to a foot or sometimes two feet, a foot 
16 and a half by the amount of powder that's 
17 distributed with the bullet. 
18 Beyond that, we can't tell two feet 
19 from 20 feet or 40 feet, you know, shot from 40 
20 would be the same marks and from 3 feet from a 
21 medical examiner's point of view. 
22

Q 
A 
Okay. 
So depending on the ammunition and the 
24 weapon discharged, 12 inches to 18 inches away

1 further away the powder spreads out, so that's how 
2 we judge closeness. 
3 Q Were any of the gunshot wounds that you 
4 observed, would you consider any of those close 
5 range shots? 
6 A Yes, the one in the hand is close.

8 from a gunshot wound?

11 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, yes. 
How did you make that determination? 
Well, I could tell, you know, when I first 
12 saw the body that's a typical graze injury of the 
13 tissues of the palm of the hand because graze 
14 injuries will look different depending.

21 are your photographs. I looked at these for the 
22 first time yesterday afternoon and they are very

2 this is Number 75. 
3 There's a laser pointer. 
4 A Can I just get up? If I can just go here 
5 if that's okay. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: I'll just put that over here 
7 in case you need it. 
8 A This is a photograph taken by the police 
9 after the body, after the hand has been washed. 
10 Now, when I saw this photograph, the hand, it was 
11 all gray and washed off and embalmed. And I could 
12 tell it was a gunshot graze just like the wound on 
13 the right biceps muscle, but not direction and not 
14 distance. 
15 In this photograph in looking at the 
16 print, which is sharper, there is some powder here 
17 around one edge of it. And it is an interesting 
18 photograph, can I see the next one? 
19 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Sure. Want me to put

1 graze wound is that the tearing of the skin tells 
2 you direction. So inverted Christmas tree. 
3 The fact that these are going upwards 
4 would indicate that the entrance is down here and 
5 going in this direction. Because of, if you see 
6 this Christmas tree this way and upside down 
7 Christmas tree is going that way, that's how the 
8 tissues tear when there's a graze wound in areas of 
9 some loose tissue that's in the palm of the hand 
10 kind of thing. 
11 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So the entrance where it 
12 entered is tighter than where it came out, it starts 
13 to spread?

16 
A 
Q 
A 
Yeah, but it is these things that tells. 
Okay. 
It goes in here and there is some on the 
17 print, there is a little bit of blackish, tiny bit 
18 of blackish coloration, and that's what the medical 
19 examiner found on the microscopic. It was 
20 interesting when I look at it, after the embalming 
21 because body gets washed and all of that, I couldn't 
22 see any powder. 
23 When the medical examiner looked at 
24 it in the fresh state, he didn't either because he 
25 puts in the autopsy that there's no gunshot powder

1 and then I didn't see any gunshot powder, he sees it 
2 under the microscope. 
3 When I look at this now and there's a 
4 little blackening there that I think is not due to 
5 any artifact, that's really blackening due to some 
6 powder. 
7 So that the weapon, the muzzle was 
8 near to this within a few inches, it wasn't contact, 
9 but within a few inches in my opinion at the time of 
10 discharge. 
11 Q Can you tell by that injury where the 
12 shooter and the person who was shot, what their 
13 positions were? 
14 A I can tell that the weapon, the muzzle of 
15 the weapon, in all of the reconstruction that 
16 medical examiners do, tell the muzzle of the weapon 
17 and the place the bullet enters where it is. So the 
18 gun had to be somewhere around, you know, that kind 
19 of a line, but I can't tell, we can't tell from an 
20 autopsy whether the hand is going forward or pulling 
21 backward or standing still. We can't tell whether 
22 the gun is going forward or backward. All we can 
23 say at the instant of firing, I would say roughly 
24 six, four, five, six inches away, the weapon was a 
25 few inches away at the time of the discharge and

1 struck. I wasn't able, I can't tell, the fingers 
2 could have been open or not open. 
3 But at this point the bullet would 
4 have gone at this point cut through the muscles 
5 here, and that's one of the things that would be 
6 important in reconstructing, which I couldn't get, I 
7 tried to, is the examination of the car was there a 
8 bullet in the car or a bullet imprinted in the 
9 vehicle to see if we knew where the bullet struck, 
10 then we get an even better lining up of what 
11 happened. 
12 Q Okay. There's two more photos, I don't 
13 know if they are helpful. 
14 A Yes, they are. 
15 Q This is Number 40, I'm saying this for the 
16 record, this is 49. 
17 A I thought that maybe in this photo there's 
18 a little better, a little blackening between the 
19 ridges, you can see the ridges in the skin and some 
20 little black soot deposit. That's what comes out of 
21 the bullet because when the bullet comes out, it is 
22 an explosion that pushes the bullet out and any 
23 explosion you get powder. You get carbon, soot 
24 carbon, and burned and unburned gunshot powder 
25 fragments.

It is your opinion 
This is essentially powder, so the heavy, 
3 and the powder would stay up until about four, 
4 five inches and then it goes away. 
5 Q Say that one more time, I'm trying to 
6 visualize. 
7 A When powder comes out of the muzzle of the 
8 gun, it goes for four or five inches and then it 
9 will dissipate. And the heavier tattooing would 
10 come from burnt, unburnt granules, not carbon. The 
11 blackening is carbon or soot. 
12 Q That's in your opinion that's what this 
13 is? 
14 A Yeah. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: Go ahead. 
16 You said you can't tell if

20 sitting or standing by this?

2 sitting or standing, no, that's all I can relate to 
3 is the weapon, the gun and the target. And I can't 
4 because the wrist is so mobile see, it could be held

Q 
A 
Yeah, this is Exhibit Number 42. 
Did it show, yeah, that one. This is how 
11 the photograph was taken by the police before the 
12 hand was washed and there is a lot of blood around 
13 here, that this wound does cause a lot of bleeding, 
14 a lot of little capillaries and blood vessels there. 
15 And that became important in looking 
16 at the clothing. Why does he have blood on his 
17 clothing, you get shot and you get shot multiple 
18 places and glass. If this happened very quickly, he 
19 wouldn't really have time for blood to stop dripping 
20 out of any of the wounds he had and he would have 
21 collapsed immediately. And I think the blood on his 
22 clothing and the drops of blood, dripping of blood 
23 on his clothing, which is the lower part of the 
24 shirt, the upper shirt is a lot of blood, his pants 
25 or the shorts that he was wearing have a lot of

1 blood drops on it. And the socks he has on he had a 
2 lot of blood, had blood drops on it. So that he was 
3 bleeding, the only place he could have been bleeding 
4 from is this area from here. 
5 My opinion is whatever happened after 
6 incurring that wound, he was able to have blood from 
7 here drip onto his pants and clothing and his socks 
8 in whatever he was doing, walking or whatever he was 
9 doing or running. 
10 Q Were you able, based on your examination, 
11 to tell which wounds happened first and what 
12 sequence of shots, what the sequence was? 
13 A The only thing I can say this was the 
14 first wound. I cannot tell the other sequence. 
15 
16 
Q Why do you think this was the first wound? 
A Because of the bleeding that occurred when 
17 he left the car and that he had incurred the wound 
18 in the car just from the history and that. 
19 At some point he received the other 
20 wounds, the wound in the head would have been, would 
21 have caused him to lose consciousness. 
22 Q And be fatal? 
23 A However that's probably the last, to next 
24 to last. If his head was down and would indicate 
25 because in order for the wound to be inflicted in

1 the head, top of the head, the muzzle of the weapon 
2 has to be, this is kind of the wound in the top of 
3 the head. 
4 Now that could be somebody is up here 
5 in the ceiling and shoots down, they can give me 
6 that. If I'm lying on the ground and the muzzle of 
7 the gun I can get that, or if we accept the position 
8 of the shooter, you can't tell unless you know the 
9 position of the shooter. 
10 If he's standing up, as appears from 
11 what I've read, assuming that, then his head would 
12 have to be down so that the shooter would have to be 
13 able to fire at the top of his head. 
14 And if he's down and he fired three 
15 fast, quick shots, which could occur before he falls 
16 to the ground, he would have one in the head, one in 
17 the forehead that goes down through his jaw and one 
18 in the chest that all occur with three quickly fired 
19 shots. 
20 So even though he crumbles, starts 
21 falling immediately on the one in the head, and 
22 probably could have been the last shot, if three 
23 shots were gotten off, it could be done before he 
24 falls to the ground and he would be in a position 
25 with his head down for those three shots to occur.

On the tip of his thumb

18 from that, be the barrel of the gun? 
19 A No, the barrel of the gun at this point I 
20 would expect more soot, well, I can't tell. The 
21 indentation I think is more postmortem. You can't 
22 say it happened before death because the body is 
23 moved, the skin, as I said, we find most common when 
24 tied up in the body bag or so, marks on the skin 
25 occur just from pressure, postmortem pressure can

shots one at a time and you prefer to

about the 
stand there? 5 
6 A Yeah. If you are going to do that, I put 
7 it so that the top one. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: I may have messed up your 
9 order. 
10 A That's okay. The way we usually do it, 
11 way we do it in New York, with multiple gunshot 
12 wounds, we will describe the wounds and number them 
13 from the top down. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A That doesn't in any way signify the order 
16 of shots, because usually we can't tell the order of 
17 shots. So the number one that was, I think also was 
18 in the autopsy report. 
19 Q You kind of describe the head shot 
20 already, correct? 
21 A Yes. 
22 Q And they've seen that shot, so is there 
23 anything else you want to say about that?

1 A And just that, even the head shot, even 
2 they had to take the hair off to show it, it didn't 
3 show any powder around it, which would be another 
4 indication that it was a distance away for what it's

MS. WHIRLEY: You have a question? 
Whose photographs are these? 
These are all photographs I saw for the 
24 first time yesterday that were taken by the St. 
25 Louis Police Department who came to the Medical

1 Examiner's Office and the police took them all, not 
2 the medical examiner, the ones I looked at initially 
3 were medical examiner photographs I said, and that 
4 was after the autopsy had been done. So the police 
5 were there and they took all of these photos before 
6 the autopsy was done. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: These are out of that 
8 packet of photos, Grand Jury Exhibit Number 7. 
9 A Now, in this one, can you turn that front 
10 light out. This is a bullet wound of entrance, and 
11 again, no powder around it. More than 18 inches 
12 away. Can't tell how much more, and the bullet 
13 track, thank you, came down through the orbit, the 
14 eye and caused some fractures and exited down here 
15 through the jawbone on the side. 
16 So that was also, see, that would 
17 have lined up, as I tried to figure out if he were 
18 bent over to have the top of the head and then a 
19 parallel line going down and exiting here. 
20 And when I spoke about the abrasions, 
21 see the nose is pretty good. If he fell down and he 
22 got the injuries to the body, they should be more 
23 prominent on the nose and on both sides of the 
24 forehead, not just on one side of the forehead. 
25 And I don't know, these look like

1 superficial scrape marks. They can happen 
2 sometimes, I don't even know if after the body is on 
3 the floor and people in the course of removing the 
4 body to the body bags, pull the body because the 
5 person pulling the legs is stronger than the person 
6 holding the head, they can cause some scraping 
7 damage, but this is more than usual so I'm not sure 
8 why. 
9 You prescribed linear and/or 
10 scraping a relative motion between his face and 
11 whatever object he scraped against. If he had his 
12 head down and in a charging motion, meaning he had a 
13 motion toward the officer, when he fell with his 
14 final shots, could that have caused, I mean, that 
15 type of abrasion. 
16 A Yeah, but then it would be most prominent 
17 on the nose. 
18 
19 A 
What if his head was turned? 
Also, there would be the object, the sand 
20 or dirt would be incorporated in it. This looks 
21 like a very clean, this is before he was washed and 
22 this looks all very clean. The blood is still dried 
23 here so. 
24 Q (By Ms. Whirley) I think the juror said 
25 what if his head was turned like on that side, what

1 if it was turned toward the right side? 
2 Head down and turned? 
3 A It's possible, I've not seen this 
4 extensive from that, but I don't know what the 
5 composition of the ground is either, so that's 
6 possible. 
7 If he would have fallen 
8 square on his face, you would expect to see 
9 something on the nose? 
10 If there wasn't damage to 
11 the nose, that applies he didn't land on his nose 
12 first, he had to land on one side or the other? 
13 A If it was caused by his landing, yes. 
14 August 9th was a very, very, 
15 very hot day here. So could it possibly be the 
16 ground was hot and from the impact of the fall? 
17 A It's possible, it's possible. But it 
18 would require movement. Just lying there on the 
19 ground wouldn't cause the scraping abrasions, it's 
20 possible, it's possible. 
21 
22 
23 
A 
MS. WHIRLEY: We have another question? 
It is kind of prominent for that. 
I'm going to go back with 
24 what you said if he would have fallen. Michael is a 
25 very big guy.

A Yes. 1 
2 We do know that he fell, 
3 with this impact, we know that he fell face forward. 
4 A Right. 
5 My understanding of his 
6 question is if he fell face forward, wouldn't there 
7 be something on his nose, disregarding these, 
8 wouldn't there be something on his nose that 
9 indicated he fell face forward? 
10 A Yes, but then he added on the question 
11 what if it was just on his right side. 
12 If he fell face forward, 
13 straight on, there would be something on his nose? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
A 
Yes, yes. 
Some sort of an abrasion? 
Yes. 
17 So if he had his head down 
18 and his head turned, that would lead us to a 
19 conclusion that the abrasions would be on the side 
20 of his face instead of the nose?

22 
23 
24 
A 
A 
Right, yes. 
Which is where these are? 
On the right side, yes.

25 turned your head to the other side.

1 I don't know my right from 
2 my left. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Because the injury is to 
4 the right side of his face. 
5 Right. 
6 A Yeah, if he fell on his right side and he 
7 moved forward you get certain abrasions. He also 
8 has cuts here, some of these are not just scrapes, 
9 but they're lacerations. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: They don't come from the 
11 gunshot wounds? 
12 A No, they don't come from the gunshot 
13 wound. the gunshot wound goes deeper and through the 
14 eye. If they came from the gunshot wound, the 
15 gunshot wound would be more to the outside. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Even if it was grazing? 
17 A This one is going into underlying soft 
18 tissue, so that it is underneath this. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I understand. 19 
20 A It is underneath the skin there and in 
21 order to graze you have to be on top of the skin. 
22 And this one went deep enough to go through the 
23 eyeball and come out down here. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. You don't know what 
25 to make up of it then?

I'm not sure why. I think the thing that 
2 puzzles me is the combination of factors. That some 
3 of it could be by scraping somehow, but not all of 
4 it. And if this were say a blow to the face causing 
5 laceration, it normally wouldn't cause a scraping 
6 wound. So it is some complex reason. 
7 Doctor, the top could be a 
8 small fragment, bone fragment that could do that? 
9 A Bone fragments can protrude through the 
10 skin, but in this instance it didn't, the bone 
11 fragments were largely the lower portion of the 
12 orbit and there was no bone fragments that were 
13 protruding. And that's the value of what the police 
14 did is that they took these photographs before any 
15 changes were made by the autopsy or by the 
16 embalming. And I think that's an interesting point, 
17 the bone fragments. I don't think it was caused by 
18 bone fragment, the fragmentation was lower down.
