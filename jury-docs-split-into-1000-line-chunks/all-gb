Yes. 
And so if you are sitting outside your

1 little loop around Canfield Drive, correct? 
A That's correct. 2 
3 Q But, for example, where this white car is 
4 in the map on the picture, which wasn't there that 
5 day, this image was not taken that day, but, for 
6 example, you wouldn't be able to see that far from 
7 where you were; is that right? 
A No. 8 
9 Q So what did you see that drew your 
10 attention? 
11 A Well, there were two guys walking down the 
12 street in the middle of street and, uh, police car 
13 passed them, it stopped where they were and they had 
14 conversation or whatever, and so they continued 
15 walking and then the police car backed up to where 
16 they were and I guess had another conversation that 
17 led to an altercation. 
18 After they had an altercation, one of 
19 the guys ran off and the other guy was still there, 
20 and then once he ran from the car, I seen the 
21 officer get out of his car and shoot in his 
22 direction, but that's all I seen. 
23 Q Okay. So use the laser pointer and show 
24 us where the two boys were when you first saw them

19 see any other car, other people down there? 
20 A Urn, like initially when the police truck

22 started coming through, I remember seeing a white 
23 car because the second guy, when the first shot was 
24 fired, he ran and got behind the car. The

6 the truck and fire more shots.

10 starts. 
11 Q Okay. Now, at this point do you see a

13 A Yes.

16 you can see his full body?
