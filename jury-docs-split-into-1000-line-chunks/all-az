If you are running, you 
11 continue running when the police say I shoot? 
12 A We wasn't running at the time, we was just 
13 standing there. If we had been running he said I'll 
14 shoot, oh, yeah, I'll stop. I don't want to get 
15 shot. We are standing still and someone draws a gun 
16 on you. 
17 What did he say the 
18 second time, I shoot? 
19 A Second time was not running, we was still 
20 standing at the car. He said it first, he said I'll 
21 shoot, and when he said it the first time, he's just 
22 aiming at us, he's not, you know, out of his car, we 
23 are still standing right there. The second time he 
24 begins to say it, but he doesn't even finish it when 
25 the gun goes off, when his gun goes off.

7 A It was a very serious incident that 
8 happened. I know that it just wasn't the robbery 
9 going to be brought up, someone died, someone lost 
10 their life. Of course you want somebody 
11 representing you that is going to make you look like 
12 your story isn't told from a point of view that 
13 people pick away at your words or go off of what you 
14 said, your dialogue. 
15 I would love to have a representative 
16 on the side of me that he takes my story and says it 
17 in a way that you'll understand it in dialogue that 
18 you will understand. 
19 I'm 22, I don't know how old you are, 
20 there is some things I could say, you know, you 
21 don't really understand and that's why I would have

7 one shot while he was inside the vehicle?

A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And his gun was still 
10 inside the vehicle? 
11 
12 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And no part of Mike Brown's 
13 body at that point was inside the vehicle? 
14 
15 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And that's the only shot 
16 you heard at the car, correct, the only shot that 
17 was fired at the car? 
18 
19 
A Correct, yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And then as Mike Brown ran 
20 away, the officer once he is going toward Mike 
21 Brown, he fired one shot? 
22 A Yes, ma'am. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: And you believe that that 
24 hit Mike Brown at that point?

1 MS. ALIZADEH: While Mike Brown is running 
2 away? 
3 A Yes. His back is facing me and the 
4 officer, Big Mike is ahead of us now. So he's the 
5 farthest one, the officer is behind him and I'm 
6 behind the officer, but basically Big Mike's back is 
7 facing both of us. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, Mike is running, I 
9 guess, at this point, right?

11 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Can you just stand up for 
12 me and show me what position Mike's body was in when 
13 you believe the officer shot him? 
14 
15 
A The second time? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yes, from behind as he was 
16 running away. 
17 A As he's running away, he's running with 
18 his arms down. Once the second shot fired off, I 
19 see his body do like a jerking movement, not to 
20 where it looked like he got hit in his back, but I 
21 knew, it maybe could have grazed him, but he 
22 definitely made a jerking movement. He didn't take 
23 a step after that, his next steps was turn around 
24 after the second shot. 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So when he made that

2 been hit by a bullet? 
3 A The second time. He was already struck 
4 the first time for sure with my eyes I saw blood 
5 come from his shirt. 
6 Q Right. I'm talking about when you say you 
7 saw him do kind of a jerk? 
8 A That would have been the second time he 
9 was hit. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. When you say you saw 
11 that happen, at that point his arms are not up, 
12 raised up, correct?

1 still angry because I know he could feel the shot. 
2 He could feel the first shot if he was only shot one 
3 time at that time, he definitely could feel that 
4 shot. Shot him right in the area because his hand 
5 couldn't really get up there. He was saying, I 
6 don't have a gun, pop, pop, pop, pop, all the shots 
7 came then. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So from the time he turned 
9 around, he did not proceed towards the officer?

A No, ma'am.

12 step and then he went down? 
13 A Half a step maybe, his foot was coming off 
14 the ground. He was being riddled with more shots 
15 and then caused him to tumble over. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you this. From 
17 the time you think he might have been shot when you 
18 saw the jerk, did he proceed to run any distance 
19 after that?

Away from the officer? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah. 
No, after the second shot was fired, that 
5 literally stopped him in his tracks and turned 
6 around at that point. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Then when you saw him turn 
8 around, is it possible that he ran, not ran, at that 
9 point he stopped running, right? 
10 
11 
A Right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Is it possible that he 
12 moved maybe 20, 22 feet toward the officer before he 
13 fell? 
14 A Not 20 to 22, not that far. Like I said, 
15 he was barely on the sidewalk, he was barely on the 
16 sidewalk to the parking lot. He was going towards 
17 this building. I presume that's the way he was 
18 running. He wasn't really all the way on the 
19 driveway when the second shot went off, and he 
20 turned around, and he was in the street. 
21 He was taking a step towards the 
22 officer to show him that he didn't have anything, 
23 his hand was up, so he is showing the officer, I 
24 don't have a weapon on me. 
25 And as he's walking toward the

1 officer saying that in an angry manner, he was 
2 saying it an angry manner, he was hurt, still 
3 frustrated probably, so he's telling him, I don't 
4 have a gun. I don't have before he can say, you 
5 know, anything else, this man is riddled with more 
6 shots until he tumbled other. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: He doesn't like run at the 
8 officer? 
9 A No, ma'am. At no point in time when he 
10 turned around he made a rush towards the officer or 
11 anything like he was going to tackle the officer or 
12 anything like that. He was standing straight up. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: He maybe got like a step 
14 you said before the gunshots? 
15 A Before the several shots came. That was 
16 the only time it came repeatedly, boom, boom, boom, 
17 boom, boom, and he went down and that was it. He 
18 wasn't moving any more. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: I don't know who was first. 
20 When the 
21 second shot was fired by Darren Wilson, where was he 
22 related to his patrol car, was he right next to his 
23 patrol car?

1 A Oh, no. The second shot, like I said, 
2 once he got fully out of the patrol car, he never 
3 turned back to it or got back in it. He came away 
4 from the patrol car and like I said, feet and 
5 distances are rough to me right now. 
6 I definitely know that his patrol car 
7 was in front of this driveway and in front of this 
8 building, and when he shot the second shot he was at 
9 the end of the building. 
10 That being said, 
11 going the same direction, they 
12 found two bullet casings near the car. Do you have 
13 any idea, any speculation why they find two bullet 
14 casings at the car when you only heard one shot. 
15 A I honestly do not know. He definitely 
16 only shot one time inside the car, it wasn't 
17 multiple shots. If they found, I mean, we don't 
18 have forensics both shells match his gun. If they 
19 did, I was lost after the first shot. That just 
20 shows how much more shock I was in because I 
21 definitely know he shot once, I wasn't aware of a 
22 second shot at the car.

2 where the wounds are, my thought was from the 
3 turning, you were demonstrating the turning, I just 
4 want to make sure. I don't know if you want to show 
5 us, you are saying he is walking like this, you are 
6 saying that second shot came on this side and then 
7 that he turned? 
8 A Yes. 
9 And the rest were on this 
10 side? 
11 A Well, he was running away, I didn't see 
12 where the bullet struck him. 
13 Okay. 
14 A That's why I was trying to go back, but I 
15 definitely saw the officer fire his gun while his 
16 back was towards us, and both me and the officer, I 
17 saw his body jerk. If he was struck, I don't know 
18 if he was fully struck or he just grazed him, but 
19 that's what stopped him in his tracks from running 
20 away from the second shot.

1 in the street between the patrol car and where Big 
2 Mike was laying in the street? 
3 A Oh, yes, there was people crossing, no one 
4 actually got close to his body, but people were 
5 walking through the street, back and forth across 
6 the side. 
7 They would get on the sidewalk as 
8 close they wanted to, but they wouldn't get in the 
9 street by the body. They got pretty close to get 
10 some real crazy pictures of his body. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Was there anything stopping 
12 them from getting up to his body before when it 
13 first happened because you said there were no police 
14 cars there initially? 
15 A Nothing stopped anybody from the public 
16 coming up to the dead body and just looking at it. 
17 It was uncovered, his body was not covered at the 
18 time, there was no police officers out there, 
19 nobody, just the squad car. And he was not there, 
20 there was no yellow tape. So people were just 
21 coming out their doors, kids, you know, there is a 
22 lot of kids out. 
23 Just looking at the dead body, like 
24 he is right here laying in front of us, that's how

7 to it like it is a prank or something like that. 
8 No, this is a real dead person, he's 
9 not covered, his pants down are by his knees, you 
10 could see the blood spilling from his top part, not

12 leaking because it is all coming from the top part.

1 actually, there was only one that they spewed to the 
2 public. It was the private autopsy where it said he 
3 got shot in his face. It came out and went back in,

20 well, yeah, I talked to somebody who told me this. 
21 
22 
A Right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: But people who actually saw 
23 this. Are you aware of anyone who claims that they 
24 saw any part of this who has not talked to the 
25 police or the FBI?

1 A I'm frankly surprised they have so many 
2 witnesses to the actual event, prior to it happened, 
3 I only saw one person that was out there when the 
4 first shot went off all the way up to the last shot, 
5 I only saw one person. I wasn't aware of anybody 
6 and I only saw her because before the initial first 
7 shot when the police stopped us, she was on her 
8 balcony and I just happen to glance up and see her 
9 and she stood there.

13 anybody who has said to you, man, that wasn't right, 
14 I saw the whole thing. I'm not getting involved. 
15 Is there anybody that you know of who claims to have 
16 seen it, but is not going to come forward on their 
17 own? 
18 A Since the day all of this, of everything 
19 that happened, I haven't spoken to anyone in 
20 Canfield, per se. They really, I haven't seen, I 
21 haven't been in that area. 
22 It was a hard time for me getting my 
23 things out of my apartment complex, so that's what 
24 I'm dealing with now actually because they don't 
25 want me consulting with nobody who may have heard

1 something from somebody else that want to tell me 
2 something and stuff like that, I really don't know. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: The reason I ask you is 
4 that at some point, I want to make sure that we've 
5 heard, I don't want somebody coming forward down the 
6 road and saying, hey, they never contacted me. 
7 A Right. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: You know, if you know 
9 somebody or later learn of somebody, would you let 
10 us know so that we can try to talk to them? 
11 A I pray that they get resolved before then, 
12 but if someone ever came to me with evidence that 
13 they was there and seeing something that is not 
14 brought up already, then I would definitely relay 
15 them to you all. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Just also to clarify 
17 because earlier you said you kind of knew some 
18 neighbors and stuff, and you saw on the 
19 balcony. Did you know her name before all of this 
20 happen. 
21 A I met her as She had recently just 
22 moved there. I saw her moving in. I offered to 
23 help them. I saw it was just two girls, I offered 
24 to help them. She told me her name, she told me it 
25 was I later found out her full name.

Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is there anything you want 
5 to tell us that we just didn't think to ask that you 
6 think is important, is information about this case? 
7 A Yes. Regardless of everybody's opinion of 
8 me, I know a lot of speculation of my past and 
9 criminal record that I have or anything like that, 
10 that day I felt like even though the store thing had 
11 happened, I didn't feel like someone should have 
12 lost their life. 
13 I feel like the incident at the car 
14 with both Mike Brown and Officer Darren Wilson could 
15 have been resolved without deadly force. 
16 We definitely wasn't posing a threat 
17 to his life. I just want, I just pray that 
18 everybody sees the evidence for what it really is. 
19 Deadly force was really not necessary, everything 
20 else, had he knew about the store incident, him 
21 stopping us, all of that that's protocol, I get 
22 that. Deadly force was never ever needed and I pray 
23 that people really see that we didn't have any 
24 weapons on us or anything like that. 
25 He could be in jail right now.

1 MS. WHIRLEY: You mentioned something, you 
2 know, the grand jurors may want to factor. You said 
3 something about a criminal record? 
4 A Yes, because I stay watching the news and 
5 media outlets. I see they dug through years in my 
6 past to see an incident that happened in Jefferson 
7 City, but what they fail, they keep leaving out is I 
8 was a freshman in college at this time, everybody 
9 makes, you know, crazy little moves their freshman 
10 year. I was just beginning, I was getting out, I 
11 was breaking out of my kid years, you know, just 
12 being on my own around new people, Atlanta people, 
13 Washington people, people I never see on a daily 
14 basis, I'm from St. Louis. 
15 So to hold that against me and 
16 Michael Brown on a day that has nothing to do with 
17 it, I feel like it is very wrong, especially for 
18 them not to dig two or three years prior and in 
19 Darren Wilson's file and see if any complaints were 
20 made against him. Basically all I keep seeing is 
21 slander on my name. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) We don't want to slander 
23 you, but we just want all the information you can 
24 get. What is the nature of the thing in Jefferson 
25 City, what happened?

1 A There was just basically me walking with a 
2 group of kids that I knew, we were going to a YMCA 
3 to play basketball. I didn't have membership there. 
4 They actually had membership there. So we are 
5 walking through some apartments, one of the guys, 
6 you know, he grabbed a package and, you know, he 
7 ripped it opened. As we are walking towards the 
8 YMCA, I see a pool guy, he sees us, but he doesn't 
9 see anything in our hand or anything like that, but 
10 he sees us walking from out of the apartments going 
11 towards the gym. 
12 So I guess whoever's package it was, 
13 they made the call saying someone had stole 
14 something off their property or something like that. 
15 And I guess he took it in his own 
16 mind that I just saw these guys coming out of those 
17 apartments. When they went to run the YMCA cameras 
18 to see who had just recently walked in, I did not 
19 pay to get in, even though I was supposed to. I 
20 kind of just walked right on past, go down to the 
21 gym, play basketball. 
22 And when the police came and they ran 
23 the camera back and they saw like he didn't pay or 
24 this group right here, they came down, they grabbed 
25 basically the last group.

MS. WHIRLEY: Did you get charged with 
I did not get charged with it, I had to go 
4 to court on two charges. 
5 
6 A 
MS. WHIRLEY: What were the charges? 
I had a false report to an officer, I had 
7 stealing charge that they were trying to see if I 
8 was the one that had stole it. I was going to 
9 court. At that time of me leaving court, I had been 
10 fed up with being stopped by off campus police and 
11 on campus police because of the stereotypical they 
12 look at people from St. Louis. And being stopped 
13 everyday, being late for class and having to remake 
14 up work, I just said you know what, Jefferson City 
15 school, Lincoln University was not for me at the 
16 time. 
17 So I left, and still having to come 
18 back to court in Jefferson City, I've been getting a 
19 lot done down here in St. Louis. I don't have a 
20 charge for the City or County of St. Louis, but when 
21 they run my name, they see Jefferson City. They 
22 detain me sometimes, some police officers let me go. 
23 A couple police officers they detain me. Jefferson 
24 City, they never come and get me. The warrant is a 
25 500 mile, my lawyer reached out to them, if you are

4 I'm sure the other police officers they see that, 
5 but they always detain me and they hold me. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: You were never on probation 
7 for that? 
8 A When I got locked up, when I had got 
9 locked up, I got to the Jefferson City probation 
10 about the stealing, I guess I was in the middle of 
11 asking the judge can I do my probation in St. Louis 
12 because I was not from Jefferson City and in the 
13 middle of that we kind of lost contact, lost 
14 communication.

1 mentioned the stealing thing and then you said a 
2 false police report? 
3 A Yes. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Is that the same incident 
5 or was that a separate thing? 
6 A That was the same incident with the 
7 officer who actually had me, he put me in the car, 
8 took me down to the station. I had both my school 
9 campus ID and my state ID in possession of me. When 
10 the officer asked me my name, I didn't say anything 
11 so much as just handed him my identification. I was 
12 mad at the time, again, I was a freshman in college, 
13 I'm kind of angry with the police, so I don't really 
14 want to say anything to them, but I know what he is 
15 going to ask me for my identification. 
16 So I hand him my school ID and both 
17 my state ID at the same time. He is looking at both 
18 of them, he's looking at me. I have a very 
19 distinguished feature about me, I have one of my 
20 eyes, I have a cataract, one of them is blue and the 
21 other one is brown. It is like that on both my 
22 picture ID, I have distinguish color on my eyes. 
23 So I'm sure he can see that, in my 
24 mind I know he can see it, I know he can tell that 
25 this is me, who I am. He actually called campus

1 security from Lincoln University, they also came 
2 down and verified that's him, you know, we seem him 
3 walking around on campus. But because I never said 
4 nothing to the officer, he took that as 
5 disobedience. 
6 And he was like, you are not going to 
7 tell me anything, so I'm just going to write down 
8 that you gave me a false report. Me being a 
9 freshman and not really wanting to talk to him, I 
10 just kind of shrug my shoulders not thinking too 
11 much of it until it got to court and it was like 
12 this is serious, but the judge, he threw that one 
13 out of court. I never got charged for that or 
14 anything.
