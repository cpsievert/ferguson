GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XV 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is Thursday, 
Page 5 
5 October 23rd at 9:06 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh, 
6 Sheila Whirley is also present, all 12 grand jurors 
7 are present as well as , the court reporter, 
8 and we need to take up a few matters before we begin 
9 with witnesses today. 
10 Urn, I would imagine all of you, I mean, 
11 most of you, if not all of you, have been aware that 
12 there have been media reports out there that seem to 
13 indicate that there are leaks in the investigation 
14 and that reports have been leaked and testimony has 
15 been leaked and so forth. 
16 And first off, as I've said from the very 
17 beginning, you all have to be guided by what occurs 
18 in this room. We all know sometimes the media 
19 doesn't get things right, but you know, if you do 
20 read those things, you need to make sure you take 
21 that with a grain of salt. You all have heard all 
22 the evidence together, so you know what you have 
23 heard and seen. 
24 But I do want to say, and Sheila and I 
25 have had a conference, we've had a conference with

1 Mr. McCulloch, we've had conferences with a lot of 
2 others, with the County Police Department and 
3 everything, and I can assure you that we know that 
4 the leak, that the leaks are not coming from the 
5 grand jury. There is no doubt in our minds that 
6 none of you are the source of that. 
7 And to tell you the truth, one of the 
8 reasons that I know that is the medical examiner's 
9 report is out there and I've looked at what's out 
10 there, what was leaked by the Post-Dispatch, it was 
11 put out there by the Post-Dispatch and I can tell 
12 you it is not the copy that you have. It is the 
13 medical examiner's report, but every medical 
14 examiner's report that we get has a stamp on it. It 
15 says not for secondary release. 
16 And the report that is out there that was 
17 published by the Post-Dispatch does have that stamp 
18 on there, but it is not the same stamp that I have, 
19 and I know it is not the same stamp that is on your 
20 copy. 
21 So it says the same thing, but their's is 
22 in a straight line and it is different looking than 
23 our stamp, the stamp that we have on our copies. 
24 And the same thing with the County Police, 
25 it is different than the stamp that they have from

1 their copies. 
2 So wherever this came from, it did not 
3 come from our office, it did not come from you guys. 
4 You don't have a copy that looks like that, it did 
5 not come from the County Police. 
6 And the other reason why we're fairly, not 
7 fairly, we're 100 percent confident that this is not 
8 coming from the grand jurors or from the County 
9 Police is that in the very beginning when there was 
10 a supposed leak, this was a story that was broken by 
11 the New York Times, but it was their Washington 
12 Bureau that published the story and they cited their 
13 source as a government official who had been briefed 
14 on the civil rights investigation. 
15 We are sharing our information with the 
16 federal government because they are conducting their 
17 own independent investigation and so they have all 
18 the same reports and the same things that we have. 
19 And so we are confident that the leak is 
20 someone in probably the Department of Justice and is 
21 not coming from St. Louis County Police, not from 
22 our office, and not from this grand jury. 
23 I know you all maybe were concerned about 
24 that, but we are 100 percent confident that we're 
25 all good.

leave so that being said, 
to know that we still have 
in the grand jury and the 
we know that you're going 
going to be guided by the 
heard during your 
I 
to do 
10 So that's the first thing. Anything else 
11 that we discussed that needs to be said? 
12 The other thing that we have talked about 
13 at the very beginning of this process we kind of had 
14 set a goal for ourselves that we were going to try 
15 to complete this by mid November. 
16 If you recall that was originally the idea 
17 that we could extend the grand jury or that it could 
18 be a six month term and that would put you at like 
19 mid November. It was then again extended to 
20 January, that was done just out of an abundance of 
21 caution in case we didn't get done by mid November. 
22 We still would like to finish by mid 
23 November. I can tell you that the light is at the 
24 end of the tunnel so to speak. We have discussed 
25 what we have left to put on and I will tell you

1 there are approximately 15 eyewitnesses or lay 
2 witnesses who we believe would have valuable 
3 testimony to give. However, I will tell you that I 
4 don't know, we are making our best efforts to get 
5 everyone in, but I can tell you that you some of 
6 these witnesses are resisting. 
7 Some of them have frankly said there is no 
8 way I'm coming in, no way I'm going to testify. 
9 We're trying to get witnesses under subpoena, but if 
10 you knock on the door and nobody answers, we have no 
11 right to, you know, kick in the door and serve them 
12 with a subpoena. 
13 We can only do so much. So even though we 
14 have potentially 15 lay witnesses that we may still 
15 call, I expect we are not going to be able to call 
16 all of those witnesses. We are going to do our 
17 best. 
18 But in the event that we want to wrap this 
19 up, if we try our best to wrap this up in mid 
20 November, we talked about possibly going to again a 
21 three day a week schedule. That would, you know, 
22 again, we're trying to get this completed and by all 
23 means, there is no deadline so you all don't feel 
24 that you have the time, there is no magic date, 
25 there is no reason this hasn't to be done on a

1 certain date. 
2 With that in mind, if you can talk during 
3 your lunch break today about your November schedule 
4 because we don't have any dates yet for November and 
5 think about including an additional day. 
6 I know you've been very generous to give 
7 us two days a week, and keep in mind as well that 
8 from the very beginning we've said if you all need 
9 to meet in the evening or Saturday or Sunday, even 
10 if it is a half day on Saturday or Sunday, we will 
11 be there, we will do it. 
12 The other thing that we talked about is 
13 that there was a question early on about possibly 
14 getting the police vehicle for you all to see for 
15 yourself, which I've already investigated that and 
16 we can't. 
17 It's been repaired, so it has a window in 
18 it now and I haven't seen it myself whether or not 
19 the demarcation where the bullet hole was, I don't 
20 know if that's still there. But I know that you are 
21 interested in how big the vehicle is, how tall it 
22 is, what it might be like to stand next to it and so 
23 forth. 
24 We can have that done a number of ways.

1 bring that here and made available for you in the 
2 parking garage for you all to get in, examine, get 
3 around. However, if we do it here, it would be wise 
4 not to do it during business hours, because there's 
5 really no place in the parking garage where we can 
6 do this where people won't see you up and around a 
7 Ferguson Police car. 
8 We have construction workers in the 
9 parking garage, there are county employees, we have 
10 just members of the public that can park in the 
11 parking garage. 
12 If you would like to see the vehicle here 
13 in this location, I would suggest that maybe if we 
14 do that on an evening or weekend where nobody will 
15 be down here, no construction workers, very few 
16 county employees. 
17 The other possibility is that we could 
18 bring the vehicle to the St. Louis County Police 
19 Academy, which is in Wellston, it is maybe a 15 
20 minute drive from here. We put you all in a van and 
21 take you out there. 
22 They've got a secure garage and you could 
23 exit there. If you recall Detective talked 
24 about it, they had towed it to their garage which is 
25 a secure facility here in Clayton.

1 investigate whether or not that garage might be 
2 available. 
3 The problem with that is, it contains 
4 other evidence, there might be things in there the 
5 County Police may say, yeah, we can't let these 
6 people in here, we have other evidence in other 
7 cases and it would be compromised, the integrity of 
8 other investigations. So, plus I'm not 100 percent 
9 sure that that garage is even still there. 
10 They're in the process of demolishing 
11 buildings, that might not even be available, but 
12 those are a couple options bringing it here and
