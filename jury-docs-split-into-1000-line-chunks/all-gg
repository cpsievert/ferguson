16 we can actually get a better picture of that. 
17 Perhaps, okay, a little bit better here. 
18 So we actually call this a 
19 superficial incised wound. In our opinion, a sharp 
20 force injury, it is not blunt. 
21 Whatever caused this was something 
22 sharp, like a piece of glass, a piece of jagged 
23 metal, a knife, something like that, something 
24 sharp. The way that we can tell that is the edges 
25 of this are very clean. We don't see any abrasion

1 along it. 
2 I think what you see here that is 
3 kind of dark along the edge of this is actually some 
4 vital reaction, he is getting a little inflammation 
5 from it. It doesn't take long for a wound to become 
6 inflamed. I think that is what we are seeing here. 
7 And again, it is a little dry, it is 
8 eight days later, he has been embalmed, so it is a 
9 little different than it would look during the first 
10 autopsy. 
11 And then along the same trajectory 
12 right here, you can pick up kind of a faint scratch 
13 along with it. So again, this is consistent, in our 
14 opinion, with something sharp. 
15 Q All right. So in your opinion, you have 
16 said a couple of times in our opinion. 
17 So are you performing the autopsy 
18 
19 
together with Dr. ? 
A That is correct. We performed this 
20 autopsy together. 
21 Q And do you talk about your beliefs and 
22 findings as you are performing the autopsy? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes. 
Who prepared the report in this case?

1 proofread it and signed it. 
2 Q All right. And so when you say our 
3 opinion, for purposes of this grand jury I 
4 understand that it is because you and Dr. 
5 were working together, but it is important that we 
6 make sure that we are getting your opinion.

10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Since Dr. is not here to testify. 
Yes. 
And let me just ask you, was there ever 
11 any difference of opinion between you and 
12 Dr. in your autopsy and your findings in 
13 this case? 
14 A There was not. 
15 Q Okay. All right. So if you continue to 
16 say our opinion, it is also your opinion as well. 
17 A That is correct. I can change and say my 
18 opinion. 
19 Q Okay. So now in this wound you said you 
20 think this was caused by a sharp object? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
23 a bullet? 
24 A 
I do. 
You don't think that that could have been 
I do not. This does not look like a graze 
25 gunshot wound to me. Again, I know we use the word

1 clean, I know that is kind of subjective. It is a 
2 little hard to fine, but when I say clean, I mean 
3 the edges of this are very straight, there is not a 
4 lot of abrasion to it. 
5 A gunshot wound is going to create a 
6 lot of abrasion, it's going to look for all intents 
7 and purposes a lot slopier, it is not going to look 
8 like that. 
9 Q And to kind of jump ahead a little bit 
10 here. After your autopsy, did you have a chance to 
review Dr. report? 
A I did once we completed our autopsy. We 
11 
12 
13 actually sat down with Dr. , Dr. 
14 Dr. and our photographer at a table and we 
15 reviewed all the images from the first autopsy. It 
16 was at that point he also gave us his autopsy 
17 report, which may have been preliminary at that 
18 time, but actually I think it was finalized. 
19 
20 Dr. 
Q Regarding this particular wound, you and 
disagree about what might have caused 
21 that wound; is that correct? 
22 A Correct. Dr. , he may have called 
23 this abrasion. In my opinion an abrasion is 
24 superficial. It's basically the very most outer 
25 layer of the skin is just kind of worn away and it

1 is a blunt force injury. It is either your body 
2 impact a blunt object like a baseball bat or 
3 something flat or blunt object impact your body. 
4 That is what an abrasion is, it is very superficial. 
5 This is deeper, it goes through the 
6 outer layers of skin. You can actually start to see 
7 a little bit of the deeper dermis and the 
8 subcutaneous tissue within that wound. 
9 The only other thing that would be on 
10 differential for this is a laceration, which is also 
11 a blunt force injury. We see them all the time in 
12 contact sports, people that get hit in boxing, they 
13 get lacerations, the skin rips. 
14 Again, I think this is a sharp force 
15 injury, a superficial incised wound. 
16 Q Now, let me ask you then, Dr. in 
17 your experience as a pathologist for the military, I 
18 would imagine you have seen performed a number of 
19 autopsies on servicemen who were killed by IUD's? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
22 forth? 
23 A 
24 Q 
Correct. 
And they have like shrapnel injures and so 
Correct. 
A shrapnel injury, would that be something 
25 like you would have a piece of metal or some other

Page 95 
1 hard object that would injure the skin or injure the 
2 tissue? 
3 A Correct, it can injure the body in a great 
4 number of ways. If you want to call shrapnel 
5 injuries, we would call them blast fragment 
6 injuries. They can actually look like gunshot 
7 wounds, but depending on the velocity and size of 
8 the fragment, it can also cause lacerations. I 
9 would not call them sharp force injuries if they 
10 impacted the body. 
11 Q Okay. So you don't think the bullet 
12 grazing the surface of skin could cause that injury? 
13 
14

17 
that 
A 
Q 
Dr. 
A 
Q 
That is 
Okay. 
I did. 
And I'm 
not my opinion. 
Did you look at the photographs 
has taken of this injury? 
just wondering because we've 
18 talked earlier and Dr. has testified, of 
19 course, before about that experts can differ in 
20 their opinions. Did anything about the photographs 
21 that Dr. had taken change your opinion 
22 about the cause of what caused this injury? 
23 A No, in fact, his photographs reinforced 
24 what I thought. I still believe this is a sharp 
25 force injury with his photographs and in addition to

1 ours. 
2 Q Did you discuss with Dr. that you 
3 had a difference of opinion in regard to this 
4 injury? 
5 A We had talked about it, yes. But he 
6 wasn't swayed one way or another. 
7 Q And you weren't swayed either to change 
8 your opinion? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No. 
All right. And so could a piece of glass 
11 could have caused this injury, yes. I believe a 
12 piece of glass could have caused that injury? 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: The only question I have is 
14 that this injury you believe happen 
15 contemporaneously with the gunshot injury? 
16 A I do, especially if you look at the first, 
17 the first autopsy images of this injury. It looks 
18 very acute, it doesn't have any signs of healing. 
19 It has a little bit of inflammation around the 
20 border, it is still wide open and it is bleeding. I 
21 would think that if that injury had occurred in the 
22 past it would have potentially have been treated in 
23 some way, a bandage or something, that is a pretty 
24 large wound to leave open.

1 is the back side of what side, left or right? 
A This is the left arm. 2 
3 This is the left arm? 
4 A Correct. It would be like right here. 
5 Oh, so it is right here. 
6 So could that have happened against a metal car 
7 rubbing up against the window? 
8 A I believe so, as long as whatever impacted 
9 his arm at that point was a sharp object, jagged 
10 metal, glass, yes. 
11 Okay. 
12 What a 
13 about fingernail? 
14 A Fingernail, no. Fingernail injury we 
15 would term abrasions. It would have to be an 
16 extraordinarily filed and sharp fingernail to cause 
17 that injury. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: You know, I appreciate as 
19 we move along, rather than save your questions just 
20 butt in because while we have a slide up, it makes 
21 sense for you to raise those questions for the 
22 doctor as we go along. 
23 So the next image, this image we have seen 
24 of the lower half of his body.

1 the left hand here. At this point you saw in the 
2 last image we flipped his body back over and I think 
3 what is becoming apparent here is a small abrasion 
4 here kind of at the base of the wrist. 
5 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So you describe this as 
6 an abrasion? 
7 A Correct. An abrasion meaning it is a 
8 blunt force injury, either the hand impacted a blunt 
9 object or the blunt object impacted the hand. And 
10 it eroded away some of the superficial layers of 
11 skin leaving that. 
12 Q Could that injury have been caused by a 
13 bullet? 
14 A No, it is not my opinion that could be 
15 caused by a bullet. 
16 Q 
17 abrasion? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
A 
You can't say what object then caused that 
I cannot. 
MS. WHIRLEY: A fingernail? 
Fingernail abrasions usually, we call them 
21 curve linear, they are basically a little U shaped 
22 abrasions. I don't think that that's a fingernail 
23 injury. 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. WHIRLEY: Someone grabbing, holding? 
Potentially, but again, I cannot look at 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson

1 that and tell you what caused it. 
2 
3 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
A bracelet? 
November 6, 20 14 
Page 99 
4 A A bracelet potentially, yeah, a bracelet 
5 could do it, that's one possibility. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Would the bracelet have to 
7 have been a hard object? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A It depends on how the injury occurred. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, all right. 
A I can't add any more to that. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask you this. We 
12 see a bracelet now on the right hand, was there an 
13 identifying bracelet on the left hand? 
14 A I don't recall there being one on the left 
15 hand, no. But I know that it is not a postmortem 
16 abrasion because we can see that same abrasion on 
17 the autopsy photographs in the first case and there 
18 wasn't that bracelet there yet. 
19 So in this image here now we can see 
20 entrance gunshot wound to the right forearm and that 
21 couples with the exit gunshot wound that we saw on 
22 the anterior surface of the right forearm in 
23 previous images. 
24 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And so this wound have 
25 been, entrance wound would have been on the other 
FAX 314-241-6750

Page 100 
1 side of his forearm, correct? 
2 A Correct. This is the entrance wound for 
3 this gunshot wound, and we saw the exit wound when 
4 he was laying on his stomach and that was on the 
5 right forearm in this location on the anterior 
6 surface. 
7 Q And I just lost what I was going to say. 
8 Looking at the x-rays of his extremities, were you 
9 able to tell if this gunshot wound impacted any 
10 bone? 
11 A Correct. The right ulna was fractured and 
12 we picked that up on x-ray. 
13 Q And was that fracture consistent with a 
14 bullet passing through his forearm? 
15 A It was 100 percent consistent with a 
16 bullet trajectory with an entrance wound here and an 
17 exit wound here, going through the right ulna. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Two things. One is this 
19 wound consistent with being, with him being shot 
20 from behind, you understand what I'm saying? If 
21 someone is pursuing him and shooting, is that wound 
22 consistent with receiving that shot in that way? 
23 A Right, obviously, a difficult question to 
24 answer because as you know, our arms can do all 
25 sorts of things in three dimensional space. And, 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XX November 6, 20 14 
Page 101 
1 you know, the shooter versus who is receiving the 
2 bullets, it also depends on where they are in three 
3 dimensional space. 
4 So if you are asking me could a shot 
5 from his backside produce that, I say yes. Because 
6 as you are running, if your arm is down like this, 
7 that surface, that very surface of your arm is 
8 exposed posteriorly. So a bullet coming from behind 
9 you could cause that injury. 
10 Could it come from the front side? 
11 Yes, depending on how your arm is. If your arm is 
12 out in front of you like this, a bullet impacting 
13 here could still exit here. 
14 If your arms are up like this, they 
15 have to be rotated in order for the bullet to impact 
16 here if the shooter is directly ahead of you. It's 
17 difficult, but I think there is a lot of different 
18 scenarios that can explain that trajectory. 
19 (indicating) 
20 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the last posture that 
21 you demonstrated with your arms above your head. 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
You said you believe your palms would have 
24 to be rotated? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct. 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XX November 6, 20 14 
Page 102 
1 Q So I can describe for the record, you had 
2 your palms facing each other? 
3 A Correct. If my palms face outward like 
4 this, that part of the arm is starting to go 
5 lateral. The shooter in my opinion if you are 
6 facing like this would have to be at that angle. In 
7 order to go through your arm here and exit here. It 
8 is kind of going leftward, right. If your arms are 
9 up like this. If you rotate in, then the bullet can 
10 come more face on. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: And that's assuming that the 
12 shooter is right in front of you? 
13 A That's correct. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: If the shooter is diagonal 
15 to you? 
16 A If the shooter is diagonal, right, then I 
17 believe your palms can be facing forward, but you 
18 are not directly whoever is shooting you at that 
19 point. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And this is the right arm, 
correct? 
A This is his right forearm. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So if the shooter were

2 A Just a close-up image of the entrance 
3 gunshot wound to the right forearm. Just some 
4 pertinent negatives that we see here, we don't see 
5 any close range discharge of a firearm, any evidence 
6 of that. 
7 When I say that, that means 
8 stippling, which is essentially impact with the skin 
9 with burning and unburned gunpowder particles. We 
10 don't see any soot, which is a product of combustion 
11 of the gunpowder, we don't see any deposition of 
12 that. 
13 I don't see any searing or muzzle 
14 imprint that would have occurred if a gun was right 
15 
16 
up against that forearm. So no evidence of that. 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And just to jump ahead a 
17 bit so you're not repetitious. We will talk about 
18 the hand injury separately, but other than the hand 
19 injury, were any of the other gunshot wounds in your 
20 opinion, did you observe any soot or stippling on 
21 any of those other injuries? 
22 A On none of the other injuries did we see 
23 any soot, stippling or unburned gunpowder particles. 
24 No evidence of close range discharge of a firearm on 
25 any of these gunshot wounds except for the one you

1 had just mentioned on the hand. 
2 And again, we have to preface that by 
3 saying I did not have the clothing to inspect at the 
4 time of this autopsy. And furthermore, this could 
5 have been the third autopsy, the body has been 
6 embalmed, washed several times. A lot of that stuff 
7 can start to wash away. Stippling doesn't, but soot 
8 can. 
9 And the other thing to say is the 
10 gunshot wound to the top of the head, Michael Brown 
11 had pretty thick hair. So a lot of times hair can 
12 actually prevent deposition of soot, stippling. 
13 Q Okay. Can you describe this injury, this 
14 wound? 
15 A This here is an entrance gunshot wound to 
16 the upper right arm. We saw the exit wound earlier 
17 that was closer to the armpit. So this entrance 
18 wound was here on the right lateral arm and the exit 
19 was under the arm here by the armpit area. 
20 And again, just a close-up image of 
21 the same.

Q 
A 
Next image? 
Okay. So we have two things we can talk 
24 about here. One is an entrance wound, gunshot

1 is a gunshot exit wound on the right chin. 
Q All right. 2 
3 A Again, close-up image here of the entrance 
4 gunshot wound to the right clavicle area. 
5 So here we have two things we can 
6 talk about. This is a graze wound, a graze gunshot 
7 wound on right forearm, excuse me, right upper arm, 
8 that's basically in the bicep area. That would be 
9 about here on my arm. 
10 This here is just another angle on 
11 that entrance gunshot wound to the upper right arm. 
12 (indicating) 
13 Q Can you tell anything from that graze 
14 injury that you are circling right now about the 
15 direction of travel of the bullet? 
16 A So we cannot, I cannot. We talked about 
17 earlier with that thumb wound, a lot of the ways 
18 that we can tell trajectory on some superficial like 
19 this is with the skin tags. Well, you guys can see 
20 just as well as I do there are no skin tags here. 
21 Sometimes we can start to guess by 
22 the direction of the abrasions. We don't really 
23 have anything that I can go on here to tell the 
24 trajectory of this fire. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
All right. And the next image?

1 A Just a close-up image of the same here. 
2 And some of what you are seeing here is drying 
3 artifact. Again, the body has been now deceased for 
4 a number of days and embalmed. It is starting to 
5 take on a more black color, which is not uncommon 
6 for these gunshot wounds. 
7 Q And the next, this image is just a more 
8 distant image of that grazing wound that you just 
9 spoke of? 
10 A Agreed, and then there's that entrance 
11 gunshot wound again on the upper right arm. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
All right. 
A picture here of his tattoos. Another 
14 shot here of the exit gunshot wound on the right 
15 side of the chin here and coming into the field here 
16 also are abrasions. Now, a little more dry 
17 appearing than what they were eight days prior. 
18 The exit wound 
19 you were speaking of, were you able to determine 
20 what entrance wound? 
21 A Coupled with that exit? 
22 Was it this one on the 
23 chest? 
24 A Oh, okay. So this is the exit wound for a 
25 gunshot wound that was on the forehead. And right

1 here on the right clavicle area was another entrance 
2 gunshot. So I guess we haven't talked about that. 
3 So the total amount of the gunshot 
4 wounds in this case is eight. There is eight 
5 separate gunshot wounds. 
6 Now, the possibility exist that the 
7 gunshot wound to the right clavicle and the gunshot 
8 right lateral chest could be reentry gunshot wounds. 
9 The gunshot wound to the arm or the gunshot wound to 
10 the forehead. It is my opinion that entrance wound 
11 here on the right clavicle is likely a reentry wound 
12 from that exit right there on right chin because the 
13 trajectories line up perfectly. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And then regarding the 
15 entrance wound on the chest being a reentry of a 
16 gunshot wound to the forearm, would that all just 
17 depend on how that forearm was positioned when the 
18 bullet passed through it? 
19 A Correct. This gunshot wound on the upper 
20 right arm, which we've seen and then the exit was 
21 here, under the axilla basically. I have a hard 
22 time with that one coming from my body and causing 
23 this entrance gunshot wound to the right lateral 
24 chest, which we actually have not seen a picture of 
25 yet. The trajectory doesn't make sense in my mind.

1 The arm would have to be pretty up 
2 and over across the chest in order to come back, 
3 because that's where they got the bullet. It 
4 entered here and recovered it down here on the right 
5 lower flank. It is challenging, but the forearm one

All right. And this is also that wound 
This is the exit wound on the jawline 
10 there on the right side of the face. 
11 Question, Dr. 
12 
13 
14 
A Yes. 
In order for a bullet to 
15 enter twice, go in, come out and enter, do you have 
16 to be close or far away for that to happen? 
17 A You do not, no. It is really going to 
18 depend on the type of weapon, the type of ammunition 
19 and what structures the bullet hits as it goes 
20 through the body. It's a very complicated question. 
21 But at this range, I'm actually not sure what weapon 
22 was used and I do not know the caliber. I can't 
23 really comment any further on that.

25 Q

Okay. Thank you.

1 injuries to the right eye and above the eye? 
2 A Correct. So now we can see the entrance 
3 wound that was on the forehead here. It is a little 
4 bit to the right of the midline. 
5 This gunshot wound actually caused 
6 these lacerations both here to the right eyebrow and 
7 to the upper right eyelid here as it passed 
8 underneath of it. It also ruptured the right eye. 
9 I didn't even see it at the time of our autopsy. It 
10 was essentially obliterated. 
11 It fractured several bones in the 
12 
13 
face and then it exited right here. (indicating) 
Q And that is a bullet that you said 
14 possibly could have then reentered the clavicle 
15 area? 
16 A Correct. So minimum number of gunshot 
17 wounds is six in this case and then eight total 
18 depending on whether or not you believe these are 
19 reentry wounds, you can drop the total number of 
20 gunshot wounds to six. Again, just a closer up 
21 image. 
22 Q Let me just clarify that. When you talk 
23 about gunshot wounds, if each wound is separate. 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Right. 
I think there is some confusion. We've

1 heard about other possible opinions. So how many 
2 total gunshots wound were on Michael Brown's body? 
3 A If you want to count entrance and exist 
4 separately? 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Right. 
See, I haven't been doing that. When I 
7 say eight total gunshots wounds, I just mean 
8 basically eight bullets went through his body. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
If you want to drop the number to six 
11 total bullets went through his body, you would have 
12 to consider this and these two injuries on the right 
13 chest as reentry wounds. 
14 Q Okay. I didn't want there to be some 
15 confusion that you thought there were only eight 
16 wounds on the body that were caused by a bullet. 
17 A No. 
18 Q Okay. All right. So the next slide we 
19 see is another image of the entry wound in the 
20 forehead; is that right? 
21 A That's correct. This is a closer up image 
22 of that. 
23 Q And again, you do not believe that this 
24 was a close contact wound? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I do not. There would have been,

1 obviously, in this situation no clothing over the 
2 body. He wasn't wearing a hat, his hair wasn't 
3 here, we see no stippling, no soot, no muzzle 
4 imprint, no searing of his skin, no evidence. 
5 Q This bullet would have traveled downward 
6 through the eye and then exited out the jaw? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And so given that Michael Brown was about 
9 6'5", the bullet would of had to have entered and 
10 traveled downward, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So the barrel of the gun would have to 
13 have been above, when I say above, it had to enter 
14 from this direction, correct? (indicating) 
15 A Correct. Again, it is difficult with 
16 trajectories. We have to imagine, there is a lot of 
17 different scenarios to explain this trajectory. 
18 Yes, if you just look at it in anatomic position, it 
19 goes sharply downward to the right and a little bit 
20 backward. I can manipulate my head in all sorts of 
21 ways in three dimensional space where the shooter, 
22 if we don't know where he is, there is a lot of 
23 different ways to get that wound. 
24 So we don't know anything 
25 whether or not he was falling or whether he bent

1 over to charge or whether he was just bending? 
2 A Correct, yeah. I can't tell you from this 
3 what he was doing, that's correct. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. The next slide. 
5 A Okay. So here they're just taking a more 
6 close-up image of the skin lacerations that were the 
7 result of that entrance gunshot wound. So again 
8 here, eyelid and eyebrow. 
9 Q But those were caused by the bullet 
10 passing through? 
A Correct. 
Q That's not like a blunt force? 
11 
12 
13 A We don't have any reason to suspect these 
14 are separate injuries. We believe, I believe that 
15 they were caused by that single gunshot wound to the 
16 forehead. 
17 Q Okay. Next one? 
18 A So left hand, we just noticed a few 
19 defects here, some small abrasions. Dr. 
20 also mentioned some possible abrasions, I think he 
21 calls them postmortem at times. Bottom line, I 
22 wouldn't make a big deal of these abrasions. They 
23 could have been there before. 
24 I have a question going 
25 back to the one in the head. I just want to make

1 sure that I understand. Would it have been 
2 possible, from what I'm reading, you're not 
3 indicating that somebody was standing over here, 
4 that's not indicated or standing over him at a close 
5 range? 
6 A That's possible. When we say close range, 
7 it still did not deposit any evidence of close range 
8 discharge on 
9 So not as close as we 
10 are? 
A Not as close as we are. That's a whole 11 
12 another topic. I don't know if we want to get into 
13 that, you may have already addressed it, you know, 
14 at what distance does this stuff still deposit onto 
15 the skin. And I can just give a ballpark average, 
16 I'm not a ballistics expert, but with a standard 
17 handgun, it's about 2 feet to still get stippling 
18 and then within a foot you can get soot. 
19 So if I'm two feet away from you with 
20 a standard handgun, standard ammunition, you are not 
21 going to have any evidence of close range discharge. 
22 So having said that, this 
23 is 12. It is at least 2 feet away? 
24 A Ballpark, yes, 2 feet away. But the 
25 weapon needs to be test fired with the exact same

1 ammunition that was used. 
2 I understand. That's an 
3 educated guess. 
4 A Educated guess I would say greater than 
5 2 feet. 
6 Okay. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. The next image? 
8 A So just a closer up image here, small 
9 discoloration here and then an abrasion there. 
10 Again, I cannot tell you what caused that and I 
11 really wouldn't put much significance into it. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And the abrasion, you can't 
13 even say if it was contemporaneous with the 
14 shooting. 
15 A I cannot. I would have to re-review all 
16 the images from the first autopsy again. I remember 
17 seeing some of these abrasions there, but I believe 
18 Dr. called them postmortem, which it is 
19 possible. Once the body is down on the ground, it 
20 is being manipulated and put in a body bag, 
21 abrasions can still occur. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: Is that what a fingernail 
23 would look like? 
24 A

Here? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah. 
No, a lot of the fingernail abrasions that 
4 we see in forensics are in cases of strangulation 
5 and they literally look like curve linear little U 
6 shaped abrasions. This kind of just looks irregular 
7 to me. I don't really have an opinion on it.

MS. ALIZADEH: Yes, sorry. 
MS. WHIRLEY: No problem. I'm going back, 
16 sorry, let me go forward. 
17 A So now we're moving back over to the right 
18 hand here and again, some small defects, a little 
19 abrasion here and there. I really, again, I cannot 
20 tell you what caused them, just small abrasions. 
21 So now we're looking at his right 
22 flank. I had the photographer take this image cause 
23 now you can see the trajectory of this gunshot 
24 wound. 
25 Here is the entrance gunshot wound to

1 the right lateral chest and this is where they 
2 recovered that round that we saw that defect from 
3 the prior autopsy. It is basically going front to 
4 back and a little bit downward. 
5 And while it goes through this 
6 course, it doesn't actually enter the chest cavity, 
7 but it fractures the eighth rib and a splinter of 
8 that bone actually injured the right lung on the 
9 lower lobe. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) This is a gunshot wound 
11 from the front? 
12 A Correct, correct. Here is your entrance 
13 here and this is where the round was recovered. 
14 Q And in this image, because we can't see 
15 the hands or feet of the body, where is his head? 
16 A His head would be up to this side and the 
17 feet would be down here. (indicating)

25 would have disabled him. It would hurt, but it

1 wouldn't disable him. 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) If someone received that 
3 wound, could they run 25 feet? 
4 A Yes, yes. Again, another image here. We 
5 kind of put his arm back and you can see his armpit 
6 and again entrance gunshot wound here, and that is 
7 where they recovered that round. 
8 Just because we haven't mentioned it 
9 yet, we haven't really described that other wound 
10 here on the right clavicle. What it did on the 
11 inside he had about 400 milliliters of blood in his 
12 right chest cavity. That's about like a can of 
13 Coke. A can of Coke is about 350 milliliters, so a 
14 decent amount of blood in his right chest. 
15 And again, this fractured a rib that 
16 caused injury to the lung and that gunshot wound to 
17 the right clavicle area fractured the clavicle and 
18 then it went right through the upper lobe of the 
19 right lung. So quite a bit of injury to the right 
20 side of his chest. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: We're going to ask the same 
22 question. If someone received those injuries that 
23 then injured his lung, would that immediately 
24 incapacitate a person? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
They would not.
