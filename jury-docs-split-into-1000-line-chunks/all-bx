1 window looking and, urn, my eyes, actually, I was 
2 still kind of focused, I was focused on both of 
3 them, but mainly on Dorian because he was still 
4 closer to the officer than Mike because Mike, he ran 
5 kind of fast at that time, but as I see Dorian 
6 ducking down looking at the officer shooting, I was 
7 kind of thinking that the officer was, he was going

9 friend ran to and come over and shoot him.
