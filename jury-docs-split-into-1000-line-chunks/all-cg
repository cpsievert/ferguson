1 obviously, won't come across on this recording. But 
2 in the beginning when you saw the, the tussle in the 
3 car, can you describe for me or show me what you 
4 actually saw Michael Brown do and what the police

6 Well, actually, as I just 
7 stated to them, from my porch I can only see from 
8 the passenger side. 
9 Okay. 
10 I don't know if he had 
11 grabbed him or what, but you could see them tussling 
12 in the car, they were moving around. 
13 When you say he grabbed him --
14 I don't know who grabbed who. 
15 I know. When you say he? 
16 The police officer. 
17 Okay. 
18 Because he was walking, he 
19 must have said something to him and he was 
20 approaching the truck. Then we saw the tussling. 
21 Let me ask you, you said he 
22 must have said something to him, you mean --
23 I think the officer said 
24 something to him because Michael started walking 
25 towards the truck.

2 to ask you, what made you say, when you say he, I'm 
3 trying to figure out. 
4 I'll make sure I state it. 
5 Okay. I know when you use the 
6 expression he must have said something, that's one 
7 of those assumptions. When you say that, I want to 
8 you to explain that's why you are making that 
9 assumption. 
10 Well, I'm assuming he said it 
11 because he was approaching the car. I mean, if the 
12 officer tells me to stop and come here, I'm coming 
13 there, okay. 
14 Okay. 
15 I'm going to approach you, I 
16 want to talk to you. I'm going to find what is 
17 going on. 
18 That's fine, that makes sense. 
19 But I could see them 
20 tussling, you know, and after that is when the first 
21 shot rang out. 
22 Let me ask you about the 
23 tussling specifically. I know you said from what 
24 your vantage point was, can you describe from your 
25 vantage point what Michael Brown's position was?

He was outside the car door. 
Okay. 
Outside the truck door. He 
4 was in one of those big 4x4, not 4x4, SUVs. 
5 Right. 
6 He was on the outside and the 
7 officer was still in the truck. 
8 And how is Michael Brown's 
9 body? 
10 He was like, he was, I could 
11 see the top of his head, he had a hat on. 
12 Okay. 
13 I could see the top of his 
14 head, and then he dropped down and he disappeared 
15 for a minute. Next time I saw his head is when I 
16 heard the shot, that's when he popped up. 
17 Okay. 
18 Okay. 
19 Were you able to see from your 
20 vantage point whether Michael Brown's body was bent 
21 over --
22 From my vantage point I can 
23 say clearly he was not inside that truck. He was 
24 partially, maybe his head, was right there at the 
25 officer's head.

11 Okay. 
12 I could see his body, see his 
13 torso, I could see maybe from like the shoulders up, 
14 jostling around like they are moving back and forth 
15 like this, just like some kind of tug of war or 
16 something was going on. 
17 Okay. Just for the recording 
18 won't pick up what you are. You are kind of leaning

3 A matter of seconds.

17 had ran around to the side of the building, but

19 the reason that I heard and read that he was

1 away, the officer was not shooting at him; is that 
2 correct? 
3 No, he didn't shoot then. 
4 Okay. 
5 He didn't fire, he already 
6 had fired one shot when he came around to the back 
7 and assumed the position. He yelled at him to stop, 
8 which Michael had already stopped, when Michael 
9 turned around, he told him again, stop. 
10 Okay. 
11 Michael took a step off the 
12 sidewalk. As soon as his foot hit the street, the 
13 officer let loose, wham, wham, wham. 
Okay. 
Right. 
14 
15 
16 So that initial shot though 
17 occurred inside the vehicle, correct? 
Correct. 18 
19 Okay. So you're saying that 
20 the next time any shots were fired was when Michael 
21 Brown was facing the officer; is that correct? 
22 Correct. 
23 And that was after the officer 
24 said stop? 
25 Right.

1 And then he didn't shoot until 
2 Michael Brown made a movement? 
3 Made a movement. 
4 And the movement was totally 
5 opposite, correct? 
6 Right. He took a step to the 
7 street. It looked like he was giving up. Because 
8 that is what we were saying. He is giving up, he is 
9 giving up, you know, we're looking at him, he's 
10 giving up. But then as soon as he took a step, he 
11 got his foot in the street, he fired three shots. 
12 All right. Let me ask you 
13 about when you said he had his hand up. You had 
14 described previously that he was standing, as you 
15 said, his hands up around where the shoulders were, 
16 his palms were facing him. 
17 No, they were like this. 
18 Palms are facing the officer, they were like this. 
19 Indicating) 
20 Okay. 
21 You are the police officer, I 
22 turned around and I did like this.

1 understand. From my understanding when the police 
2 were interviewed by the County Police, you described 
3 he kind of stopped and looked down to his right? 
4 When he stopped at this time, 
5 yes. He kind of, when he stepped off, he was still 
6 like this, but he had his hands up, he was still 
7 trying to find out where he was shot to me. 
8 And then tell me what makes you 
9 say that? 
10 Because he looked down to his 
11 side. 
12 Okay. You said his right side? 
13 Yeah, this side, yeah, 
14 looking on this right side and then he took a step 
15 out. And he had his hands up and as soon as he took 
16 that step and got to street, maybe about to, he is a 
17 big guy, he could have made it about three steps. 
18 Let me ask you this, when he's 
19 running, he stops in front of the driveway. Based 
20 upon your vantage point, you think that he stopped 
21 because he was looking at to see where he was shot? 
22 Yes. 
23 Okay. So when he did that, at 
24 that moment he stopped, where were his hands 
25 initially?

Like this, he had them like 
2 this. He took them away from his body to see, he 
3 was like looking, he was looking. 
4 All right. That's a little bit 
5 different --
6 No, I told it before, I said 
7 when he stopped he was looking, he was like this, 
8 his hands were not steady like this, but he had them 
9 up to look at because he's a big guy, he had to look 
10 and see what was up. 
11 He was like moving his arms. 
12 Moving his arms to see what 
13 was going on. 
14 You have your palms sort of 
15 facing you like he was checking --
16 Right, he's checking out his 
17 own body. 
18 Okay. 
19 Okay. But when he turned to 
20 face the officer he was like this. He had his hands 
21 up, palm facing the officer like, okay, you got me. 
22 He had already told him to stop. 
23 All right. I need to just go 
24 back and try and (inaudible) a little bit. When he 
25 was checking out his body, were you able to see?

1 I can't tell. 
2 Is there anything that stood 
3 out to you? 
4 Nothing stood out to me. 
5 Okay. 
6 You know. 
7 And so when he turned around 
8 and took that step is when he had his palms out? 
9 Right. 
10 So right after that when the 
11 officer started shooting, what did Michael Brown do? 
12 After he fired that first 
13 round, that first volley. He hit him, he started 
14 staggering, he first kind of went back like, pow, 
15 from the impact. 
16 Okay. 
17 And then he started 
18 staggering. And he was looking at the officer as he 
19 brought his head up, he looked down, oh, God, I've 
20 been shot. He looked up at the officer and he was 
21 looking at him and he was staggering, he was trying 
22 to stay on his feet. And myself and my family is 
23 telling him stop, dude, stop, stop, stop. 
24 Were you actually saying that 
25 out loud?

1 Yes, he couldn't hear us, you 
2 know, from where we live. 
3 I know he couldn't hear you, 
4 but were you actually yelling it in hopes? 
5 Hoping that he would hear but 
6 he was staggering. We could see that he was 
7 staggering and he took about, I don't know, three or 
8 four more steps, but as he was taking his steps 
9 forward at that time, the officer took a few steps 
10 back, he was still in his spot. When Michael took 
11 the other steps and he was staggering, his body was 
12 like -- can I stand up, please? 
13 Yeah, absolutely. 
14 Okay. He was standing up, he 
15 was shot. He was leaning like this, but his head 
16 was like this. And he was standing up staggering, 
17 he was trying to stay up on his feet like this. 
18 Okay. 
19 And he was definitely, we 
20 were yelling at him stop, stop, stop. My 
21 sister-in-law and said, oh, God, he's 
22 getting ready to kill him, he's getting ready to 
23 kill him. And no sooner than he said that, no 
24 sooner those words came out of their mouth, he was 
25 going down, it looks like he was going down. And he

1 let off four more shots pow, pow, pow, pow. 
2 Okay. When the officer was 
3 shooting was when Michael Brown was coming towards 
4 him; is that right? 
5 Yeah, he was not charging 
6 him, he was defenseless, hands up, he was trying to 
7 stay on his feet and you could see that his knees 
8 was beginning to buckle, he was going down. When he 
9 shot him as he was going down, he hit face first, 
10 splat. 
11 Where were his arms when he 
12 fell to the ground? You are showing arms at either 
13 side of his head? 
14 When his body hit is when I 
15 ran up there his arm, one was like, I can't exactly 
16 tell on the body, one was like this when he hit 
17 down. I guess they moved when he hit the ground, 
18 but he was dead on the way down. 
19 Can you picture where his arms 
20 were on the ground? 
21 Kind of like. 
22 I don't want you to guess if 
23 you don't know. 
24 No, I can't say for sure.

1 I didn't really want to see it, you know, because 
2 when I ran up there and I saw who it was, I'm like, 
3 oh, my God. I just saw him earlier this morning. 
4 I'll get to that in a second, 
5 but let me just clarify. So you saw two additional, 
6 two volleys of shots --
7 Right. 
8 Correct? 
9 Right. 
10 Each time the officer was 
11 firing, Michael Brown was coming towards him? 
12 Yes. 
13 Okay. And at no time did 
14 Michael Brown say anything, correct? 
15 I could not tell or hear if 
16 he did say anything. 
17 You didn't hear him yell, don't 
18 shoot? 
19 No, I didn't. 
20 Were you able to hear the 
21 officer say stop? 
22 Oh, yeah, he was very loud. 
23 You didn't hear Michael Brown 
24 say anything like okay, okay, okay? 
25 No, I didn't hear that.

8 You were able to hear the

10 Oh, yeah. 
11 You didn't hear anything from 
12 Michael Brown? 
13 No. 
14 From your vantage point, you 
15 didn't see his mouth moving as though he was saying 
16 anything? 
17 My eyes was really focused on 
18 the officer because when he started moving, 
19 staggering forward, I wanted to see what he was 
20 getting read to do cause everybody was like, he is 
21 getting ready to kill him. 
22 Okay. 
23 So I wanted to see what he 
24 was getting ready to do, but Michael was staggering. 
25 You could see him clearly staggering, you know. And

1 then when he started like he was going down, he 
2 fired again and that's when I said, oh, my God, he 
3 just killed him. 
4 Okay. So I just want to 
5 (inaudible), when this was all happening, your 
6 attention shifted to the officer, correct? 
7 I could still see Michael, I 
8 wanted to see what he was going to do. I had both 
9 of them in line of sight. 
10 Okay. Is it fair to say that 
11 Michael was more, just based on how you are 
12 describing it and the visual you just gave me, is it 
13 fair to say that Michael was more in your peripheral 
14 vision at that point? 
15 Both of them, both of them. 
16 From my vantage point, I can see both, okay. But to 
17 say, now I'm trying to make this as clear as I can. 
18 I can see both of them, but as Michael was 
19 staggering toward him, you know, trying to keep his 
20 balance, as he was moving forward, you could see, I 
21 could see the officer stepping back. 
22 When he took those steps back and Michael 
23 was staggering forward, I thought, oh, my God, 
24 that's when they said he is getting ready to shoot 
25 him. Sure enough, as soon they said that, he let

5 Yeah, we wanted Michael to

7 , he's getting ready to kill him. 
8 Let me ask you this, 
9 On August 12th, I want to take you 
10 through what you said at that time. 
11 You said as he faces the officer, this is 
12 Detective asking you this, as he faces the 
13 officer, you say that his hands go up to a point 
14 where you said about to his shoulders almost. 
15 Right. 
16 That's when he has his palms 
17 sort of facing himself and he's looking over his 
18 body? 
19 When he got first shot and he 
20 got to the driveway, his hands were up facing 
21 himself because he was looking like at himself. 
22 Right, let me

2 officer. 
3 Okay. You went on to say 
4 back on August the 12th, Detective says, your 
5 arms are like palms up and hands and fingers are 
6 roughly shoulder height, is that fair enough to say? 
7 You say yeah, about close to his shoulder. 
8 Do you agree with that? 
9 Yeah, yes. 
10 With his palms facing 
11 towards himself like this? 
12 No, not turned, his hands are 
13 like this. 
14 No, I'm talking about --
15 They're not, excuse me, what 
16 you are saying, the hands are pointed toward him, 
17 they were not, I didn't say they were pointed toward 
18 him. I said his hands were like this. I described 
19 it. I didn't say they were pointed toward him. The 
20 only time I said his hands was anywhere near is when 
21 he first got shot.
