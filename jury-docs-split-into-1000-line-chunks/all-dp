Yes. 
What happens to people? 
Makes them really high. 
Okay. When you spoke with Michael the 
23 first time before he went up into the building, to 
24 you did he appear to be high? 
25 A No, he appeared to me to be slow in

1 nature, like he needed somebody to talk to. 
2 Where I thought he was just bored up 
3 there in his apartment, heard me down there and 
4 wanted to come down and just talk. 
5 Q Why do you think that, why do you say 
6 A Whenever he would talk and give me an 
7 answer, he would always put his head back and his 
8 eyes would flicker. I'm like, oh geez, I don't 
9 know. 
10 Q And you had never spoken to him before 
11 this, right? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Right. 
So you wouldn't know what he would have 
14 sounded like on another day, right? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Right. 
When he would speak to you, would he speak 
17 rapidly or slow? 
18 A No, it was real slow, but when he talked 
19 his head would go back and his eyes, I just thought 
20 he had an issue up there or something. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Was he high? I don't know, but it didn't 
23 seem like he was high to me. It just seemed like he 
24 was a little bit slow and was just wanting to talk 
25 to somebody.

1 Q So what about when he came out of the 
2 building, you saw him briefly, did he say anything 
3 to you the second time when he came out of the

So did Michael speak at that time? 
Michael said that. 
Okay. Did he speak in the same manner 
had heard before? 
I didn't notice the head going back, but 
12 he talked real slow. 
13 Q From what you observed or the time you had 
14 to observe him on the second time when he came out 
15 of the building, did you have any impression that he 
16 was high or intoxicated or anything? 
17 A I didn't think so. I mean, I didn't have 
18 that. When they're walking away, they just walked 
19 away and I got in my truck drove it across the 
20 parking lot to the next building. 
21 Q So when you saw him and the other guy walk 
22 away, where did they walk? You can use the pointer. 
23 A They took off right here and started 
24 cutting through here and up that way. I don't know 
25 what happened after here, this is the way they took

store I know of around there. (indicating) 
Q So you saw them walk toward Canfield Drive

A 
Q 
Yes. 
As if they were going to be walking up 
Yes. 
Urn, so how much time passed before 
12 something happened? 
13 A I thought it would have been like 15 
14 minutes. When they left, I drove my truck to right 
15 here, there was no cars there, so I pulled it right 
16 up over here, and started walking over here to 
17 get the Bobcat. 
18 So however long it took to walk there 
19 to come back and take three little scoops out. I 
20 figured it would be 15 minutes. In my eyes I'm a 
21 foreman, so I would think that stuff takes less time 
22 than you know.

Q

You didn't have a watch? 
I didn't have a watch. I would have just

Q 
A 
Okay. 
By then was getting out of the 
11 machine, and I got up and walked over to my truck 
12 and I asked , did you hear that? And he said, 
13 yeah, it sounded like a gunshot. Then all of the 
14 sudden by the time I got to my truck there was 
15 another one. By that time that pop happened, he was 
16 back by my truck with me. I don't think he was next 
17 to me yet. 
18 Q Now let me back up. So when you're over 
19 in this area and you are now working in a different 
20 hole and digging the crumbs out as you said.

Yes. 
Did you notice anything going on over 
23 here, did you notice a police car or any other 
24 vehicle or anything? 
25 A No. When I heard that pop, I looked that

right there. (indicating) 
Q What kind of machine are you talking
