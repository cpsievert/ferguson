3 When I said , what I was thinking of 
4 for him to testify about the lack of information 
5 flowing back and forth at that time because he was 
6 from the get-go, Detective has been in charge 
7 of the investigation, but of course, he's only in 
8 charge of the county officers. But as the primary 
9 detective, he was talking to the FBI, but again, he 
10 could clarify this for you, but I believe that at 
11 that time on the 16th, there wasn't a lot of back 
12 and forth going on. Sharing of information so to 
13 speak between the County and the FBI about who had 
14 been talked to and what they said and the FBI did 
15 this area canvas on their own. 
16 It was their desire that the County not be 
17 involved. They wanted to have their own independent 
18 investigation so they said we're going to do this, 
19 we don't want County coming with us or being 
20 involved in that for whatever reason. 
21 So you're right, it was that 
22 did the interview with

1 interviews, so how do they determine like, I mean, 
2 it is freshly on their mind on the 9th or three days 
3 after, but then when you come behind like weeks 
4 later, how beneficial is that? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, that's going to be up 
6 for you all to talk about when you begin your 
7 deliberations. If there's a difference in a 
8 statement that's given closer to the time and then 
9 there's a statement that was done after that, how 
10 long after that, what are the circumstances of the 
11 statement, what about, you know, these are all 
12 things for you to consider. If there are 
13 differences, why are there differences, you know. 
14 Could it be that the first statement was 
15 done because it is brief and then as you know, the 
16 FBI has come along and Department of Justice have 
17 done subsequent interviews that seem to be longer in 
18 duration. Are they being more detailed? These are 
19 all things that you are going to have to decide for 
20 yourself. If there are differences, what do you 
21 make of those differences. 
22 So now we're going to listen to a recorded 
23

statement of 
we've heard from a

who testified that

1 confused by our asking it, feel free to stop us 
2 because we are going to assume that you understood 
3 when you answer it. And sometimes we trip over our 
4 words and don't make sense anyway, so don't think 
5 that you are insulting us by correcting us. 
6 MS. Okay. 
7 And all your answers need to be 
8 out loud because it is being recorded. There may be 
9 a transcript made. So if you nod your head, I may 
10 ask is that a yes or is that a no. 
11 
12 
MS. Yes. 
So it is totally normal to do 
13 that. If I do that, I'm not doing that to you to be 
14 rude, okay? 
15 And just referenced that you just 
16 listened to your statement is about 8 and a half 
17 minutes long. We have a transcript that you are 
18 following along with. Do you remember hearing that 
19 statement and is it fair as much as you remember 
20 with what you said? 
MS. Yes. 21 
22 Okay. And so we don't want to 
23 really make you rehash everything, we just wanted to 
24 ask you some follow-up questions from it. You know,

1 know you only saw, you know, the beginning and the 
2 end, we don't want you to think that we're looking 
3 for anything and everything possible, just what you, 
4 yourself, know, okay. 
5 So, therefore, we just have some follow-up 
6 things for you. And one of the reasons we wanted 
7 you to listen to your statement is because it has 
8 been seven and a half weeks and as you know, this 
9 has been on the news and people talk a lot about it, 
10 but our goal is to find out what you, yourself, 
11 know, not what you may have heard on the news. 
12 So a lot of times it helps to refresh your 
13 memory and kind of separate out what you said at the 
14 time and what you, yourself, versus what you may 
15 have heard based upon the news or the police report, 
16 does that make sense? 
17 
18 
MS. Yes. 
Okay. Also, we know it is 
19 late, you came here from work. At any point you 
20 think I've had enough, even though you're in the 
21 FBI, feel free to say I've had enough, I don't want 
22 to talk any more being, okay?

24 
MS. Okay. 
This is entirely voluntary. We 
25 certainly don't want to force you to be here.

1 Basically we are just looking for what happened and 
2 the truth. 
3 So we have to tell you as I tell everybody 
4 that, it's a crime to make false statements to 
5 federal agents. So we always say people are very 
6 honest people. If you're going to exaggerate or 
7 lie, you are better off not saying anything at all 
8 then like a lie, okay? 
9 
10 
MS. Okay. 
And so basically, like I said 
11 we just want to know what happened. If you assume 
12 something or you're guessing at something, or you're 
13 talking about what other people heard, that's fine 
14 as long as you let us know that you are assuming,

We just really want to know

20 remember it. If you don't know the answer, I don't

6 MS. Urn, actually, like I said, as 
7 I was behind the police officer, I noticed that he 
8 did stop because I was directly behind him, so I had 
9 to slow down also. 
10 Okay. 
11 MS. In the process of up to two 
12 young men walking, Michael Brown and the friend with 
13 the dreads walking down the street, he did stop.

9 Before the car started rocking 
10 back and forth, did you see any sort of interaction 
11 between the guy with the dreads, Michael Brown and 
12 the police officer? 
13 MS. Actually, I did not because 
14 how my car sits and how tall the truck was, so I 
15 didn't see directly what was going on inside. 
16 So from your vantage point as 
17 soon as you stopped, what's the first thing that you 
18 remember seeing?

20 just stopping.

9 out. 
10 So the recording can't pick

12 proceeded to go, you we are taking about the guy

7 Okay.

Yes, ma'am. 
At this point is when you start 
3 ducking; is that right? 
4 MS. Right. After I heard the 
5 first shot and I see Michael Brown jump out of the 
6 car, yes, ma'am, I was terrified. When they start 
7 running because actually, they ran past my car, so I 
8 didn't know what was going on. 
9 And that makes sense. They are 
10 running past your car and you just heard gunshots 
11 and you were terrified?

MS. 
MS. 
Yes, ma'am. 
You started to duck, correct? 
Yes, ma'am. 
15 You said you were able to see 
16 that the police officer ran past as well, correct? 
17 MS. Yes, ma'am. 
18 And was there a pause between 
19 the time that the boys started running past you and 
20 the police officer? 
21 MS. There actually was. Just 
22 because we was trying to get out of the truck at the 
23 time. So once we took off running, once Michael 
24 Brown and the guy with the dreads took off running, 
25 that's when I noticed the police comes out.

Okay. So there was a little 
Yes, ma'am, just enough time 
4 to open up the car door. 
5 For you to open up the car 
6 door? 
7 MS. No, no, for the police 
8 officer to open the car door and get out. 
9 Did you actually see him open 
10 up the car door? 
11 MS. I could not see from the 
12 other side of the car. 
13 Okay. 
14 MS. But once he came from away 
15 from the car in my view where I can actually see 
16 him.

1 And you don't how long you 
2 blacked out for? 
3 MS. Actually, it was for a short 
4 period of time because once I proceeded to sit up 
5 and I looked out my rear view mirror, that's when I 
6 saw the end, when actually him running, his back was 
7 turned and he turned around.

1 MS. Leading up to that, no, he's 
2 running from him with his back from him, with his 
3 back from him. 
4 All right. 
5 MS. I do know that. 
6 But you didn't see any of this 
7 go on because you were ducking? 
8 MS. I was ducking as the police 
9 officer came towards my car, I got down, yes, ma'am. 
10 Okay. And you heard that 
11 initial shot from the SUV, correct? 
12 MS. Yes, ma'am. 
13 And then you heard, as you 
14 describe, those three shots at the end?

Okay. And you describe that 
17 the guy with the dreads came over to the passenger 
18 side of your car trying to get in? 
19 MS. Yes, ma'am.

1 little bit, but when I was down, I did open up my 
2 eyes. I was still down, and that's when I saw the 
3 young man with the dreads, where had the door 
4 open, he had it slung open. He was on the curb, but 
5 he had -- he crawled. You could tell that he 
6 crawled. He was in the car and he just basically 
7 asked me could I get him away from here because it 
8 is crazy. 
9 Is that what he said? 
10 MS. Yes, ma'am.

1 down. That's all I had, I mean, that was the only 
2 thing that came to my mind, just get down. 
3 Okay. And then 
4 Obviously, you didn't let 
5 the guy with the dreads in your car? 
6 MS. No, sir, I did not. 
7 Why was it that you wouldn't 
8 let him in your car? 
9 MS. Actually, I didn't know what 
10 was going on for one and I was actually, didn't have 
11 a clue if he had or who had it, I just didn't know. 
12 It wasn't something that I was willing to do. 
13 If he had what? 
14 MS. Actually, I didn't know if he 
15 had a gun, I didn't know what was going on. 
16 You didn't know what was 
17 going on? 
18 MS. Actually, I didn't know what 
19 was going. 
20 And so for that reason you 
21 didn't allow the guys with the dreads in the car 
22 with you? 
MS. Yes, sir. 23 
24 MS. Do you know if he stayed 
25 there or he went elsewhere?

Actually, just for a few 
2 minutes, just for a few minutes, like I said, after 
3 I told him no, he disappeared. 
4 Now, I don't know where he went, I wasn't 
5 focusing on him. I was trying to see what was going 
6 on. 
7 So I was trying to ask you 
8 this, when he said to you get me out of here, it is

Okay. Did you know that he 
17 wanted to get in the car? 
18 MS. Actually, just by what he 
19 said, the statement that he made to me. 
20 I guess what I'm trying to 
21 figure out is, how did you let him know that you 
22 weren't letting him in the car? 
23 MS. Actually, for one, I wasn't 
24 moving it at the time.

3 Did say anything to him?

5 just hollered the same thing, get down.

7 point you looked up and you were looking in your 
8 rear view mirror?
