That means he's on the scene. I have to

10 you're not hearing the siren in the recordings

Q

Why? 
Urn, because I know 25 was looking for 
12 another one, so I know something transpired and I 
13 hear static and I'm not, they're not communicating 
14 with me. So the years I've been there and I've 
15 known a lot of these men since they were small, I 
16 say small, to me they're like my children almost. 
17 I've known them since they were rookies. I'm 
18 concerned about their well being because it is odd 
19 for them not to talk to me. 
20 Q Okay. The two officers that you hear 
21 saying that they're going to Canfield and you can

So Frank 23 is Sergeant ? 
Yes. 
What is this, what are you saying to him 
4 in this call? 
5 A He is still on the call on Kirk with the 
6 elderly female and I'm telling him I'm unable to get 
7 ahold of anyone at the agency. He has requested and 
8 I've also tried United Way and they are not 
9 available. 
10 Q So prior to these recordings that we are 
11 listening to, he had called into dispatch and asked 
12 you to try to get ahold of somebody with an agency 
13 that maybe could assist this woman?

Q 
Page 154 
I believe so. 
Is it typical for a supervisor to respond 
4 to a call or assist? 
5 A Usually a supervisor will respond if there

All right. Did somebody call for that? 
I believe the officers asked for that. I 
3 think they called us on the phone and asked for that 
4 but there was also a firetruck that was cutting 
5 through Canfield back to West Florissant that was 
6 assisting the child with difficulty breathing that 
7 automatically stopped. You can hear the fire 
8 channel when you are in dispatch, correct?

2 hear them, the traffic coming out on that channel as

2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) But there is another 
3 call that you actually responded to because you 
4 couldn't tell what was being said or who was 
5 calling; is that right? 
6 A Yes. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? 
8 That 
9 would be the static call? 
10 A Yes. 
11 If that call is on a 
12 different channel, would you be able to hear that 
13 static as a dispatcher. 
14 A When you say different channel, are you 
15 talking about a channel on their portable or a 
16 channel

1 Canfield, was it 12:21:05, that's not real time, but 
2 it is a time, correct? 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. You want me to double 
4 check the time? 
5 Well, no, I wrote it 
6 down. I know that's what was on the track. 
7 And then on 378, that's if we have a 
8 detective on duty respond as well. So that's pretty 
9 much, we can say that's pretty much after everything 
10 is done as far as the shooting that was at 12:23:11, 
11 which was like two seconds or is that two minutes. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Two minutes. 
13 This whole thing pretty 
14 much was over in two minutes, that's a fairly short 
15 period of time. So, I mean, we are hearing people
