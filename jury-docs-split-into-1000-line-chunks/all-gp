A Yes. 2 
3 Q And then responds to him saying you're 
4 at the scene and what's 11:34 mean? 
A That's the current time. 5 
6 Q So she's looked at the clock and she says 
7 what time it is on her clock? 
A Yes. 8 
9 Q So she has Frank 25, Officer Gibbons has 
10 arrived at the scene at 11:34? 
A Yes. 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So the next track? 
13 When 
14 we're talking about the clock discrepancies. 
A Yes. 15 
16 Like track 323 was at 
17 11:46:04 and this is 11:34, there is like 12 minutes 
18 difference. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, you are looking at, 
20 when you say track 323, which is the first call I 
21 played, the time I gave you, the time and date is 
22 what is on the call, not the clock she's looking at. 
23 Right, that's what I'm 
24 saying, we're talking about the clock difference we 
25 are referring to earlier.

1 MS. ALIZADEH: There might be a difference 
2 in a clock. 
3 Right, right. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Actually, she says it's 
5 11:34 and that's 329. And this says it is 
6 August 9th, 2014 at 115321. 
7 Okay. Up there, good. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So the clock they're 
9 looking at and calling out is the actual time, 
10 correct? 
11 
12 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So the times that are 
13 listed on here aren't the actual times, however, the 
14 time discrepancies I think would be accurate. So 
15 the 20 minutes from one call and then the next 
16 minute the call is 20 minutes later, I think that 
17 that would be accurate.

Q 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, I'm playing 330. 
(Playing of the recording.) 
Okay. Now, we've heard a lot of static at 
22 the beginning of that call. Can you tell if that 
23 officer is on his portable or on the mobile? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, he's on his portable. 
Do you recognize who that is?

1 A You know it sounds like Officer Wilson, 
2 but it's hard to say. I would have to be closer in 
3 order to hear it. 
4 Q And so at the beginning when we are 
5 hearing static is that because somebody is keying up 
6 their mike or what was that static from? 
7 A That is because their on their mobile, I'm 
8 sorry, their portable and they're out walking on 
9 feet and as he's walking, he's moving in between the 
10 buildings. So the signal, instead of trying to bend 
11 around a building is straight and we can read it a 
12 lot better because there's not a building in the 
13 way. It is hard for me to explain that type. 
14 Q So would this be an example of a time when 
15 an officer is transmitting something and you can 
16 tell something is being transmitted, but you can't 
17 hear it and then as he continues to walk, you can 
18 hear what is being said? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Because of the static you are not 
21 able to tell which officer that was?

3 A Yes. 
4 Q Okay. Can you recognize their voices? 
5 A The second officer is Officer The 
6 first I'm not sure is possibly Officer Wilson.
