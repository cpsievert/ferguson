MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, all right. 
Can I just mention that, as I say, this 
13 isn't my first rodeo in Missouri, I've been here 
14 before, I've investigated, I just recently, a year 
15 or two ago, talked to the St. Louis Major Crime 
16 Unit, which works with Illinois, nearby Illinois. 
17 spent a lot of time in Columbia, Missouri 
18 investigating unexplained deaths in the Harris S. 
19 Truman Veterans Hospital, I've been involved with a 
20 number of investigations in veteran hospitals where 
21 medical personnel may have intentionally killed 
22 patients. 
23 And I've lectured to the Missouri 
24 Highway Patrol and things like that. We always, 
25 medical examiners are coming to some jurisdictions,

1 always work under the guise of being carpetbaggers, 
2 and to a certain extent we are carpetbaggers coming 
3 from away, but I've been accepted in other 
4 situations as reasonable in Missouri. 
5 So I hope what I may have may have 
6 sounded unreasonable isn't as nutty as it might 
7 sound. It is just after 50 years in this business, 
8 one isn't afraid to give opinions. 
9 I'd like to know if you 
10 know, what is the reason that a lawyer from Michael 
11 Brown's family don't give you official copy of the 
12 autopsy, why what is the reason? 
13 A This is the first I've heard. I don't 
14 speak frequently to the lawyers, this is the first I 
15 heard that they were given the official autopsy 
16 before it came out in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: I didn't say it was before 
18 it was leaked, I just said it was in late October. 
19 
20 
21 
A I think I heard the I got the leak copy 
somewhere around late October also. I didn't know 
that, I'll ask them. If I've been under the 
22 assumption that the family, it wasn't released. 
23 Normal people can't interpret autopsy reports once 
24 the autopsy is released, you need a physician to 
25 interpret what it all means, all the different

1 organs and bodies and medical terms. 
2 So I expect that once it was 
3 released, I would be asked to explain it to the 
4 family and I wasn't asked to explain it to the 
5 family until later on. 
6 Giving you the copy is not 
7 released to the press, it is a lawyer, who has the 
8 official copy. What is the reason they don't give 
9 you the copy, I don't understand that? 
10 A I don't know, I'll have to ask him. 
11 It don't seem correct to me, 
12 but that is my opinion. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify, Doctor, 
14 where did you get, I know you said you saw the copy 
15 on the internet? 
16 A No, I said probably. I got a duplicate 
17 copy was sent to me. 
18 
19 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Do you know who sent it. 
I think it was an attorney or it was a 
20 newspaper reporter wanting me to comment on it or 
21 something. It was emailed, something was emailed to 
22 me. I think it was from the reporter, from the 
23 attorney, but that was from St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
24 release, which I agree with the gentleman, it is 
25 interesting, I'm not going to take it as gospel.

1 Did Mr. Brown's parents ever 
2 say in your questioning of them that he had like a 
3 childhood behavior problem or anything like that? 
4 A He did not. I spoke to the mom and dad. 
5 One of the questions I wanted to know, the purpose 
6 of the autopsy is any surgical or medical 
7 conditions, and as far as I was told, was perfectly 
8 healthy. I know sometimes families, especially when 
9 they're grieving, just say that and without 
10 necessarily thinking about it or anything. So as 
11 far as I know, as I stand here today, sit here 
12 today, as far as the autopsy and toxicology would 
13 show, I see no evidence of prior medical conditions 
14 or that he was under any treatment for medical 
15 conditions.

8 then going to be tested. 
9 So I informed you that we had those

The reason, one of the things that as the 
10 foreperson said when he swore you in and the second 
11 part of the oath you seemed a little confused about. 
12 What he said was in taking that oath, you have to

14 today.

16 was.
