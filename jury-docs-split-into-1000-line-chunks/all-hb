3 A That's correct. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: And so you rely on a 
5 toxicologist to come up with his findings and then 
6 you may or may not find that has any significance in 
7 your findings, correct? 
A That's correct. 8 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: But the affects, the 
10 findings of a board certified toxicologist, you are 
11 relying on the findings of Dr. in this case, 
12 correct? 
13 A On the findings, yes. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: So your statement that 99 
15 people out of 100 wouldn't attack a police officer, 
16 what's that based on? 
17 A Based on 20 years I worked with drug 
18 addicts, on the board of directors of a number of 
19 drug and alcohol programs in New York City. While 
20 25 years I was in New York City as medical examiner, 
21 deputy medical examiner and then chief medical 
22 examiner, we did lots of autopsies on drug users, 
23 because we got a lot of autopsy findings in that 
24 regard. I was on the board of directors and worked 
25 closely interviewing and treating drug addicts,

1 mostly heroin addicts and alcoholics, in different 
2 communities. 
3 And all of them there was an issue 
4 about marijuana because even back 20 years ago, is 
5 marijuana the gateway drug to further and more 
6 severe drug abuse, which was the general feeling as 
7 far as the federal laws went. 
8 And one of the things in talking to 
9 drug addicts and working with drug addicts, I found 
10 that marijuana did not play a significant role in 
11 their behavior except for one fact, and one fact is 
12 the significant fact was because it is illegal, the 
13 person in contact with the seller was also in 
14 contact with people who sold other drugs. They were 
15 more vulnerable to heroin, barbiturates and other 
16 things not because of their behavior, because they 
17 were in contact with people who sell illegal drugs 
18 and made them more vulnerable to it. 
19 So in my opinion working with addicts 
20 clinically, as well as autopsy findings, I think 
21 that marijuana is not any worse than alcohol. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: To clarify, Doctor, you're 
23 testifying as to an expert opinion today, are you 
24 testifying today that you have been qualified in a 
25 court of law as an expert in toxicology?

1 A Not as an expert in toxicology, the common 
2 way I'm qualified is an expert interpreting what the 
3 alcohol level means. Half the cases we do involve 
4 alcohol, either the unnatural deaths and homicides 
5 and often we're asked to interpret the, not to do 
6 it, I'm not a toxicologist, absolutely, I'm not an 
7 expert in toxicology, but I think all forensic 
8 pathologists have to be experts in interpreting 
9 drugs in the body. Is it enough to cause death. 
10 An example, we do an autopsy and the 
11 result can come back high level of barbiturates or 
12 no barbiturates and yet from the history of the 
13 autopsy we determined he died by a barbiturate 
14 overdose. The toxicologist would say how can you 
15 diagnose a barbiturate overdose. Because we do the 
16 autopsy, we see that over the five days he was in 
17 the hospital, the barbiturate overdose that brought 
18 him there got metabolize. By the time he dies, he 
19 has no barbiturates in his body, even though the 
20 cause of death is a barbiturate overdose. 
21 There is a difference between what 
22 the toxicologist is an expert in finding the 
23 marijuana, absolutely, I don't do those tests at 
24 all.

1 experts in how drugs affects the behavior or how 
2 drugs affect the human body? 
3 A Yes, that's how the drugs affects the body 
4 is a medical knowledge, not a toxicologist. And the 
5 reason I'm a forensic pathologist, certainly in New 
6 York get qualified to talk about that is because the 
7 judge decides hey, you're an expert in finding that 
8 it is a .02 or .5 or .3 alcohol, but we're going to 
9 have the doctor interpret what that means. 
10 And I think a pharmacologist is a 
11 little different, a pharmacologist gets more into 
12 the affects of the body, but toxicologists are 
13 trained in chemistry. And the smart ones get to 
14 know about the affects on the body, but not from 
15 training, that's just from common sense, as I'm 
16 talking from common sense.

18 questions?

20 person in medicine not two plus two is four, every 
21 person is different.

9 marijuana he has in his body. I'm sorry, 
10 
11 A No, no, no, you bring up an important 
12 point. That the same amount of a drug affects 
13 people differently. And I'm just saying in my 
14 experience, I've written books about drug abuse, 
15 drug abuse in general beyond from my experience with 
16 heroin addicts and alcoholics in treatment programs 
17 and I'm just, I just think that if somebody on 
18 ectasy or was having hallucinations on LSD might 
19 fight with a police officer. Somebody on heroin 
20 would go to sleep before fighting with a police 
21 officer, somebody on marijuana, I haven't, it 
22 affects people differently. I think the chances of 
23 somebody taking marijuana and fighting with a police 
24 officer and just explaining it on that basis, that 
25 might be relative for other reasons why he fights

7 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you have any information 
8 about Michael Brown's history of drug use? 
9 A Not specifically, but I think the answer 
10 that was being brought up is that, you are better at 
11 me in this, what were people saying, how was he 
12 acting before this episode would be a better 
13 indication of affects of marijuana because marijuana 
14 doesn't let you spend the day doing what you always 
15 do and then suddenly pop off and do something very 
16 different. 
17 If you are on marijuana and you are 
18 going to act out, you do it right away while it is 
19 at its peak. Then they can do things, but that 
20 would be my experience. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: So that's just based on 
22 your experience?

1 started the testimony today, you said the Brown 
2 family attorney reached out to you, what did they 
3 specially ask you to do or in what role did they ask 
4 you to take? 
5 A Yeah, the person who reached out was the 
6 attorney and he said the Brown family, I 
7 specifically remember this because it is not 
8 surprising in some way. That the mother and the 
9 father, it's now been a week, they don't know why 
10 their son died and they had other questions. And 
11 they're concerned that they might not, they have 
12 been told it might be weeks or months before they 
13 are given any information while it is being 
14 completed. 
15 So they wanted an autopsy largely to 
16 find out what, why the son died except besides 
17 reading speculations in newspapers. And also I find 
18 out when I sat down with the family, I came, I sat 
19 down with them first, what all families do they want 
20 to know, did my son suffer, you know. Did he die 
21 right away, and that was the issue. 
22 The issue wasn't did he get shot by 
23 the police because that was pretty obvious, but the 
24 issue was what happened, how many times was he shot, 
25 did he have pain and suffering because that was the

1 issue. And principally because they thought they 
2 weren't going to be able to get this any other way, 
3 to this day they haven't gotten it any other way. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me interrupt here. So, 
5 Doctor, you're unaware, I imagine, that my office 
6 did provide a copy of the Medical Examiner's Report 
7 in late October to the family's attorney? 
8 A I didn't know that, I thought that the 
9 family's attorney October, that's not far, I was 
10 told that they had a copy from the St. Louis 
11 Post-Dispatch or something. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, so you are basing 
13 this on stuff that other people have told you, 
14 correct? So if I were to tell you our office 
15 provided an official copy of the Medical Examiner's 
16 report in late October to the attorney for Michael 
17 Brown's family, whether the attorney gave it to 
18 Michael Brown's family or not, I have no information 
19 about that, but you're unaware then that we actually 
20 provided that report to the attorney in late 
21 October, correct? 
22 A Until about a week or two ago.

1 that. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: And in your experience as a 
3 medical examiner in the State of New York, I imagine 
4 there were a good number of cases that you were 
5 involved in that involved criminal investigations, 
6 correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: You understand the need at 
9 times for an autopsy findings to be kept, not made 
10 public initially while an investigation is still 
11 ongoing, would you agree that there is a, might be a 
12 need or a reason that investigators might not want 
13 to disclose that type of information? 
14 A Yes. It might be valid or not. As a 
15 medical examiner, see we are put in the middle, 
16 medical examiners should be an independent 
17 scientist. 
18 Dealing with patients, our concern is 
19 when we do autopsies, we are doing for the family 
20 and for the society in general, we always have to 
21 relate to the family. I spent a few years in 
22 internal medicine before going into pathology and 
23 that's what's important. 
24 So I have found in New York that many 
25 times when there have been encounters with

Page 93 
1 correction officers in jail, we had riots in jails 
2 and encounters with police, that the sooner you're 
3 able to tell the family what happened, remember we 
4 do an autopsy and 95 percent of the information is 
5 obtained within the day of the autopsy. We then 
6 wait for the toxicology, histology, which is usually 
7 not necessary legally. 
8 Somebody shoots somebody or gets in a 
9 car accident and is drunk, we'll call that a 
10 homicide, for example, a homicide. They wait on the 
11 autopsy report that we don't, that we don't wait for 
12 everything to come through. Even though that every 
13 shooting, every homicide there is a toxicology on, 
14 but if somebody was shot yesterday, they'll come out 
15 tomorrow and tell you what the cause of death is 
16 even though everything is not completed. 
17 So just from my experience as a chief 
18 medical examiner is that the sooner that this 
19 information is given out, it calms everybody down 
20 because one of the things I saw happening with the 
21 family here and many other families, whenever 
22 somebody dies in an encounter with the police, they 
23 immediately often don't trust the police. And then 
24 if the medical examiner doesn't release the finding 
25 right away they feel, as happened here, that the

Page 94 
1 medical examiner is covering up for the police, and 
2 that has to be dealt with. As a physician, I have 
3 to deal with that with the family. 
4 Now, sometimes it's a value to not 
5 release information because you are going to get 
6 information, you don't want people to know what 
7 happened and you don't want people to make up 
8 stories. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: For example, I saw the 
10 police officer stand over Michael Brown's body and 
11 shoot him in the back, in the head as he laid face 
12 down in the pavement, that couldn't possibly have 
13 happened based upon your findings, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: So wouldn't it be important 
16 that maybe those findings would be withheld from the 
17 general public so that witnesses who may come 
18 forward and report having witnessed this incident, 
19 the police may be able to determine the veracity or 
20 credibility of that witness if they report something 
21 that we know the findings do not support. 
22 A Yeah, that can happen. However, see in 
23 the old days the way we did things was the mantra is 
24 you got to find, interview all the witnesses, knock 
25 on doors, telephones, whatever in the first 48

1 hours. And you got to get all the stories locked 
2 down in the 48 hours and that was the police mantra, 
3 or shoe leather. 
4 Now oftentimes we're going to wait a 
5 little bit until all the DNA and the other tests 
6 come through before we interview people during the 
7 time they can also make up stories. 
8 In answer to your question, I think 
9 that if the procedure is to interview people right 
10 away, and then the autopsy findings can be released 
11 within two or three days after that, it covers both 
12 bases. I just think in my experience with families, 
13 that the transparency in situations where families 
14 don't trust what's going on. 
15 When we have seen riot situations in 
16 New York City, in Harlem, or specific ones, I'm 
17 thinking about the fact that we said yes, the death 
18 of the innocent person was caused by a police bullet 
19 and not by one of the snipers. Immediately calms 
20 things down. They are going to continue, they know 
21 we're not going to cover it. I don't know, that's 
22 my feeling as a physician. 
23 : I'm trying to stay on topic. 
24 I have a question for you and I know we have a time 
25 crunch as well. In regards to, we have been here

1 quite awhile already, my question is going back to 
2 the question I just asked you. You kind of 
3 explained why the family reached out to you. 
4 A Yes. 
5 So it seems to me when they 
6 reached out to you, you started an investigation of 
7 your own, would you say that's truthful? 
8 A Yes, within my expertise. 
9 Sure. In addition to your 
10 role as a forensic pathologist to examine the body, 
11 you began investigating on your own; is that 
12 correct? 
13 A Well, that was primarily what I did was 
14 examine the body and they asked certain questions 
15 about his death. 
16 So how did you do that 
17 investigation, outside of examining the physical 
18 body, how did you investigate? 
19 A That's my investigation is examining the 
20 body and finding out from the family what kind of 
21 medical problems the person may have had and any 
22 history that would be pertinent to interpret the 
23 autopsy findings, but it was essentially doing the

15 was given to me by the medical examiner's office.

17 autopsy report prior to your autopsy of the body? 
18 A No, no, there was no autopsy. I spoke to 
19 , the chief medical examiner, who I have 
20 known for quite a while, and been told I was doing 
21 it. We invited anybody from the office to come down

6 I'm sorry, I don't think my 
7 question was answered, I can rephrase it. Did you 
8 view the leaked autopsy prior to conducting your 
9 autopsy? 
10 A I thought I answered it. There was no 
11 leaked autopsy until a couple weeks ago. There was 
12 no autopsy, I didn't review any autopsy findings 
13 prior to my autopsy and the autopsy leaking I'm 
14 talking about was from two or three weeks ago. 
15 Sure. So you said you got

19 the internet for any other information?

21 
A No. 
You provided us a lot of 
22 information today then, I don't believe someone 
23 could just evaluate based on looking at a body. You

A I read the newspaper. 2 
3 Let me finish. You said 
4 there were drops of blood on his hands and socks 
5 that had to have come from his hand. You said that 
6 you knew he knew he was bleeding, Michael Brown,

8 kind of distances that the shooting occurred, you 
9 said that he, Michael Brown, could have been treated

13 me to be assumptions or things that you've gathered 
14 from either talking to other individuals or looking 
15 on the internet and doesn't to me seem factual or 
16 based on your role as a forensic pathologist. 
17 A An autopsy can never be evaluated in a 
18 vacuum, we always have to have other information 
19 that we get from various sources. Somebody falling 
20 out of a window will have the same injuries, whether 
21 he was pushed, whether he jumped and committed

9 going on. I read about how there was a leak about 
10 the FBI reporting that there was Brown's blood DNA

1 or in a newspaper, we are here for the truth. 
2 A I'm not, I'm not, what you call it, 
3 relying on the internet. The reason I mention the 
4 internet is because when the autopsy report was, 
5 we've been waiting, the family has been waiting for 
6 the autopsy report and finally there was an 
7 announcement that the autopsy report had been 
8 released. And talked with the lawyer and said it 
9 wasn't released in the normal course, it was what he 
10 called leaked through the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
11 He sent it to me and I read it, you 
12 know, it looked good but it's still, as you said, 
13 I'm not going to rely on it as being the true thing 
14 unless I knew it was the true thing. And there were 
15 other things you mention that the clothing, for 
16 example, I saw the clothing. I examined the 
17 clothing, and the drops of blood on the clothing and 
18 sometimes we can find droplets of blood to be very 
19 useful in our examination and it showed that it was 
20 coming from above the pants and down to the floor 
21 and that the only thing I could find that would go 
22 along with it would be the cut in the hand.

4 before this episode is the best indicator of the 
5 affects of marijuana than what I'm raising, you

7 medical examiners always have to take other things 
8 into consideration. 
9 And the best example of that, the 
10 biggest obligation we have is to issue a death 
11 certificate. And the medical examiner, coroner's 
12 job that he's responsible for, he or she has to 
13 certify the name of the person through various 
14 means, make sure it is the right person on the death 
15 certificate. 
16 Cause of death and manner of death. 
17 Cause of death we find from the 
18 findings at autopsy, gunshot wounds, heart attack, 
19 cancer. The manner of death, natural, accident or 
20 suicide, we are always relying on other people's 
21 information. 
22 Falling out of the window, was he 
23 washing the window at that time depends on some 
24 other information that may or may not be reliable. 
25 So the manner of death, the accident, suicide,

4 A That's correct. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: And you know you testified 
6 that in your opinion the blood on the pants and the 
7 socks came from the hand because it came from above 
8 and dropped downward? 
9 
10 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Wouldn't you agree with me

12 traveled through the face, lacerated the eyebrow 
13 area, it ruptured his eyeball? 
14 A Yes. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: If he were in this 
16 position, blood could have spattered from that 
17 facial injury onto his shorts and socks; is that 
18 right? 
19 A It's possible in the seconds before he 
20 fell to the ground that could have happened, some of 
21 that could have happened, yes. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: You can't tell when those 
23 spatters happened, correct? 
24 A Other than there were lots of spatters,

2 have gotten that much blood on his pants and socks 
3 just from a bullet wound that enters the scalp, went 
4 through the eyeball, some blood can come out and 
5 collapses to the ground. If he was standing after 
6 that shot, then with his head bent over it could

1 car and his blood is on both on his pants and is 
2 like, yeah, it could have covered, following the 
3 injury to the hand in the car, yes. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So, I mean, you really 
5 can't conclude anything from the fact that other 
6 than the blood that was on his shorts and socks came 
7 from the body of Michael Brown and that they came 
8 after he had been injured by a gunshot wound. 
9 Injured with a gun, is that fair to say? 
10 A I think I agree with everything you say. 
11 I think also that the only way I could correlate it 
12 if it came from the hand, but that would be my 
13 opinion. It could come from any part of his body 
14 that was bleeding long enough for that blood to come 
15 out, yes, I agree with you. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And if there are witnesses 
17 that say when I saw him get shot they saw blood 
18 spray come off his head? 
19 
20 
A Yeah. 
MS. ALIZADEH: That could have caused the 
21 spatter that was on his socks and his pants? 
22 A Yeah, I think the witnesses saw blood 
23 spatter when the head was struck would be consistent 
24 with what happens when somebody's shot in the head 
25 with a bullet, but very little spatter occurs there

1 because blood could have come out, but it wouldn't 
2 cause all of the blood, it could cause some of the 
3 blood. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Go ahead. 
5 You did say that the hand 
6 wound, I guess because of the way it is superficial 
7 or the way the bullet would have hit it, it would 
8 have bled more? 
A Yes. 9 
10 
11 
Compared to the --
A To the bullet hole, yes. I think the 
12 issue that somebody brought up was even bullet holes 
13 quickly, the elasticity quickly closes up for a 
14 little bit, so you get some blood. You see it in a 
15 rapid camera that some blood comes out, not as much 
16 that comes out of the cut surface of the hand. 
17 Bullet wounds in the hand is, this one is like a cut 
18 wound, it didn't go in and seal up, it is a long 
19 graze so that a lot of blood vessels were exposed in 
20 the hand and caused bleeding. 
21 I have a question, I'm kind 
22 of curious about the original autopsy, so you did 
23 get a chance to see it? 
24 A I saw the photographs from the original 
25 autopsy. Most of these are the ones you looked at,

Page 107 
2 Did you ever see the report? 
3 A Then I saw recently the report, the 
4 autopsy report, yes. 
5 So how did the one that you 
6 said that was leaked, how did it compare to the 
7 original one that you saw. 
8 A It was the same, it was the same. The 
9 leaked autopsy report was the same as the final one, 
10 but as was brought up, it is not as reliable. 
11 Sometimes things get leaked and changes are made, 
12 but in this instance the leaked autopsy was the same 
13 as the official autopsy. 
14 I have two questions. We 
15 have heard testimony from two different agencies 
16 that have performed autopsies. We had St. Louis 
17 County and the Department of Justice or the 
18 Department of Defense. They both come in and go 
19 over their autopsies in great detail and their 
20 findings. Is there any reason that we should 
21 question the validity of those, of those findings? 
22 A Well, I think, I'm not sure. I know what 
23 I seen in the autopsy report from St. Louis County. 
24 I haven't seen anything about the federal autopsy 
25 report.

As far as I could see with the St. 
Louis County autopsy, the findings are the same. 
3 is the interpretation we get into that can differ 
4 depending on experience and other things. 
5 For example, whether or not the 
6 bullet wound in the clavicle or up by the shoulder 
7 by the collar bone is a reentry or not. As a 
It 
8 forensic, we can disagree forensically, doesn't make 
9 any difference in the scheme of things, except it 
10 ads a bullet that struck the body. 
11 So from my experience, I would 
12 interpret it as a reentry wound rather than an entry 
13 wound, but it really doesn't make any difference in 
14 the overall interpretation of what happened. 
15 I don't know if, I think as far as 
16 the toxicology goes, I think the issue that was 
17 brought up by the attorney was that there are 
18 toxicologists who are very good at finding 
19 toxicology, and an interpretation of how long the 
20 drugs last in the body. They are very good how long 
21 the drugs lasted in the body, for example. And that 
22 would have, uh, what do you call it, many more 
23 importance than a medical examiner's interpretation, 
24 but I think that the point you are in a position to 
25 do much more than we can is finding out his behavior

2 If marijuana has caused his behavior 
3 to be different than usual, that can best be 
4 determined by other observations by people that 
5 you've taken testimony from during the day and 
6 marijuana if I smoke it now, if I start acting 
7 bizarre it would be very quickly. 
8 You know, if I'm normal behavior for 
9 the next four hours, I'm not suddenly going to do 
10 something to act differently when the level of 
11 marijuana has gone down considerably, that's all. 
12 My second question is, we 
13 can agree you're a pretty high profile person, and 
14 you've been in the news and on the news and 
15 interviewed a lot, do you recall a conversation that 
16 you had with when you mentioned 
17 to her that the presence of marijuana in Michael 
18 Brown could have led him to act crazy was the actual 
19 word that you used? 
20 A I did say that, yes, it can, but it is 
21 unlikely. And the sentence we are talking about it 
22 would be right away and it is unusual, but it can in 
23 the whole spectrum. Most people wouldn't have too 
24 much affect on, some would have a very soothing 
25 affect, you know. Medical marijuana and things like

1 that can make people feel better who are dying of 
2 cancer and things like that, and some people can act 
3 very unusual and crazy, but that's very unusual. 
4 But I think you got it right. 
5 Thank you. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else? 
7 You know we have a copy of 
8 the Department of Defense and we have a copy of St. 
9 Louis County. I'm still baffled by what you see, I 
10 don't have anything that shows me in writing so we 
11 can compare what, what your findings are. So what 
12 are the differences? 
13 A Well, number one --
14 I mean, we are already after 
15 12. 
16 A That's okay. I know number one, that I'm 
17 giving you an opinion in great part depends on what 
18 I saw yesterday. I couldn't give an opinion, as I 
19 said a long time ago, until I saw the autopsy 
20 photographs, what the body looked like before the 
21 autopsy was done, you know, which these photographs 
22 that you see are all from that time, which are very 
23 significant.

1 particular opinions. 
2 As far as the autopsy, and then I 
3 will now write a report, but I couldn't write it 
4 yesterday, I will write a report on the basis of my 
5 finding. 
6 As far as I could see from the St. 
7 Louis report, I don't know the other report, we 
8 agree with everything except that reentry wound. 
9 You agree with everything 
10 except the reentry? 
11 A In the autopsy report is there, I don't 
12 know what the testimony has been, but is there 
13 something particular that you think --
14 No, and that is my question. 
15 My question is, you have made statements to the 
16 press about how your findings are different than 
17 ours and now--
A I have not made such statement. 18 
19 
20 
So the press is wrong? 
A Of course. I am told one thing, I'm told 
21 that the USA Today had an article about me. I have 
22 no idea what it said, but I find often, especially 
23 in forensic, that what they say they often 
24 misconstrue things. 
25 I know.

1 A So if you are referring to articles I 
2 haven't seen, I can't answer that. I'm telling you 
3 that the only thing I said to the press was 
4 initially, way at the very first day, I did the 
5 autopsy and the next day the family had a press 
6 conference. And I said as a basis of my findings, I 
7 find no evidence of powder on any of the gunshot 
8 wounds and that they were all distant, beyond one or 
9 two feet away at the time of discharge. 
10 Now, yesterday, I looked at slides, I 
11 looked at things and sure enough, I looked at 
12 pictures that one photo shows it nicely to me of the 
13 hand that there is powder and I indicated at the 
14 time you recall very careful to say that, these are 
15 preliminary, these are not my final opinions. And 
16 if I get more information, and essentially I didn't 
17 get that much information until yesterday, when I 
18 went through the thing, but I would think that yes, 
19 I was mistaken. There is powder, gunshot powder on 
20 the hand. 
21 But, and I think that the only thing 
22 that's different was whether we both agree that 
23 there was a gunshot wound in the back, one was in 
24 the back, the others were in the front, there is no 
25 difference.

1 The reason I ask that is 
2 because you did mention you got some of your 
3 information from the New York Times. I just wanted 
4 to point out for the record the information that we 
5 do get from the media can be skewed. There is very 
6 little that's correct about it. So I just wanted to 
7 make sure that you know. 
8 A You're absolutely right, but the 
9 information I get you see is different kind of 
10 information is a lot of turmoil in Ferguson, there 
11 are people making all kind of charges. That there's 
12 a problem with the interpretation, that's the 
13 information that I get. 
14 I don't get, I did say that if, in my 
15 opinion, if the leaked report that there's blood 
16 from Brown in the car, then that would be good 
17 evidence that his hand was in the car. Then that 
18 would be good evidence at the time he was bleeding, 
19 that kind of thing, if. But all the ifs canceled 
20 out when I see what the work was. I agree with you, 
21 what's in the newspapers are not reliable. 
22 Malarkey.

24 and the news media, if you haven't figured out, like 
25 to create problems. It isn't to say A, B and C,

1 everybody says A, Band C, that's not news. But to 
2 say he says A and he says Z, that sells newspapers. 
3 One other question and then 
4 I promise no more. Do you do every autopsy you are 
5 asked to perform for a family? 
6 A No, no. 
7 So what's the determining 
8 factor. 
9 A The most important factor is will the 
10 autopsy make a difference. Is it important, is it 
11 important, because often families want autopsies out 
12 of curiosity and that may be okay, but I wouldn't go 
13 out of the way to do such an option. I do about, I 
14 do many less, I'm asked to do lots of autopsies and 
15 I will do the autopsy where I think that an autopsy 
16 or re-autopsy would be significant for the family or 
17 for the society. 
18 When we do autopsies on homicides, we 
19 have two things, one is the family and two is 
20 society. Society has a right to know what happened 
21 to somebody who's murdered and how to prevent it or 
22 catch the bad guy to do it. So that we have both of 
23 those and sometimes that comes into conflict as the 
24 prosecutor said that sometimes telling the family, 
25 which is important, comes in contact with the
