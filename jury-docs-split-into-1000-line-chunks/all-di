2 A He was just looking like he was, he had 
3 opened the door and was trying to get out of the 
4 car. I didn't know what was going on, I figure he 
5 might have been disoriented. I don't know what was 
6 going on, I couldn't tell you what was happening. 
7 All I know is he looked like he was coming out of 
8 the car and he got up and yeah, he did close the 
9 door behind him and he took off running. All right. 
10 Did you 
11 ever see anybody else by the car? 
12 A No. The only other people that I was 
13 looking, I seen were pretty much just bystanders and 
14 watching everything.

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let's see, Monday, 
Page 5 
6 October 13th, at 8:38 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh 
7 with the prosecutor's office, present is Sheila 
8 Whirley, all 12 grand jurors are present, as is 
9 , the court reporter. He's taking down what is 
10 being said and recording, audio recording. 
11 So for today, the first witness, let me 
12 back up a little bit and talk about scheduling. 
13 There was a question brought up, I think it might 
14 have been during a break we had last week about 
15 whether or not three days a week was helpful or if 
16 it was not very productive. And so Sheila and I 
17 have talked about it, as well as with some of our 
18 investigators. 
19 You know, as I mentioned to you that some 
20 of these people are reluctant to come in and that 
21 means going out and serving them subpoenas and even 
22 then, that's not a guarantee they're going to show 
23 up. 
24 We have been lucky so far. We have been 
25 able to get the people in, but, you know, every day

1 is going to be a challenge. We talked about it and 
2 first of all we felt that it was, it was going to be 
3 problematic for us to try to corral or wrangle up 
4 enough people to fill three days of your time. 
5 Neither Sheila nor I wants you sitting 
6 here. I know you have taken out from your personal 
7 lives and from your jobs and it is just really wrong 
8 for us to waste your time for you to sit here for 
9 two hours when we don't have anything scheduled for 
10 you or anything to put on. 
11 I think the two day a week is going to be 
12 better, hopefully we will use that time 
13 productively. 
14 Another reason for it is because we have 
15 doing the transcripts and we need those done 
16 as quickly as possible, because there's another 
17 investigation going on, that as you know, there's a 
18 federal investigation that's kind of parallel to 
19 ours. And doesn't just work when he's in the 
20 room with us, he goes home and he works to try to 
21 transcribe everything that is going on. And news to 
22 me, he mentioned the other day one hour of testimony 
23 may take him three hours to transcribe. 
24 He's working diligently to try to get 
25 these transcripts out. And when we have back to

1 back days, he's not able to work on the transcripts 
2 and the three days a week, we're finding he's not 
3 able to keep up with the transcripts the way we need 
4 them. 
5 Another reason is, you know, once this 
6 case is concluded and given to you for your 
7 deliberation, once, assuming you arrive at a 
8 decision, we don't want to have to delay that 
9 decision for two or three weeks while we're waiting 
10 for the transcripts to be done. 
11 So he's, , trying to do those as we 
12 go so we can keep up on those. So we felt that that 
13 was another reason why the two day a week would be 
14 better for just our purposes and getting this done 
15 efficiently and as quickly as possible. 
16 So I think the word went out to you last 
17 week after we canceled Thursday, that we also are 
18 canceling tomorrow, but we do have witnesses lined 
19 up for all day today, assuming they show up and then 
20 we have witnesses lined up for all day Thursday. 
21 Including, you know, we're going to hear statements 
22 when we're not having witnesses boom, boom, boom 
23 there will be times that you are listening to 
24 statements of witnesses that we anticipate that are 
25 going to be called.

1 So with that being said, thank you for, 
2 did they already do the rest of October? 
3 MS. WHIRLEY: How far, the 16th? 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Today, this week is today 
5 and Thursday. I don't know if we have the next two 
6 weeks actually written in stone. So if you guys, 
7 I've got a calendar in my office, but is that 
8 completed for the month. 
9 No jury duty on the 30th. 
10 We have it up through the 28th, that's three days. 
11 We need to talk about it. 
12 We need to confirm it. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah, why don't you all 
14 keep in mind two days a week is going to be the best 
15 way to go during your lunch break, and something you 
16 can kind of talk about your schedules and redo the 
17 calendar as you have. 
18 I will tell you that whatever days you 
19 pick, like I said, we are going to work with those. 
20 Doesn't matter to me, however, I do believe that it 
21 can be helpful for us if at least one of those days 
22 at least till 5:00. We've found that there are 
23 witnesses who have said, you know, well, I can't be 
24 here till 4:00 because my kids off the bus and blah, 
25 blah, blah.

1 We understand that these people are 
2 witnesses, you know. They happen to be, what they 
3 may feel now is at the wrong place at the wrong 
4 time. So, I'm trying my best, especially the ones 
5 that are cooperative, to work with them if they 
6 have, you know, work or child issues that, you know, 
7 we'll get you here, when does your son get off the 
8 bus. Okay. How about if we have the cab pick you 
9 up at 3:00, get you here at 3:30 that way we can get 
10 some of these people on. 
11 So when you do your schedule, I know that 
12 a lot of these days you have a 2:30 cutoff because 
13 of work and that's fine, but if there is a day 
14 during the week that you can go till 5:00, that 
15 might be a good second day for us because then we 
16 can maybe accommodate some witnesses that need to 
17 work later. 
18 Is there anything else that anybody had to 
19 bring up or talk about before we get started? 
20 All right. So today we are going to hear 
21 first We heard from his wife 
22 last Tuesday. And he was here 
23 with her, we didn't have time to get to him. You've 
24 already heard his recorded statement so we will call 
25 him as our first witness.

, she has a 
2 couple of statements that we will play before she 
3 testifies. One of them is very brief, like three 
4 minutes long, but the other one I have to tell you 
5 we just got because it was the result of a federal 
6 interview. 
7 I can't remember if it was done by the FBI 
8 or Department of Justice, but we have that, we have 
9 the recording of that, but I don't have a transcript 
10 of that. So we'll just listen to the recording of 
11 that statement before she testifies.

13 scheduled to be here at 1:00 in the afternoon. His 
14 name is He's made a number of

15 and a large black man, about my size, who appeared
