9 you believe this, then this. But we're going to 
10 give you what the law says when a law officer can 
11 use force to affect an arrest and when that force 
12 can be deadly. And then also when a person can use 
13 force to defend themselves and when that force can 
14 be deadly. 
15 There 1s all kind of things about whether 
16 or not the person is an initial aggressor, you know. 
17 And under the law, a law enforcement officer can be 
18 an initial aggressor, unless his arrest is unlawful. 
19 So there is all kind of things that go into that 
20 that I don't think he can answer those questions. 
21 GRAND JUROR: As long as we are going to 
22 get those guidelines. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: You will get definitions 
24 also and you apply the facts as you know them to the 
25 law.

Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: Just in case you don't come 
2 back, I need this for me. When starting your 
3 investigation after you already interviewed Officer 
4 Wilson, okay. You heard A of the story, there's A 
5 and B, but B is deceased. 
6 
7 
A Correct. 
GRAND JUROR: My question is, you heard 
8 his testimony, starting your investigation, you have 
9 A in your mind and then you go interview all of the 
10 other witnesses. When B doesn't have a voice, you 
11 don't make that your main concern during your 
12 investigation, I'm asking you as a police officer or 
13 a detective. 
14 
15 
A Okay. What's the question? 
GRAND JUROR: So the question 1s, Officer 
16 Wilson's testimony told you his scenario what 
17 happened. Of course Mike Brown cannot speak. 
18 A Right. 
19 GRAND JUROR: You only have what part A 
20 said, you don't have part B. So going off what he 
21 said and you are starting your investigation, that's 
22 your focus point, so do you like try to put 
23 everybody's investigation towards part A or you 
24 trying to put this scenario together? 
25 A Absolutely not. Do I try to put 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 109 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 everyone's toward part A as you made reference? In 
2 the initial phases of an investigation, it's simply 
3 to, I'm summarizing it here. 
4 
5 A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
It is simply to find as many witnesses as 
6 we can and gather the facts. There is no skewing to 
7 one side or to the other. It's essentially locate 
8 witnesses, obtain their statements from them, and it 
9 is to gather the evidence at the scene. 
10 And then in this particular instance, 
11 right, I present it to you, ladies and gentlemen of 
12 the grand jury, and you can make the decisions from 
13 there. But there is no skewing one side either way, 
14 okay. 
15 
16 
GRAND JUROR: 
GRAND JUROR: 
Thank you. 
One last question. In your 
17 eight years as a detective, have you ever had to 
18 arrest a police officer? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
A 
I have, yes, several times. 
GRAND JUROR: Can you g1ve one example? 
I've, well, this year I arrested a St. 
22 Louis County police officer for an assault. 
23 Several years ago I arrested a city 
24 police officer for an assault. I've conducted other 
25 investigations into police officers where they have 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 110 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 been arrested for a sex cr1me. Those are the three 
2 that are popp1ng up right now. I'm confident there 
3 are a few others one. 
4 
5 
6 
or they 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Assault, domestic assaults 
One was an on duty assault that took place 
7 at a MetroLink station and the incident was captured 
8 on video. The other one was an assault that took 
9 place, the officer was in uniform and he was at his 
10 station, he was getting off duty or had just gotten 
11 off duty and he assaulted several individuals and so 
12 obviously, both of those individuals I arrested. 
13 
14 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
And really, he won't be going far. If 
15 after lunch you think of something else you need to 
16 ask him to call him back, we're not going to start 
17 deliberations right now. So we'll conclude for 
18 lunch at this time. 
19 (Lunch recess taken) 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley, it 
21 1s November 21st, I'm not sure of the time, it is 
22 after 1:14 or so. I did reach regarding 
23 his report and he advised me that his report would 
24 be more complete and detailed, and that he could 
25 have it to us by noon on Monday. I asked him what 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 111 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 would be different, you know, or significant, and he 
2 said that he would be able, he can derive from the 
3 photos that he viewed once he was here the bullet 
4 trajectory and the position that the body was in 
5 when it was shot. 
6 When he was here, he basically answered 
7 our questions, but a report, when he would sit down 
8 and write a report it would be more comprehensive 
9 and detailed. 
10 He said he didn't realize, he hadn't 
11 started working on it, he didn't realize he could 
12 submit one after his testimony, but he could work on 
13 it and have it ready by Monday noon, before noon. 
14 With that 1n mind, I know you didn't g1ve us your 
15 answer as to what you had decided about the report, 
16 what do you think, do you want the report? 
17 
18 
MS. ALIZADEH: Tell them the other option. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I thought we would go to the 
19 other option if they don't want the report. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: They should know all of 
21 their options. 
22 GRAND JUROR: If I'm hearing you right, 1n 
23 his report is he saying that based on the trajectory 
24 of the bullets he is going to show a diagram of 
25 positioning of the body that resulted in those 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 112 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 injuries? 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: I didn't go into detail 
3 questioning of him, and that's where the other 
4 option comes in and we will talk about that in a 
5 minute, but what he said basically is his report 
6 will talk about the trajectory of the bullets and 
7 what position the body was in when it was shot based 
8 on his findings. 
9 Now, the other option 1s, as Kathi was 
10 suggesting, I could find out if you want to ask him 
11 a question, like you had a pretty detailed question 
12 right then, I could try and reach him again and see 
13 if he 1s available, maybe we could do a conference 
14 call and you can ask him some questions about what 
15 his report would say that he didn't talk about here 
16 or how it may differ or how it is more complete. 
17 Was there another option? I think those were the 
18 two options. Am I missing one? 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: The options are continue 
20 without the report or without a conference call. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: That's the third option. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: Or let's just wait for the 
23 report on Monday at noon, or let's get him on a 
24 conference call and see if he can explain to us what 
25 might be in his report that he didn't testify to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 113 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 when he was here, or we need to have him back live 
2 and in person for you all to question him in person. 
3 I'm not suggesting any of these. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, it lS up to you. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: These are all your 
6 decisions. Sheila is the one who talked to him 
7 that's why I told her, tell him what you said. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: That's what he basically 
9 said. 
10 GRAND JUROR: He said that he could tell, 
11 hit report is going to be tell us what position the 
12 body was in when he was shot. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: He's going to be g1v1ng an 
14 op1n1on 1s my understanding is, he wasn't there. 
15 A That's different than what he said when he 
16 was here, so if that's the case, then I think we 
17 
18 
need to wait until we have the report. 
GRAND JUROR: What he said, 1s a 
19 pr1ma dona. How much time he need to do a report, a 
20 final report. Every time he says something, he 
21 change his mind, I'm sorry, but to me he's a pr1ma 
22 dona. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: This discussion you should 
24 all have by yourself and off the record. Here is 
25 the thing, and this is one thing that, I wasn't part 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 114 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 of the call, Sheila was. I'm asking her some of 
2 these questions because I asked her, now, I'm 
3 cross-exam1n1ng Sheila. 
4 
5 
MS. WHIRLEY: Not go1ng to happen. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Is he going to say 
6 something different than what he testified to? 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: And my understanding 1s, no, 
8 not necessarily different, unless that's a 
9 conclusion you may come up with. It is basically a 
10 more detailed and complete report regarding the 
11 trajectory of the bullets and the position that the 
12 body was in when it was shot. 
13 If you all recall something different that 
14 he said when he testified, I'm not suggesting that 
15 you are, but that's, you know, for you to decide. 
16 He basically said that his report would be about his 
17 findings, I'm repeating it, this is verbatim, the 
18 trajectory of the bullets and the position of the 
19 body when he was shot. I didn't question him any 
20 further than that. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: So we have the evidence all 
22 set up in the room for you. First of all, do you 
23 need me to call back to answer any 
24 further questions at this time? No, okay. 
25 Now, you all asked about the duty belt, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 115 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 which we do have 1n evidence and you will be able to 
2 see it, but I have the photographs of it when the 
3 duty belt was seized, and it looks like this was 
4 seized by Detective , who you have already 
5 heard from. 
6 So I will let you look at those and I'll 
7 mark the envelope that contains those photos. There 
8 are s1x 1mages, Grand Jury Exhibit 107. 
9 (Grand jury Exhibit Number 107 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Obviously we had some 
12 matters during the lunch hour that kind of kept me 
13 busy with things. I did try to look for that 
14 Quantico report about the gunshots that you hear. 
15 And I know I have it, I haven't had really time to 
16 search through my stuff for it. So while you are 
17 looking at evidence, I will try to lay my hands on 
18 that as well. 
19 You want to hear the interview of 
20 
21 
before you go look at the evidence? Yes. 
So, can you tell me, can I look at my 
22 little chart. 
23 (Playing of the interview of

18 and then I would need to send him a video. I didn't 
19 when somebody talking to you (inaudible.) Then I 
20 send the video, the video I heard more.

Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 THE WITNESS: He wasn't there. And then I 
2 remember him asking me is it okay to come in the 
3 doors and he eventually came. 
4 THE FBI: Okay. I think the other p1ece 
5 of information that you wanted to tell us about was 
6 a video recorder that was removed, video camera that 
7 was removed. Can you tell me a little bit about 
8 that? 
9 THE WITNESS: That came into my mind when 
10 I spoke, another eyewitness who was g1v1ng me 
11 details of the entire thing. 
12 THE FBI: Who was that that you are 
13 talking to? 
14 THE WITNESS: The eyewitness, 
15 telling me that.

3 about this incident, the shooting of Michael 
4 Brown? 
5 
6 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
THE FBI: And it sparked something 1n your 
7 head about cameras or? 
8 THE WITNESS: Well, I was just trying to 
9 get information or details about what happened. 
10 
11 
THE FBI: Okay. 
THE WITNESS: Since I live in the 
12 community I was just curious what happened. 
13

20 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
THE FBI: You didn't see the camera 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: Okay. Do you know which camera 
21 it was, did she tell you? 
22 THE WITNESS: No. 
23 THE FBI: Well, then that's something we 
24 can follow-up with her since you don't have any 
25 independent knowledge of that camera, it 1s 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 126 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 something that she has the knowledge of which camera 
2 and who removed it from where it was? 
3 THE WITNESS: Right. 
4 THE FBI: Was there anything else in the 
5 shooting of Michael Brown that would be helpful for 
6 us? 
7 
8 anything. 
9 
THE WITNESS: No, I can't think of 
THE FBI: I asked you before about whether 
10 you would be willing to share the video that you 
11 showed to us today, is that something you are 
12 willing to share with us? 
13 
14 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
THE FBI: We will go ahead and have you 
15 s1gn a form that allows, you know, gives us 
16 authorization to take that off your phone and take a 
17 copy of that directly off your phone. 
18 Okay. Anything else? 
19 I don't want to get into what she told 
20 you, what you talked with her. Do you have any 
21 information, a way to contact her? 
22 
23 
24 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: You don't. 
THE WITNESS: I mean, well, she has a 
25 sister that I talk to, so her sister. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 127 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 THE FBI: What's her sister's name? Is 
2 there a cell phone number we can reach her at? 
3 THE WITNESS: 
4 
5 
6 
7 
THE FBI: What's 's last name. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I don't know her last name. 
THE FBI: Okay. Do you have a number for 
? s sister 1s the one who supposedly 
8 saw what happened? 
9 THE WITNESS: 's sister 1s the one 
10 who lives in the apartment complex. 
11 THE FBI: Do you know where she lives at 
12 1n the apartment complex? 
13 THE WITNESS: doesn't live 1n 
14 apartment complex, does. Okay. 
15 THE FBI: Again, was the one 
16 telling you about this camera? 
17 THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
18 
19 
20 
roommate 
THE FBI: Did you talk to, your other 
wasn't there, but your roommate 
, did you talk to that roommate, did that 
21 roommate, did she see anything, was she outside? 
22 
23 
24 
25 
THE WITNESS: No, she was inside. 
THE FBI: She was inside. 
THE WITNESS: She was inside. 
THE FBI: So she may have heard something, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 128 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 she was not outside to be able to see anything. 
2 
3 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
THE FBI: Okay. Again, any other 
4 questions? 
5 
6 
7 
Do you have s address? 
THE WITNESS: No. 
THE FBI: Okay. All right. The time is 
8 now 7:26, we'll go ahead and stop the recording. 
9 (End of the recorded interview.) 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Is that the only thing that 
11 we're listening to? 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS Kathi Alizadeh, we 
13 just played off of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 49, 
14 which is a disc, we just played a statement from 
15 , which was recorded by the FBI 
16 previously, previous to his testimony before this 
17 grand Jury. 
18 Are there any other recorded statements 
19 that I indicated to you that we have available? 
20 Just for the record's sake, as well as for y'all to 
21 know, on that list I should indicate what exhibit 
22 the statements are on. So if at any time, even 
23 during your deliberations you want to hear it, I can 
24 play it for you. 
25 Sheila and I talked about the fact that if 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 129 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you want to listen to a witness' statement on a disc 
2 where there are multiple statements, probably if you 
3 can ask us to go ahead and cue it up. We can leave 
4 the room if you want to be alone and talk while its 
5 playing, there is a lot of people's statements on 
6 there that didn't get played because they say they 
7 didn't know anything or what have you. 
8 And then, but I will tell you statements 
9 that I did not have previously that I since have 
10 gotten. This is the statement of which 
11 was done, it is a two and a half hour statement that 
12 was done the night before he testified, and I've 
13 marked that as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 109. 
14 This is a disc that has a statement of 
15 that was done by the FBI on 
16 September 2nd of 2014. I didn't have that 
17 previously, that's Grand Jury Exhibit 108. And a 
18 recorded statement of that was done 
19 the day before she testified for you guys and that's 
20 Grand Jury Exhibit 110. 
21 So all of the statements that I've 
22 indicated that you have not heard you either have 
23 the transcripts for or I have them on disc for you 
24 to listen to whenever you need to, all right. 
25 With that being said. Any other 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 130 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 statements you want to listen to? You just let me 
2 know. 
3 At this point let's go ahead and take our 
4 break for y'all to take a bathroom break if you want 
5 and then reassemble here and then we will go look at 
6 the evidence in the room, 1s that all right? And 
7 then you guys can let us know what your decision is 
8 about 's report. 
9 (Recess) 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: It is November 21st, 
11 2:47p.m. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And my understanding is 
13 you're ready to get instruction on the law so that 
14 you can begin your deliberation. You've also made a 
15 decision you asked us to check on the report, 
16 autopsy report by I checked on it, I 
17 reported back and he said it was not ready, but he 
18 could have it ready by noon, which 1s on the east 
19 coast is my understanding, by noon on Monday. My 
20 understanding is you have agreed that you will wait 
21 for that report before turning in your decision; is 
22 that correct? Yes. However, you want to begin your 
23 deliberations now, correct? 
24 (Jurors indicate yes.) 
25 MS. WHIRLEY: We have prepared the law for 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 131 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you, we have prepared the relevant statutes, and 
2 Kathi is going to grab the indictments, they are 
3 ready. We just need to bring them in here and I'll 
4 pass this around. 
5 We have kind of reduced down the statute 
6 so that it is applicable to this case and easier to 
7 understand and read. Of course, if you have any 
8 questions along the way you can ask us by knocking 
9 on the door or ringing the bell. I guess r1ng1ng 
10 the bell would be better. And definitions that you 
11 think are applicable to the statutes. 
12 So we're going to the statutes, and will 
13 g1ve the foreperson the indictments and I will pick 
14 up the extras. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: So the indictments that we 
16 have prepared there 1s an indictment for murder 1n 
17 the first degree, a Class A felony and armed 
18 criminal action and unclassified felony, there 1s 
19 two cop1es. 
20 There 1s indictment for murder in the 
21 second degree and armed criminal, two cop1es. 
22 An indictment for voluntary manslaughter, 
23 a Class B felony, and armed criminal action, two 
24 COpleS. 
25 An indictment for involuntary manslaughter 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 132 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 in the first degree and armed criminal action, two 
2 COpleS. 
3 And involuntary manslaughter in the second 
4 degree and armed criminal action, two copies. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: The relevant statute it 
6 pretty much lays out the elements of the crimes that 
7 you have indictments for. It also has definitions 
8 that might be applicable to the crimes that are laid 
9 out in the statutes that you are looking at, it 1s 
10 not a statute, it is an indictment. 
11 
12 
The standard of proof is probable cause, 
we did confirm that. So you guys, that is what you 
13 have been working with probable cause all along 
14 s1nce you have been grand jurors and that doesn't 
15 change. Even though this has been a very long, 
16 arduous task going through this evidence. Your 
17 standard of proof is still probable cause. You're 
18 not here to determine guilt or not guilty, it 1s 
19 probable cause, is it enough to go to trial. 
20 Now, what makes this a little bit 
21 different is that if you will look on page, the 
22 first page, it talks about assault of a law 
23 enforcement officer in the first degree. And that's 
24 part of the indictment because the officer is say1ng 
25 he was arresting him for assaulting him. So that's 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 133 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 what you would be considering 1n your deliberation 
2 and we have provided you with definitions of assault 
3 1n the first degree, on the second page 1s assault 
4 1n the second degree and the third degree. And then 
5 also a law enforcement officer's use of force in 
6 making an arrest. An officer can use force in 
7 making an arrest, got that laid out for you. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Real quick, can I interrupt 
9 about something? 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Sure. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Previously 1n the very 
12 beginning of this process I printed out a statute 
13 for you that was, the statute in Missouri for the 
14 use of force to affect an arrest. 
15 So if you all want to get those out. What 
16 we have discovered, and we have been going along 
17 with this, doing our research, is that the statute 
18 in the State of Missouri does not comply with the 
19 case law. 
20 This doesn't sound probably unfamiliar to 
21 you that the law is codified in a written form 1n 
22 books and they're called statutes, but courts' 
23 interpret those statutes. And so the statute for 
24 the use of force to affect an arrest in the State of 
25 Missouri does not comply with Missouri Supreme, I'm 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 134 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 sorry, United States Supreme Court cases. 
2 And so what Sheila has come up with 1s a 
3 statement of the law as to when an officer can use 
4 force to affect an arrest, that does track our 
5 Missouri Statute, but also takes into consideration 
6 what the Supreme Court says, okay. 
7 So the statute I gave you, if you want to 
8 fold that 1n half just so that you know don't 
9 necessarily rely on that because there is a portion 
10 of that that doesn't comply with the law. And then 
11 the thing that Sheila is giving you, that statement 
12 about use of force to affect an arrest, I don't know 
13 is that what you called it, is that the title. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Law enforcement officers use 
15 of force in making an arrest, yes. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: That does correctly state 
17 what the law is on when an officer can use force and 
18 when he can use deadly force in affecting an arrest, 
19 okay. 
20 I don't want you to get confused and don't 
21 rely on that copy or that print-out of the statute 
22 that I've given you a long time ago. 
23 
24 
25 
MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have a question? 
GRAND JUROR: So we're to disregard this. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is not entirely 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 135 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 incorrect or inaccurate, but there is something 1n 
2 it that's not correct, 1gnore it totally. 
3 GRAND JUROR: It is because of the 
4 federal? 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: Of a Supreme Court case and 
6 we must follow Supreme Court of the United States. 
7 It is Tennessee v. Garner, not that that matters 
8 much to you. 
9 GRAND JUROR: The Supreme Court, federal 
10 Supreme Court overrides Missouri statutes. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: As far as you need to know, 
12 just don't worry about that. 
13 
14 
15 statute. 
16 
17 law class. 
GRAND JUROR: All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Just disregard that 
MS. WHIRLEY: We don't want to get into a 
18 That's that one and 1s that all you want 
19 to say on that? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah, I wanted to point 
21 that out. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: Use of force and defense of 
23 a person, and we've added use of force and it is 
24 actually, I'm sorry, we consider it a self-defense 
25 instruction. So the first one is self-defense as it 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 136 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 relates to the information that you may have heard 
2 regarding Michael Brown. 
3 The second one 1s self-defense as it 
4 relates to the law enforcement officer. As you 
5 deliberate and looked at the indictment, if you have 
6 questions about definitions, again, we have provided 
7 definitions, so just refer to that sheet that you 
8 have. And then also, probable cause is the 
9 standard, but Kathi, something she added that, you 
10 know, I need to tell you unless you want to do it, I 
11 can do it. 
12 
13 
MS. ALIZADEH: No, you do it. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is that in order to vote 
14 true bill, you also must consider whether you 
15 believe Darren Wilson, you find probable cause, 
16 that's the standard to believe that Darren Wilson 
17 committed the offense and the offenses are what is 
18 1n the indictment and you must find probable cause 
19 to believe that Darren Wilson did not act in lawful 
20 self-defense, and you've got the last sheet talks 
21 about self-defense and talks about officer's use of 
22 force, because then you must also have probable 
23 cause to believe that Darren Wilson did not use 
24 lawful force in making an arrest. So you are 
25 considering self-defense and use of force in making 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 137 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 an arrest. 
2 You have all the information you need in 
3 those documents that we gave you to help in your 
4 deliberation. But again, if you have additional 
5 questions, we're here, we're not going anywhere, did 
6 you have something? 
7 
8 
GRAND JUROR: No. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And that's enough to get you 
9 started and hopefully this will clarify things for 
10 you as you go through the indictments. And I think 
11 we have already talked about, you'll decide how you 
12 want to go through the indictments if you want to 
13 look at them one at a time, but you must make a 
14 decision whether it is true bill or no true bill for 
15 each indictment. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And as was brought up at 
17 the very beginning of this and what we have 
18 researched and discussed, the possibility of well, 
19 what if there's, you know, five people want to 
20 indict on murder first and five people that want to 
21 indict on murder second, and two people that don't 
22 want to indict. If you have nine people that vote 
23 indict on anything, then there will be an 
24 indictment. What that indictment is we will deal 
25 with if that happens, but there was some question, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 138 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 well, 1s it kind of like a hung Jury if we all can't 
2 agree on the charge. No. 
3 If there are n1ne people to vote for an 
4 indictment, regardless of what charge you are 
5 indicting on, then know that there will be an 
6 indictment and we will give you further instruction 
7 on what that indictment, what offense it will be. 
8 And the one thing that Sheila has 
9 explained as far as what you must find and as she 
10 said, it is kind of in Missouri it is kind of, the 
11 State has to prove 1n a criminal trial, the State 
12 has to prove that the person did not act 1n lawful 
13 self-defense or did not use lawful force 1n making, 
14 it is kind of like we have to prove the negative. 
15 So in this case because we are talking 
16 about probable cause, as we've discussed, you must 
17 find probable cause to believe that he committed the 
18 offense that you're considering and you must find 
19 probable cause to believe that he did not act in 
20 lawful self-defense. Not that he did, but that he 
21 did not and that you find probable cause to believe 
22 that he did not use lawful force in making the 
23 arrest. 
24 So if you guys need clarification on that
