3 A Oh, you will see this in a couple other 
4 ones, that is a cigarette butt. On the street in a 
5 couple images that you will see and a couple more 
6 slides, you will see other cigarette butts within 
7 the scene. Those were deemed as not evidentiary, 
8 they were cigarette butts and trash that litter this

1 you were interrupted what you had been doing, what 
2 event had transpired? 
3 A At this point after the body had moved, we 
4 had learned the information of how many rounds he 
5 had fired, which were 12. We had found ten shell 
6 casings and we were continuing to look at the 
7 eastern end of the crime scene where the body was 
8 at. We were looking around the western end where 
9 the vehicle was at, unknown how many shots were 
10 fired at which location. 
11 The vehicle was getting ready to be 
12 towed and to save us time spent here closing down 
13 this entire apartment complex, we were trying to 
14 determine if possibly the shell casings were inside 
15 of his police car because we hadn't been in to 
16 search it yet because we had made the determination 
17 to tow it and process it at our lab, but that could 
18 take a couple of hours from start to finish. In the 
19 meantime we could be searching for two casings that 
20 just left our crime scene. 
21 So I talked with the detective that 
22 was going to process his car and we, not quickly, 
23 but we briefly opened the door where I photographed 
24 the hole that corresponds with the dent on the 
25 outside of the door and then we went through just

13 Somebody else will testify about what it Q

We had already identified, located this 
17 spatter prior to the second round of gunshots. 
18 Image 126. Intermediate view of the 
19 spatter pattern and clarifying this end of this 
20 pattern would be closest to Michael Brown, this 
21 would be the farthest part. 
22 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) But Michael Brown's body 
23 is in between the blood spatter and Darren Wilson's 
24 vehicle?

Yes, ma'am.

1 Q So blood spatter is farther east from the 
2 body? 
3 A Yes. These two spatter patterns are the 
4 farthest east evidence that we located. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
All right. 
Image 127. Same thing, directly overhead 
7 view with additional scale laid in for analysis 
8 purposes. 
9 Image 128. At this point I think 
10 this would be an intermediate view of the same 
11 spatter pattern. Again, with more than one scale to 
12 assist experts in size and shape. 
13 Image 129. Similar photos before, 
14 different orientation of the camera. 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
And so the placard and that scale? 
Has not moved since the previous photo. 
17 Basically the photo before, if you can picture I'm 
18 standing facing directly west, now I've oriented 
19 myself where I'm facing south and the placards are 
20 still in the same direction. 
21 Image Number 130. At this point I 
22 have switched camera lenses to what we will refer to 
23 as a prime lens. The lens I typically use for 
24 overall photos is 18 to 35, kind of a wide angle 
25 lens. I switched to a 60 millimeter lens, which is

1 a fixed focal. It is something where you can get 
2 close-up images of something with great detail. It 
3 doesn't zoom in or zoom out, it only focuses at 
4 fixed length. It can focus in really close to small 
5 objects to find greater detail. 
6 Q And although you can't see the placard 
7 clearly, that's number 19? 
8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am, still number 19. 
All right. 
Image 131. Again, the overhead projector 
11 isn't showing a lot of detail, but this is just a 
12 close-up image of number 19 still, and I'm focusing 
13 on the scale to show, an analyst would describe as a 
14 tail of the red spatter pattern. 
15 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
And that's also 19? 
Still 19, yes, ma'am. 
Image Number 132. Now we've moved 
18 back to image, I would have to go back to the 
19 overall one first, number 20 is an overall position. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
You want to look at your diagram? 
I need to see the overall of the two 
22 placards together. Number 20, in the overall. Can 
23 I put this back up? 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Sure, but say the photo number. 
I'm going to put Image Number 124 back up

1 just to show you the orientation of the placard. 
2 Again, the corner arm of the placard is facing back 
3 towards Michael Brown's body and Darren Wilson's 
4 police car. 
5 Now, going to Image 132, so this 
6 pointer arm of the placard is facing west. I'm 
7 standing on the north side of the road looking south 
8 to take this photograph. 
9 Image 133. Intermediate view again. 
10 The placard is facing west again looking at this red 
11 stain pattern. 
12 Image 134. Again, evidence item 
13 number 20, red stain pattern still standing on the 
14 north side of it looking south. 
15 Image 135. Same perspective, I've 
16 now added a second scale to reference size and 
17 shape. 
18 Image 136. Again, here I switched 
19 back again to my macro lens or my prime lens to show 
20 up close and with greater detail the tailing pattern 
21 of the spatter. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
And that's item number 20? 
Still item number 20, yes. Image 137. 
24 Still on evidence item number 20. Again, another 
25 photo, same reference as before.

1 Image 138. Still evidence item 20, 
2 yet closer view of a tail. 
3 Image 139. Scale in the previous 
4 photo, this scale was referenced this direction. I 
5 moved the placard out of the way and referenced this 
6 scale to the bottom of it to give you a reference 
7 point. This is on the, this is the eastern end, 
8 this up would be the north, I'm sorry, to the west 
9 back towards Michael Brown's body. 
10 Q Okay. Now, regarding these two red 
11 stains, 19 and 20, did you seize them and package 
12 them? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes, I seized a sample of them. 
Was it in a similar, same method that you 
15 described seizing the red stain on the side of the 
16 vehicle? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. Sterile Q-Tip with sterile 
18 water and then put into its own individual packaging 
19 box. 
20 Q 
21 19 and 20? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
And those are still labeled items number 
Yes, ma'am, sample of item 19 and 20. 
So in this case, you didn't consume the 
24 whole stain? 
25 A

1 Q-Tip. 
2 Q And you know you don't need more than a 
3 small amount for testing purposes? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Image Number 140. Basically this is 
6 a photograph showing how I have reorientated the 
7 scale that you saw in the previous picture. This 
8 way, I'm sorry, again you can see the placard for 
9 19, which is this other splatter pattern, and 18 is 
10 a placard for a piece of evidence that had already 
11 been collected, but the placard is still in place. 
12 Q Item Number 18 would have been listed on 
13 your diagram as to what that was? 
14 A Yes, ma'am, I believe item 18 was another 
15 spent Federal shell casing. 
16 Image 141. Same thing as before, it 
17 is another image showing how I moved the orientation 
18 of that scale reference item 20. 
19 Image 142. Just like with the 
20 previous scale of photos, I go from my intermediate, 
21 my overall, to my intermediate, again, this would be 
22 the intermediate showing the new reference point or 
23 orientation of the scale. 
24 Item 143. This is a photograph,

1 photograph with the scale below, the photograph 
2 here. It did not show up in the frame. 
3 Q And this is item 20 still? 
4 A Yes, still item number 20. 
5 Image 144. The same shot as before 
6 with the scale in the frame. 
7 Image 145. This image shows several 
8 things. This is the overall image of evidence items 
9 21 and 22, which we found and you will see in the 
10 next few photographs, the final two shell casings to 
11 get to 12 shell casings. The first thing you will 
12 see in this image number one is the Ferguson car is 
13 still here, we have pushed the crime scene back at 
14 this point in time. Here again is the pile of tarps 
15 and sheets that we used to shield the view of the 
16 public. You can also see these are evidence 
17 placards for 11 and 12. Those are other shell 
18 casings that we found previously and had already 
19 collected. 
20 This is the end of our, towards the 
21 end of my investigation here for physical evidence 
22 and it shows that we never stop in the order that we 
23 find them. Obviously, 11 and 12 wouldn't 
24 necessarily be next to 21 and 22, with 15 being over 
25 here. It is just the order we found it at. The
