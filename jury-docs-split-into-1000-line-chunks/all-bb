7 but not all the cones had been placed out yet. 
8 Q Okay. And I asked you if you noticed were 
9 there any civilian vehicles, I know it is an 
10 apartment complex and there is parking lots, but I'm 
11 talking about in the street itself. Were there any 
12 civilian vehicles that were stopped in the street 
13 when you arrived? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Did you notice any pedestrians, civilians 
16 that were on foot in the area? 
17 A There were several pedestrians about the 
18 area. 
19 Q When you say several, when you first 
20 arrived, give me an idea how many you think, an 
21 estimate how many you would say at the scene? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
I'd say 10 to 15. 
Okay. Now, we've heard that there was 
24 obviously a larger crowd that gathered during the 
25 day and that there was some unstableness in the

1 crowd, but at this point, were those 10 to 15 
2 people, were they interfering at all, were they 
3 creating a disturbance? 
4 A They were making some noise regarding who 
5 the body was and it was at that point in time that I 
6 grabbed some crime scene tape out of my police 
7 vehicle, gave it to the two officers that were 
8 already there and told them to start setting up a 
9 perimeter to keep people back. 
10 Q And so at this point it is fair to say 
11 that you didn't know whose body was in the street, 
12 correct? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
And none of the other officers at this 
15 point had identified who was in the street, correct? 
16 A To the best of my knowledge, that's 
17 correct. 
18 Q And then other people that were gathering 
19 in the area, people were wondering who it was 
20 because maybe it was someone they knew or a loved 
21 one of their's, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So there was some agitation or stress 
24 involved with people that were there, they were 
25 concerned about who that was?

A Yes, ma'am. 
Q And is that typical that when EMS is

13 to the call? 
14 A It actually depends on the call. If it is 
15 a more critical call, such as a life threat, a heart 
16 attack, difficulty breathing, yes, they would 
17 respond with the EMS personnel. 
18 Q So it is not unusual that on this type of 
19 call that the firetruck came too? 
20 A Not at all, no, ma'am. 
21 Q There was no fire or anything of that 
22 nature, correct? 
23 A Correct.

2 A The two police officers did, no other fire 
3 personnel or ambulance personnel. 
4 Q Now, at this point is Darren Wilson still 
5 in the vehicle? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q Did he get out of the car when you got 
8 there? 
9 A The only time he got out of the car is 
10 when I told him to get into my vehicle and leave the 
11 scene. 
12 Q Okay. So he stayed in his own car until 
13 you told him to take your car and go back to 
14 Ferguson Police Department? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
So going back now, we kind of got the 
17 scene what it looked like when you first got there, 
18 what's the first thing you did when you drove down 
19 the street and saw Darren Wilson's car facing you in 
20 the street the way it was? 
21 A I pulled off onto a driveway apron, right 
22 off the street, parked my car and then I walked over 
23 to speak with Officer Wilson. 
24 Q So contacting Officer Wilson was the first 
25 thing you did?

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And what did you say to Officer Wilson? 
I initially asked him what had happened. 
Now, you and I talked yesterday about your 
8 recollection of Officer Wilson's statement. And we 
9 talked about the fact that sometimes when you are 
10 recounting a statement, you kind of like use your 
11 own words to paraphrase? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
We also talked about that police officers 
14 have what we call like cop talk, where you use 
15 phrases and words that are typical in police lingo 
16 or vernacular, wouldn't that be fair to say? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Oh, yes, ma'am. 
And remember and recall that yesterday 
19 when you and I talked about this, it is important 
20 for today that you as best you can use Darren 
21 Wilson's words, don't try to paraphrase, don't try 
22 to put your spin on things. And I know I don't mean 
23 that you would do that intentionally, but if he 
24 didn't say that it was, you know, forceful or if he 
25 didn't use the words, try not to use your own words,

Q 
That's what I asked him, yes, ma'am. 
All right. And as best you recall, what's 
7 the first thing he said to you? 
8 A He said I had to shoot him. 
9 I asked him why? 
10 He said he had been walking in the 
11 street, I told him to get off the sidewalk, or get 
12 on the sidewalk. 
13 I said okay. 
14 He said well, they told me to fuck 
15 off. I slowed my car down, or he slowed his car 
16 down and I told him, hey, all you got to do is get 
17 out of the street and get on the sidewalk.

19 saying I told them, so you are talking as Officer 
20 Wilson and that's good.

Q 
That is what he told me. 
That's how I want you to do this. So

1 and he said the individual laying on the street came 
2 up to the side of his car and started hitting on him 
3 through the window. 
4 I said hitting you? 
5 He goes, yeah, he reached in, he hit me on 
6 the side of my face several times, and grabbed at my 
7 shirt, grabbed at my hands and arms. 
8 He said I was trying to get out of the 
9 vehicle and he wouldn't let me out, he kept pushing 
10 the door closed. 
11 The individual reached in and was trying 
12 to grab at his pistol, his pistol came out of his 
13 holster. He told me he had control of the weapon, 
14 but it was being pointed at him. He had the gun in 
15 his hand, but the muzzle of the weapon had been 
16 turned where his hand was actually turned toward 
17 him. 
18 And he said he was still getting hit 
19 with one hand at times and there was a struggle over 
20 the gun. He said the weapon was, he didn't get 
21 control of the weapon, but he was able to turn the 
22 weapon away from himself and the firearm discharged. 
23 He said the gun went off. 
24 Q Is that how he described it, the gun went 
25 off?

7 actually got shot, he said I think I shot him in the 
8 stomach. And I looked at the side of the car door, 
9 and there was no exit on the door, it was just a 
10 dimple in the sheet metal. 
11 I said what happened then? 
12 He said he started running, I got out 
13 of the car to chase after him. He said he got down 
14 about 30, 40 feet from where the car was parked and 
15 for some reason the individual stopped and turned 
16 toward him. 
17 I said okay. 
18 He said, at that point he said 
19 something to the effect of, you're too much of a

21 started to charge at Officer Wilson.

1 involved in that type of critical scene, what is 
2 your focus and what's your training tell you to 
3 focus on? 
4 A You focus on your target. I'm sorry, not 
5 target, but you focus on whose angry at you, whose 
6 coming at you or whose trying to harm you. 
7 Q So would it be fair to say that you focus 
8 on the threat? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And is it unusual or typical, I guess, 
11 that you kind of lose focus of other things that 
12 might be going on around you? 
13 A No, it is not unusual. You get kind of 
14 like tunnel vision. You only see, like you said, 
15 the threat. 
16 Q All right. And so let me ask you this. 
17 When Darren Wilson told you about, for example, he 
18 said that there were two men walking in the street 
19 and he told them to get on the sidewalk, did he tell 
20 you whatever became or happened to that other 
21 individual?

Q 
No, ma'am. 
Did you see, we now know Michael Brown was 
24 shot dead in the street, did you see the other

1 individual that Officer Wilson saw walking with 
2 Michael Brown? 
3 A No, ma'am. 
4 Q Now, understanding how important this 
5 initial statement might be, is there a reason why 
6 you did not record his statement? 
7 A Number one, I did not have a recorder. 
8 Number two, I didn't take notes because at that 
9 point in time I had multiple things going through my 
10 mind besides what Darren was telling me. 
11 Q You've already said that before arriving 
12 at the scene you didn't even know that this was a 
13 shooting, would that be fair to say? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
You didn't hear other radio traffic from 
16 other officers saying that there had been a 
17 shooting?

Q 
No, ma'am. 
So describe for the jurors how Darren 
20 Wilson appeared to you, his demeanor, first of all? 
21 A He appeared in a state of shock. He was 
22 staring at the dashboard of his vehicle initially. 
23 It was only after maybe a couple of questions that 
24 he finally looked at me. I could see the side of 
25 his face, especially around his mouth starting to

Did you notice any blood on him?

21 direction and charged him. I'm just kind of 
22 catching up. So I know it was in a little more 
23 detail and then he shot him and Michael Brown went 
24 down on the street?

24 15 seconds and just walked away.

14 anyone else, either law enforcement or any other 
15 civilians get close to the body?

19 to make sure nobody kicked it or disturbed its 
20 location.

1 statement that you were at the scene until the scene 
2 was done, which would have been after 5:00? 
3 A It was closer to 6:15, 6:30, yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And now you are aware then that the body 
5 of Michael Brown lay in the street under that sheet 
6 for several hours on that day; is that right? 
7

9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Is that, do you know the reason for that? 
After I made notification to command 
10 staff, I was recontacted and advised that St. Louis 
11 County would be handling the investigation and the 
12 crime scene and I had to await their arrival. Once 
13 they arrived, the crime scene was relinquished to 
14 them. 
15 Q And then any decision about what would 
16 happen with the body, that wasn't your decision or 
17 anything you had to do with, is that fair to say? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Were you the most senior ranking Ferguson 
20 police officer at the scene that day? 
21 A Uh, I had two lieutenants show up later on 
22 shortly after, maybe around 1:00 or so. 
23 Q Now, you testified that you made 
24 notification, who is the first person you called? 
25 A Chief of Police.

1 Q All right. Now, you've already said that 
2 at some point you told Darren Wilson to get into 
3 your vehicle and go up to the Ferguson Police 
4 Department? 
A Yes, ma'am. 5 
6 Q And what was the reason, are you aware 
7 that an officer involved shooting, typically the 
8 officer remains on scene until investigators come 
9 and walk through the scene with him? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Q Why didn't you have him remain at the 
scene?

14 
A The crowd was growing rather rapidly. 
They were very agitated and for the safety of the 
15 officers on the scene and for Officer Wilson, I had 
16 him leave and go to the police department. 
17 Q So you had him get in your vehicle and go 
18 to the police department? 
19 A Yes, ma'am. I left his vehicle where it 
20 was, where I found it and told him to take my car 
21 and go back to the station and wait for a 
22 supervisor. 
23 Q And after he got out of his car, did 
24 anyone, did you enter his vehicle? 
25 A No, ma'am.

18 Q Now, to be clear, you're not actually a

20 you know, you knew other officers were going to be 
21 processing that vehicle, didn't you? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
In fact, I think in your statement, but

25 markers around pieces of evidence if you see them,
