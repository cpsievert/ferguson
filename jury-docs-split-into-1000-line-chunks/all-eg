1 A That's why I was afraid of them being so 
2 close and he just tipped right over. 
3 Q Are you saying you saw it or you just

Q 
So you don't know where he was shot? 
No. 
You're just guessing because he fell over? 
Yes. 
And then once he's on the ground you see

13 while he's lying face first on the ground?

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So after the police car is a black car you 
16 said, is there another car after the black car?

19 on the map is about where Mike Brown stopped running 
20 and turned around? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And that would have been where he fell 
23 then since you said he didn't move forward or 
24 backward at this point? 
25 A Yes, ma'am.
