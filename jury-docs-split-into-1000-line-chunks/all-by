5 was it cocking back, is there any sort of smoke, 
6 shell casing, anything that you may have seen or 
7 heard during that? 
8 A No, no, he just, I say immediately, when 
9 they started running, he just gets out of his car 
10 and I see him in his shooting position and he lets 
11 out some rounds. So I didn't see no shells fall or 
12 no gun smoke or anything. 
13 As he is progressing, is 
14 he continually moving, what is he doing? 
15 A He's, he's, he's taking, he's taking like 
16 large steps, so I didn't see him like run or 
17 anything, so he is just taking large steps, you 
18 know, towards him, you know, while his back is 
19 turned towards him.

A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. So here is this, do you see this 
20 little grassy area here? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yeah, that's my apartment. 
You can see that's kind of reflected in 
23 the diagram? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Oh, that's what that is supposed to be. 
I think so, do you see that?

A 
Q 
Page 43 
Yeah. 
So the truck is about, you know, somewhere 
3 in this area according to the diagram, correct? 
4 A No, it was actually up here, like right 
5 here. (indicating) 
6 Q Okay. 
7 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
So closer, like up here. 
You think it was closer up to here? 
Yeah, I know it was because there is a 
10 sign right here and it kind of evened itself up. I 
11 just know it was closer to the driveway right here. 
12 (indicating) 
13 Q So let me ask you this. Do you think that 
14 the police officer measured it wrong or do you think 
15 that the, anybody moved the truck? 
16 A No, no, I know that the truck was right 
17 here, it was definitely right here. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Just before this driveway diagonally in 
20 the middle of the street. 
21 Q Okay. And you see here this line right 
22 here that kind of looks like the edge of the 
23 driveway? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
That's the edge of the driveway. 
You say the truck was more up here?

1 A More right here, before the driveways 
2 that's across from each other. 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Do you all have your 
4 diagrams? 
5 (All indicate yes.) 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: I can also put this up 
7 there. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So now here is in 
9 diagram the depiction of where Michael Brown's body 
10 came to rest, okay. And here is the little, the 
11 driveway or the street Caddiefield, and as you can 
12 see here, is Copper Creek Court up here to the 
13 north. 
14 So the way they have it, his body is 
15 somewhere right around here. You don't think that's 
16 right? 
17 A No, it is not right. His body is 
18 definitely right here because like I said, I live 
19 there and that's the driveway right here, his death 
20 bed is just a little bit past the driveway, just a 
21 little bit past the driveway. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: You all want me to put this 
23 up here so he can point and follow along with yours? 
24 You were 
25 standing on your balcony, I believe that distance in

1 your mind that's where you would see him because you 
2 are on a balcony, so that's the distance your eyes 
3 were focused where the two people are in position. 
4 And so you seen Mike collapse, I believe that from 
5 your balcony that's, that's where your eyes focused 
6 that that's where he laid, but actually like 
7 everything was done, they did the measurements, that 
8 it was a little bit further than your eyes focused 
9 on where he actually fell. So not saying that 
10 you're wrong, that's just from the vision point of 
11 your perspective that's where you were standing. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: And she's exactly right. 
13 I'm not trying to say you are lying about this or 
14 anything, I mean, don't make it, don't feel like 
15 you're on the defensive, like I'm trying to point 
16 out that you're wrong or that you weren't really 
17 there. 
18 
19 
A I was there. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I know you were there. But 
20 people remember things differently or they see 
21 things from a different perspective, distances are 
22 hard to judge. And so I just want to clear things 
23 up and I'm going to show you what is a photograph 
24 that was taken by the detective who processed the 
25 scene.

1 What's the envelope you took that out of, 
2 Sheila? Oh, here it is. This came out of Grand 
3 Jury Exhibit Number 3. And it is Image Number 3, 
4 you see that three on the back there? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yeah. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) So this is the image 
7 that the detective took of the police car? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That's the police car right there. 
That's the officer's vehicle, yes. Does 
10 that help you get a perspective of where the car 
11 might have been? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
You may be right. 
So you don't think that helps you? 
No, no, I think it really does. So if I'm 
15 on my balcony, that's why, I know it's a little wall 
16 right here, so from my balcony right here it is on 
17 the side. So I could barely see kind of because I 
18 got barbecue grills right here. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Uh-huh. 
So I kind of leaned over and still see the 
21 vehicle right there, but I'm thinking, you know, 
22 right there on this picture. 
23 Q Sure. Okay. And you see the corner here, 
24 I believe, that's probably that corner right there, 
25 right?

Yeah, Canfield. 
And then I'm going to show you Image 
Uh-huh. 
So this is where his body came to rest and 
6 this is Copper Creek Court right here. Does it 
7 appear to be right in front of this building, right 
8 here?

10 
A 
Q 
Yeah, right in the front. 
So would that be more like right here?

what I think that's right, yeah, okay. 
Q So does that help you? 
A Yeah. 
Q I'm not trying to get you to change what 
say you saw because we all understand? 
A Yeah, I saw what I saw, it is just the 
19 parked vehicle and the body from my window and 
20 balcony. 
21 Q Okay. Just again to clarify, you're not 
22 saying anybody moved the car or moved the body, 
23 correct? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
No, I didn't see nobody move the body. 
So seeing those photographs, you believe
