17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Between the time you saw it and the time 
19 that the county officer talked to you, did you talk 
20 to anybody else about what you had seen? 
21 A Urn, actually, I discussed it with the 
22 people that were standing outside. 
23 Q How about , did you and , before 
24 you talked to the County Police, did you and

3 time and we did discuss that, what we seen that day, 
4 we did talk about that.

Q Okay. Before you talked to the officers? 
A Yes, ma'am.

8 he had seen? 
9 A Actually, like I say, we just discussed 
10 the situation that we were just in together.

Q Now, you know today, don't you, that there 
17 are, there is an issue about whether Michael Brown 
18 had his hands up, such as in a surrendering pose, 
19 versus whether his hands were in some other 
20 position, you know that today, right?

1 any of the groups that have a position one way or

3 protestors, I don't want to lump them altogether. I

6 A Actually, no, ma'am.

8 that hands up has kind of been a mantra of the 
9 people protesting, right? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
When you gave your statement to Detective 
12 , just about six hours after this happened, you

A 
Q 
Yes. 
So I'm going to show you, this is a copy 
6 of the transcript of when you talked to Detective 
7 Up here it says August 9th, about 6:40 p.m. 
8 and it starts out him saying this is Detective

10 Florissant. Does this look like the transcript that 
11 you saw when you listened to your statement?

Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. Now, I'm going to direct your 
14 attention to page seven, and you can look through 
15 this all you want. I'm just getting to a point 
16 where you start talking about, oh about halfway, a 
17 little more than halfway down. You are talking 
18 about having seen him get shot at the car and then 
19 you said after he did that, I looked up and now by 
20 this time, I'm looking up because I'm terrified. 
21 Now, I'm looking up in my rear view 
22 mirror, that's when I see the young man. Well, he 
23 already ran past and then a police officer ran past. 
24 So when I looked up, I saw the young man turn, he 
25 was facing the police officer, he was towards the

2 Did I read that accurately? 
3 A Uh-huh. 
4 Q And then the detective says, Okay. So you 
5 saw the young man's face? 
6 And you say, yes, sir. 
7 And he said, but you saw the police 
8 officer's back. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
And you say, in my rear view mirror? 
And he says, the officer says okay. 
And then you saw, and I saw I heard 
just three more gunshots, I don't know if it was 
or three, I know it dot dot dot, and I think you 
14 making the sound of gunshot, right? Dot dot dot. 
15 And then I saw when the young man just hit the 
two 
are 
16 ground. When he hit the ground, I just got terror, 
17 I mean, I was just stunned. And I never seen 
18 nothing like that in my life. So I just end up 
19 proceeding to get away. 
20 In the process of me getting away, 
21 another truck came to me and almost hit me head-on. 
22 Did I go over that accurately?

1 was an exciting thing that you saw. And your 
2 emotions were high, wouldn't you say? 
3 A (Nods head.) 
4 Q So you didn't mention to Detective 
5 when he talked to you that Michael Brown had his 
6 hands up? 
7 A Okay. 
8 Q And he asked you at the end of your 
9 statement is there anything else that you can think 
10 of that, you know, that you saw that's important. 
11 And you said, no, you didn't think of anything else?

Wouldn't it have been important to tell

Okay. Let me ask you this. Do you think, 
17 I think everybody agrees that our memories change 
18 over time. Something that I saw, if I go to see a 
19 movie, I remember the movie better right after I see 
20 it than a year later. I might not remember who 
21 starred in it or all the details about it, and I 
22 know we're not talking about a year later, but do 
23 you understand what I'm talking about, memories 
24 changing?

say that I was 
9 overexcited. In my mind, my mind was gone, like I 
10 said, I have never seen nothing like that in my 
11 life. So, therefore, that was probably something 
12 that I didn't mention at the time. But I saw what I 
13 saw in the rear view mirror and that's basically all 
14 that I can say.

16 about before you testified, and didn't I tell you

19 eventually try to figure out what really happened as

22 And so you understand, you believe me

3 Michael Brown's hands being up?

Yes.

5 When the 
6 officer put his car in reverse to kind of, I think 
7 you said kind of cut off the two men, did he spin 
8 his tires, did you hear the tires squealing at that 
9 point? 
10 A It just went to like a halt, just like a 
11 stop, just a sudden stop. 
12 It wasn't real aggressive 
13 backwards then where the tires were spinning? 
14 A Actually, when he went back to reverse, it 
15 was pretty quick. It was a fast reverse, like you 
16 hit your accelerator and hit the brakes, just 
17 quickly. 
18 Okay. And in your rear 
19 view mirror, were there other vehicles lined up 
20 behind you at that point after the officer ran past

1 far, how many feet from where you were to Michael 
2 Brown, how many feet were they or how far, maybe two

5 three, three to four cars distance.

16 was far that I could see his face.

18 couple of questions. The first question is when 
19 Dorian stooped down at your car and asked to get in, 
20 did you see anything in his hands?

22 
A At that time, no, ma'am. 
Second question is, when

Q 
A 
It was immediately. 
Immediately? 
Immediately after that, after the car did

6 Okay. That's it. 
7 From your 
8 perspective, would you say the officer used, I'll 
9 let you use the description, what amount of force 
10 would you say the officer used in this situation? 
A Urn, excessive force. 
Okay. 
When you 
11 
12 
13 
14 sat down with Detective , is it safe to say he 
15 never asked you where Michael Brown's hands were? 
16 A Correct, that's correct. He never really 
17 asked me that question. 
18 In 
19 answer, dovetailing off question, 
20 if I heard you correctly, you said that the officer 
21 did use excessive force; is that correct? 
22 A Yes, ma'am. 
23 Can you tell me why you 
24 feel that way. 
25 A Actually, I think he used excessive force

1 because it was after he chased him down, that's 
2 where my actions come in, when he chased after him, 
3 that's what I mean by excessive force because he was 
4 running away from him. 
5 Okay. So after he ran 
6 away from him and then the second shots, or the 
7 second series of shots, okay. And are you saying 
8 after that there shouldn't have been any more shots? 
9 A Actually, I'm saying once he ran away and 
10 got a nice little distance, there shouldn't have 
11 been any more shots. 
12 Okay. 
13 Just to clarify 
14 one question, when gave his statement to the 
15 County, they asked him about after Wilson had moved 
16 past the car and brought up that there were 
17 two or three, up to four cars behind you. They 
18 started lining up after that, but you are saying 
19 there were no cars behind you? 
20 
21 
A I didn't see any cars. 
I have a 
22 question about after what she said. You are looking 
23 at all of this through the rear view mirror, right?

1 force and you said that after he ran away there 
2 should have been no more shots. What do you think 
3 should have happened, do you think he should have 
4 let Michael Brown just run away? You didn't hear 
5 anything being said like stop or you didn't hear 
6 what was going on. 
7 A Halt, none of that. 
8 You didn't see the 
9 tussle, so you don't know what happened. Do you 
10 feel like the police officer should have just let 
11 Michael Brown run away and get away and not try to 
12 stop him even if he did break the law? 
13 A In somewhat, and the reason why I say that 
14 is because if he would have let him get away, if he 
15 was shot at any time, he would have been found. Had 
16 the police have swarmed in, they would have got him 
17 even if he would have run, even if he would have got 
18 away, they would have captured him. 
19 So you feel like he would 
20 have gotten away and then they would have captured 
21 him and he would have been arrested, not killed? 
22

11 is basically some attorneys and some news reporters 
12 kind of commenting on the statements that were made 
13 and again, it is really not evidence and we don't 
14 really, I don't feel it is helpful to have other 
15 persons' perspectives what they think these 
16 statements mean. So we did not play that last clip 
17 for you. It really isn't a statement of a witness.

MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.

13 rain water out of the gutters further away from the 
14 building so it would stop flooding the bottom 
15 floors. 
16 Q Were you working by yourself or was there 
17 someone else on the job with you? 
18 A Most of the week there was like four of us 
19 there and then Saturday it was just me and one other 
20 guy.
