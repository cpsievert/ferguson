So, uh, and then I end up looking out the 
3 back window, I guess, coming down the way or 
4 whatnot. Like the whole time I don't know, I 
5 blanked out or whatnot because I'm not hearing 
6 anything, but I didn't hear nothing from the time 
7 that they was at the truck. We are both, from the 
8 officer's truck to the time he was running and 
9 whatnot because I guess he had got down the street 
10 some, a little after him or whatnot.

19 view mirror. So I guess they got down the street, 
20 you know, got down towards, they still in the yellow 
21 line the whole time. So get down, get down a way 
22 and Mike Brown kind of swayed and turned around. 
23 His hands weren't fully up, he kind of turned around 
24 and he was just like that, and then he slid off 
25 three more shots and fell on his face. (indicating)

14 I couldn't hear that far back, you know. He was 
15 probably, he was up by some other cars, so I 
16 couldn't hear that far or whatnot. So I guess he
