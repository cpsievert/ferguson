done, do you know the timeframe? 
No, that was not shared with me. 
Okay. Before you released 
12 the body from your office. 
13 A Uh-huh. 
14 Is the body cleaned in any 
15 way. 
16 A I mean --
17 Do you wash it down like 
18 with distilled or stabilized water. 
19 A The autopsy technician, like I said, doing 
20 the autopsy is not a totally clean process. You 
21 don't want to have blood all over the place from 
22 point of health hazards and visually esthetic 
23 purposes, it just doesn't look good. 
24 With water, the body is washed also 
25 so it is not all bloody and things of that nature.

Okay. And this is just

3 A No problem.

5 and usually if I bet on something, I know pretty

8 Going from what you know 
9 that you've done in this autopsy and from your 
10 experience, like would you bet, I'm not going to say 
11 bet your life, but would you bet your bottom dollar 
12 that you are 100 percent correct about your finding?

20 who he is.

22 On the 
23 case examine, I notice that on Michael Brown's lower 
24 extremity there were several scars on his knee and 
25 on his lower left leg.

2 Was there any damage to 
3 his lower extremities that was recent? 
4 A No. 
5 Nothing consistent with 
6 his foot being ran over? 
7 A No. 
8 , I'm sorry. 
9 When you say you wash the body, you don't like scrub 
10 it or any use any soap or anything, it is just 
11 water?

14 view of what's going on? 
15 
16 
17 
A 
Dr. 
Yeah. 
MS. ALIZADEH: In fact, I think, 
, if you recall from your previous 
18 testimony there's a series of photos that are taken 
19 before the body is washed and then there's a series 
20 of photos taken afterwards, and in cleaning parts of 
21 the body, is that so you can visualize the wounds 
22 and see what you are looking at?

A Correct. 2 
3 Q Okay. And just also to clarify when you 
4 did your autopsy, the body of Michael Brown had not

1 Q And so in your job with the military, do 
2 you perform autopsies? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And do you perform autopsies and then 
5 prepare reports regarding your findings? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And have you testified in court regarding 
8 your findings after performing autopsies? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, I have. 
And so in relation to this case, you know 
11 that you are here because you performed an autopsy 
12 on the remains of Michael Brown, correct? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q When were you contacted, approximately, in 
15 order, when did you first learn that you were being 
16 asked to perform for an autopsy? 
17 A I believe August 18th was the day that we 
18 performed the autopsy, I know that. I think that 
19 was a Monday. I don't recall specifically, but I 
20 remember getting a call when I was at home from my 
21 boss. It was probably Sunday, the day before. 
22 Q Okay. And what did your boss tell you 
23 about what you were being asked to do? 
24 A Well, he said that the Department of 
25 Justice was making a special request from the

1 Department of Defense to perform an independent and 
2 non-biased autopsy on a civilian that had died in 
3 St. Louis. 
4 Q So was it unusual for you to perform an 
5 autopsy on civilians? 
6 A I would not say it is unusual for me to do 
7 autopsies on civilians. We perform autopsies on 
8 anyone that dies in federal jurisdictions as long as 
9 it's a medical examiner's case. If there's a 
10 civilian on a federal installation, we will be 
11 responsible for performing that post-mortem 
12 examination. 
13 Q So, for example, a serviceman, serviceman 
14 who maybe lives on base, his child dies and there is 
15 a need for an autopsy? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
That's a civilian, correct? 
Correct. 
Someone who may be, would be shot during a 
20 bank robbery, that would be a federal case, but that 
21 wouldn't necessarily be military, involved? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Okay. And so, so you were told that you 
24 were be requested by the Department of Justice to 
25 perform an independent and unbiased autopsy, is that

1 right? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Page 72 
Correct. 
Were you are told that the body had 
4 already been autopsy previous? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, I was. 
And did you, were you told that it had 
7 been autopsy twice? 
8 A Definitively it had been autopsy at least 
9 once before by the St. Louis County Medical 
10 Examiner's Office. There was some rumor at the time 
11 that a second independent autopsy had been 
12 performed, but we weren't sure at that time. 
13 Q Now, did, when you were notified about 
14 this, did they tell you who you were going to be 
15 autopsying? 
16 A At that time the name was given to me over 
17 the phone. 
18 Q Did they tell you it was going to be the 
19 body of Michael Brown? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
They did. 
And on August 18th, had you ever heard of 
22 Michael Brown? 
23 A In fact, I was ignorant. I'm not sure why 
24 I hadn't been watching media on this. I know there 
25 was a lot of coverage that I know now, at the time

1 this was the first I was hearing of it at that phone 
2 conversation that Sunday. 
3 Q So you had not viewed or at least had not 
4 made any connection between the media coverage 
5 regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown and 
6 the allegations that are being and were being made 
7 at the time with the autopsy that you were 
8 performing? 
9 A Correct, this was the first I was hearing 
10 of it. 
11 Q And so did you travel to St. Louis to 
12 perform the autopsy? 
13 A Yes, ma'am, I did. 
14 Q Did anyone come with you? 
15 A I was accompanied by one of our senior 
16 forensic pathologist was a Navy captain. He 
17 probably has 15 or 20 years experience named 
18 Dr. We performed the autopsy 
19 together and whenever we travel to do a case, we 
20 also bring one of our photographers. We have a 
21 staff of photographers that will accompany us when 
22 we go on road cases. So I had a photographer and 
23 Dr. accompany me. 
24 Q And so prior to doing the autopsy, did you 
25 learn anything additional that helped you to do the

1 autopsy? 
2 A So once we arrived at the Medical 
3 Examiner's Office, they welcomed us in, essentially 
4 gave us all access to the radiology, all the x-rays 
5 they had taken on the day that they performed their 
6 case, which I believe was the lOth of August. 
7 So before any gunshot wound case, we 
8 need to review the radiology in order to see what 
9 bony structures have been injured, if there are any 
10 projectiles in the body that need to be recovered. 
11 So this is standard procedure. 
12 So they gave me access to those 
13 x-rays and then I also was able to look at a small 
14 scene investigation synopsis probably a few 
15 paragraphs, I guess dating back to the 9th or lOth 
16 of August. So I had that information to review 
17 before we performed our, I guess, third autopsy. 
18 Q Do you recall what you learned from that 
19 scene synopsis? 
20 A It was just that there was an individual 
21 that had an altercation with a police officer and 
22 that he received multiple gunshot wounds and died at 
23 the scene. 
24 Q Did you have any information about, for 
25 example, whether or not there was an altercation at

1 or near a police vehicle? 
2 
3 
A It wasn't specified in what I had read. 
Q Okay. Did you have any information that 
4 there were perhaps conflicting reports about whether 
5 or not the individual was running or standing still 
6 or turning or what position his body was in? 
7 A I don't recall that being elaborated in 
8 that small synopsis, no. 
9 Q Okay. And so when you arrived at the 
10 Medical Examiner's Office in St. Louis County, did 
11 you speak with any of the medical examiners in St. 
12 Louis County? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. I spoke with Dr. right 
14 before we performed our own procedure and then 
15 afterwards, I spoke with Dr. 
16 Q So Dr. would be the chief medical 
17 examiner for St. Louis County? 
18 A To my knowledge, she is the chief at that 
19 office, yes, I believe so. 
20 Q All right. And did she give you any 
21 information that you felt was necessary in order for 
22 you to perform the autopsy? 
23 A She didn't provide any additional 
24 information before the autopsy itself. She was just 
25 there mostly to facilitate and make sure things were

1 going smoothly and she allowed us to actually use 
2 one of their own technicians to help with the case. 
3 Q Do you recall who that technician was? 
4 A I do not recall. I saw him in the 
5 photographs from the first autopsy, I don't recall 
6 his name. We have a full ledger in our own case 
7 file of everybody that was present in that room, 
8 which would include that technician as well as an 
9 FBI agent. 
10 Q And so the photographs that you mentioned 
11 that you saw from the first autopsy. 
12 A That is correct, but I did not get to see 
13 those until after we performed our own examination. 
14 Q Is that because they wouldn't allow you to 
15 see them, but you wanted to? 
16 A We actually prefer that we did not look at 
17 any photographs before completing our own autopsy. 
18 We felt like we were there to perform our own 
19 independent study. We didn't want to get biased by 
20 other photographs. 
21 Q All right. And when you arrived at the 
22 Medical Examiner's Office, I assume that the body 
23 was identified to you as the body of Michael Brown? 
24 A That is correct. He also had 
25 identification bracelets around his ankles and his

1 wrist that said Michael Brown. 
2 Q And did your photographer take photographs 
3 of the different stages of the autopsy? 
4 A Yes. We have a very specific protocol in 
5 the military in the way we deal with photographs and 
6 we performed our autopsy the same way we would as if 
7 it was a service member for a normal autopsy. 
8 When we arrive the body was 
9 discovered in several blankets. We take a 
10 photograph of that and then we removed those 
11 blankets and then we begin our standard photographs, 
12 which would include identification bracelets and 
13 anything else that could identify the body. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Are you looking for the 
15 other file? 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Sorry. 
17 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) For the record, we are 
18 using a disc that I've marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 
19 Number 79, and there are a number of photographs on 
20 this disc. And I'll ask you, Dr. if it is 
21 easier for you, and it might be, to maybe wheel that 
22 chair, you don't need to worry about the microphone 
23 picking you up, it will pick you up and you would be 
24 in a better position to look.

Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Do you recognize this placard? 
I do. We use this placard on all of our 
11 autopsies, this is how we start all of the 
12 photography with this placard. And usually we make 
13 this at Dover Air Force Base before we go to the 
14 actual case.

Q 
A 
And the side of that placard says 
, St. Louis, Missouri? 
Correct. We were the two pathologists 
18 that were performing this autopsy. 
19 Q Okay. The date at the top, is that the 
20 date that you prepared the placard or the date that 
21 you actually performed the autopsy? 
22 
23 by 
A So this placard would have been prepared 
at the bottom, he's our photographer. I'm 
24 not sure if he did it the day before or the morning 
25 we flew out, but that was the day we performed the

So AFMES, what's that? 
Arm Force Medical Examiner System. That's 
4 where we work and we're stationed out of Dover Air 
5 Force Base. 
6 Q You have your own case number? 
7 A Correct. ME140240. 
8 Q Then you said MCCS , that's the 
9 photographer that you brought along with you? 
10 A Correct. I'm not in the Navy, so I don't 
11 know what MCCS stands for. He's a senior chief 
12 enlisted in the Navy. I'm not sure what that means. 
13 Q So you indicated that when you first 
14 arrived and the body was presented to you, it was 
15 wrapped in some blankets and that you took some, 
16 that your photographer took some pictures. 
17 There is, in this next image, Image 
18 Number 2, you can see something that's inside a 
19 blanket and there is a piece of paper perhaps that's 
20 on top of the blanket and that is your case number, 
21 correct? 
22 A Correct. We label all of our images no 
23 the matter what they are with a case number. I 
24 think that is just important for us to do not to 
25 misplace images across different autopsies.

1 Q This was all done at the Medical 
2 Examiner's Office here, correct? 
3 A Correct. This entire autopsy was done 
4 here, but these placards that we are seeing were 
5 things we had printed up before we arrived. 
6 Q Okay. So Image Number 3, and that is 
7 another different view of the body underneath the 
8 blankets? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Image Number 4. And so now in this image, 
11 we're seeing the lower half of the body and you 
12 indicated that there were bracelets, there is a 
13 green bracelet around the right hand and then there 
14 are bracelets around the ankles of the body. Did 
15 those identify the body as Michael Brown? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. I think we have closer up 
17 images that show his name actually written on these 
18 bracelets, but they did. 
19 Q And the next image. And then this is the 
20 upper half of his body; is that correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now just viewing this as we see it and as 
23 you saw it that day, can you tell by looking at it 
24 then that this body has been autopsied?

Yes, this is the standard Y incision that

1 we do in the United States and it has been sutured 
2 together. 
3 Q All right. And the next photo. Again, 
4 you indicated that you took close-up images of the 
5 actual identifying bracelets around the wrist and 
6 ankles s of the body, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And the next image and then the next, and 
9 the next, and then the next. Sorry, and so the last 
10 image we've already seen that image. So now we saw 
11 a number of images that you could see close up the 
12 bracelets that identified the body and now do you 
13 know why this image was taken? 
14 A Again, this is just our standard protocol. 
15 So at this point we would consider the body, usually 
16 the bodies that we are dealing with are actually 
17 still within the body bag, the human remains pouch. 
18 This is just a standard image. 
19 After we remove the blankets, 
20 whatever was underneath him, we will take pictures 
21 of him on the actual autopsy surface that we are 
22 going to be performing the case on. 
23 Q Okay. 
24 A So again, pretty much redundant 
25 information.

A They are, they are. We have already 
3 removed the blankets. 
4 Q All right. Now, this is an image of the 
5 lower half of his body, but he's turned over and 
6 he's lying on his stomach? 
7 A Correct. And you can see here some 
8 evidence of decomposition change, some skin 
9 slippage. 
10 Q And we see some discoloration on the, 
11 maybe I shouldn't characterize it as discoloration, 
12 you can see that there is definitely some different 
13 color to his skin, what's that caused by? 
14 A Correct. So the body has been embalmed, I 
15 think any images you may have seen up to this point 
16 have been from the first autopsy. So now, you know, 
17 eight days later, the body has been embalmed, been 
18 three, several other autopsies. So when the body's 
19 playing flat on the table getting embalmed, some of 
20 the embalming fluid may not reach these areas 
21 because the skin is pressed against a flat surface 
22 that prevents it from getting in. So I think any 
23 changes in tone or color is probably due to that. 
24 Q All right. So those aren't anything that 
25 you feel that were caused by the injuries that he

No.

Page 83 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask him, what's the 
5 white. 
6 A This here? Skin slippage. It is 
7 decomposition. 
8 Again, the skin here isn't going to 
9 be as embalmed as the skin on the front. He's 
10 laying on his back, so this area could be prone to 
11 decomposition. 
12 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the embalming 
13 process is to slow down decomposition? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q And then you see the back of the upper 
16 half of his body. And you see some injuries to his 
17 body from that photograph; is that correct? 
18 A Correct. And this photograph we can see 
19 clearly, it is hard to tell from here, but that's 
20 the exit gunshot wound from a gunshot wound to his 
21 forearm. 
22 And then here is actually an autopsy 
23 artifact, that's where they had removed a bullet 
24 gunshot wound to the right lateral chest. That's 
25 where they recovered that round during the first

1 autopsy. 
2 Q Now, were you able to tell that just by 
3 looking at it? 
4 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Or did you have to examine it? 
This information I'm giving you is after I 
7 examined the entire case. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
I did not know at the time of first 
10 looking at his back that that was where they 
11 recovered a round from the first autopsy. 
12 Q And you weren't able to conclude that from 
13 the x-rays either? 
14 A No, because the x-rays, all we have is 
15 pretty much one dimension anterior and posterior, so 
16 it is hard to tell where exactly the bullet is. I 
17 only know it's in the right side of the chest 
18 somewhere, but in this situation, it was actually in 
19 the back. 
20 So you need x-rays from two different 
21 angles in order to really tell that, which we didn't 
22 have. 
23 Q All right. 
24 MS. WHIRLEY: There's no indication that 
25 he was shot in his back?

No, I would not at any point thought that 
2 was a gunshot wound. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) The next slide, is this 
4 a repetition of the previous, of a previous slide 
5 we've seen? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q Which is the body still on its stomach and 
8 it is the lower half of his body. And the next 
9 slide and again, is this repetitious of --
10 A 
11 again. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
I'm not sure why we are looking at this 
Okay. 
Just closer up image of the same thing, 
14 this is that defect that they created during the 
15 first autopsy to remove that round. 
16 Q And you learned that after your autopsy? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q But looking at that, you can say that that 
19 is not an entrance wound, a gunshot entrance wound? 
20 A That is correct. And there is no evidence 
21 here of any, what we would say a sign of life. 
22 There is no vital reaction here, there is no blood, 
23 there is no inflammation around these edges, this 
24 looks like a post-mortem phenomenon and that's what 
25 it is.

Q 
A 
Page 86 
All right. Is that a closer up of the 
Correct. As you get closer you can 
3 actually see a scalpel injury here, it's all 
4 post-mortem, it is where they removed it. 
5 Q And the next image. Describe what this 
6 photograph shows? 
7 A So this is the right hand, we are looking 
8 at the palm surface and this is a tangential gunshot 
9 wound to the base of the right thumb. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
And what do you mean tangential? 
Meaning if the skin surface is like this, 
12 the bullet is kind of going in the same direction as 
13 the skin at that point. So it is basically, you've 
14 heard the term graze, I'm sure. I would beg to 
15 differ this is a little deeper. When I think graze, 
16 I think of something very close to the surface of 
17 the skin only, which we will see later in this case. 
18 But I think this would be, I prefer to call it 
19 tangential gunshot wound, meaning the bullet was 
20 kind of going in the same direction as the skin at 
21 that point. 
22 Q Now, you were just showing with your hand, 
23 you had your, at this point can you tell by looking 
24 at this the direction, if this injury was caused by 
25 a bullet, can you tell the direction the bullet was

1 traveling? 
2 A It is difficult in this image because we 
3 have to orient it differently. You will see through 
4 different photographs there are skin tags and that 
5 is what we use to tell the direction of fire in a 
6 tangential gunshot wound. In this image I would 
7 have a hard time telling. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Again, this image can't help a whole lot. 
10 You can see a little bit of skin tag kind of 
11 pointing in this direction and one on this side 
12 also. This still a little difficult based on this 
13 image. 
14 You will also have to keep in mind, 
15 again, the body has been embalmed. So as the skin 
16 starts to get tighter, it starts to change compared 
17 to first autopsy. 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
Have you ever done a second autopsy? 
In fact, we do a lot of second autopsies 
20 at Dover Air Force Base. A lot of the civilians 
21 that die overseas, they are going to get autopsies 
22 in sovereign countries and then they are going to 
23 come back to Dover and do a second autopsy, so we 
24 see a lot of these. 
25 Q

The next picture. This is the same injury

1 to the right hand and there is a scale that is 
2 placed over the wound to give it perspective, is 
3 that fair to say? 
4 A Exactly. We do this for any gunshot 
5 wound, that is standard. You can start to see 
6 another tag coming into the field here again, it 
7 starts to point in that direction, not as good as I 
8 would like. 
9 Q All right. And the next image? 
10 A So in this image we have the posterior 
11 surface, an anatomic position, this is actually the 
12 anterior surface. I'm sure this has been 
13 demonstrated, right? So anatomic position is like 
14 this, standing straight ahead, palms facing forward. 
15 Okay. 
16 This is actually confusingly the 
17 anterior surface of the right forearm and that's an 
18 exit gunshot wound right there. 
19 We can also see that tangential 
20 gunshot wound to the thumb also in this image. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
And the next image. 
Is just close-up image here of the exit 
23 wound on the anterior surface of right forearm. 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
All right. 
Here we are moving up a little bit closer

1 into the axilla. Basically still on his back and we 
2 are taking a picture here of the back of his arm 
3 here close to his armpit. So this is actually an 
4 exit gunshot wound. If I hold my arm out like this, 
5 it is right about in this location here. 
6 (indicating) 
7 Q Now, let me ask you, Dr. , is there 
8 any, this may sound silly for me to ask you this, is 
9 there any rhyme or reason as to the order which you 
10 document and photograph wounds? 
11 A There is, a lot of it's mechanics, right. 
12 Michael Brown wasn't a light person, you know, he 
13 was probably well over 250 pounds. It is difficult 
14 for us to continuously manipulate and turn him from 
15 front to back. 
16 So we try to take all the photographs 
17 when he is laying on the stomach, then flip him over 
18 and then take all the photographs from the other 
19 side. 
20 Q So when you talk about these wounds, we 
21 will see in your report later you might have them as 
22 numbered, or in this case the first wound you 
23 photographed and the second one you photographed, is 
24 there any, are you saying that those were the order 
25 in which the wounds were sustained?

1 A No, I'm not. This has nothing to do with 
2 the order of infliction of these wounds. This is 
3 just the order that we happen to photograph them at 
4 autopsy. 
5 Q All right. So you said that this is on 
6 the back, upper arm and that is an exit wound?

11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A

A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
And is this a gunshot wound? 
Correct, this is an exit gunshot wound. 
And then the next photograph? 
Just a closer up image of the same thing. 
And the next photograph? 
Okay. So now he's still laying on his 
14 stomach and now we have an image of the left forearm 
15 and we can see an injury here. I think if you go on
