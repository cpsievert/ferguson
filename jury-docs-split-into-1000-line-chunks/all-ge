Yes, it is. 
And I'm going to put this up here as well 
jurors can look at it and follow along. Can

1 have once again the examination 2014-5413. You have 
2 the heading, Supplemental Microscopic Examination 
3 Report. 
4 Then you have Microscopic Slide 
5 Examination, and then you have the body of the 
6 paragraph where I preface by saying tissue fragment. 
7 And then I say sections of the tissue 
8 fragment from the exterior surface of the police 
9 officer's motor vehicle. I say that because that's 
10 where I knew where it came from, so I'm just trying 
11 to give it a description so that if someone looks at 
12 this later on, this kind of identifies where I got 
13 the tissue from and also helps to remind me where it 
14 came from. 
15 Are consistent with a fragment of 
16 skin overlying soft tissue and then I put in 
17 parentheses connective tissue. So when I'm looking 
18 at this particular fragment there is characteristics 
19 of cutaneous skin that let me know histologically 
20 that it is skin as opposed to something mucosal. 
21 When I say mucosal, like the inner side of your lip, 
22 that's an epithelial surface, meaning the outer 
23 layer of cells that surfaces a lining, but it is a 
24 different type of tissue being that it is mucosal. 
25 The difference between mucosal and

1 actual true skin, there's something called a 
2 granular layer. On the histology, and when I was 
3 talking about like the stratum corneum, you have the 
4 granular layer and you have another layer, you have 
5 a basilar layer. All of these things are kind of in 
6 a continuum. 
7 A granular layer is specific to skin 
8 that's on the outside of a body, it is not mucosal. 
9 So this particular fragment that I'm looking at has 
10 a granular layer. 
11 Since I see that, that let's me know 
12 that it is definitely exterior skin and that's how I 
13 know it's skin. And then the next part where it 
14 says overlying soft connective, the skin surface 
15 sits like on the level and beneath that you have a 
16 supporting layer of tissue. The supporting layer of 
17 tissue is this connective tissue layer that I'm 
18 talking about here. 
19 Then I say there are features of 
20 desiccation/drying artifact. This particular piece 
21 of tissue that I had that was, you know, was sitting 
22 outside on a car door for an extended period of time 
23 before, let me back up. 
24 Before I got a chance to put it in 
25 formalin, it has been exposed to air, other type of

1 things that can cause it to dry out, that's all 
2 desiccation means. It is kind of an artifactual 
3 change of it drying out, not being put in 
4 preservative, that would kind of halt or stop that 
5 process. 
6 So for an extended period of time, I 
7 don't know how long it took before it got to me, but 
8 those features are there, it is hardened, it dried. 
9 I can appreciate those changes under the microscope. 
10 Those changes under the microscope look like little 
11 circles or kind of like pockets of air, kind of 
12 looks like swish cheese, in a way to think how the 
13 little pockets of swish cheese are. That's cause 
14 the tissue has kind of been affected by these drying 
15 changes and causes that artifactual change on my 
16 slides, so that's what I'm talking about right 
17 there. 
18 Then I say there is a granular layer 
19 present within the upper layer of the stratified 
20 squamous epithelium. 
21 So that granular layer that I just 
22 spoke to you about, that's how I definitively know 
23 that this is a skin sample from the outer surface of 
24 the body skin surface. 
25 And the stratified squamous

1 epithelium is just how I as a pathologist describe 
2 this particular type of skin set. There is 
3 different types, but this particular type that you 
4 have on your skin is known as stratified squamous 
5 epithelium, so it is just a name. 
6 So focally, lightly pigmented 
7 keratinocytes are present within the basal layer of 
8 the stratified squamous epithelium. 
9 So that's just going back to what I 
10 was telling you before, you have that relationship 
11 between the melanocytes, who are responsible for 
12 making pigment. They give that pigment up to this 
13 keratinocyte, who holds onto it and eventually over 
14 time, you know, they will migrate up and disappear. 
15 But this particular cell type is not, 
16 it is present, but it is not overly pigmented. So 
17 it was important for me to describe that to maybe 
18 suggest potentially where this piece of tissue may 
19 have come from and that's what I'm saying in 
20 essence. 
21 Q Okay. I'm not even going to try to 
22 summarize that because I can't pronounce half the 
23 things you just said. I'm passing out copies of 
24 your two supplemental reports to the grand jurors

3 questions for Dr. ?

Q 
A 
Q 
(By Ms. Whirley) Hi, Dr. 
Hi, how you doing. 
Are you able to tell regarding the handle, 
7 how the injury occurred. For instance, whether he 
8 was grabbing the gun, shot went off and hurt his 
9 hand or if he was trying to block the weapon or stop 
10 him from shooting him, can you give any insight into 
11 that? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
No, I cannot. 
Why is that? 
Due to the nature of the wound, really all 
15 the information in my report is saying is that it is 
16 helping me with a distance. How far away this gun 
17 was discharged when this wound was generated. So 
18 other than the fact knowing it is a tangential graze 
19 wound and it is a wound of close range, I can't say 
20 any more about it because the information that I 
21 have, that's all it is telling me. 
22 I thought 
23 before, if you could remind us, do you know the 
24 direction in which the wound, the gunshot would have 
25 entered?

1 A So when I was telling you guys before 
2 there's, when you get, not all the time, but with 
3 graze wounds you can get injury called skin tags or 
4 you get these little projections of tissue that 
5 point a particular way. 
6 So in a situation for Mr. Michael 
7 Brown, the skin tags were going in an upward, let me 
8 back up. When I do my diagram, it is like this, 
9 anatomical position, you are like this. So with his 
10 wound --
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Would this help? This is a 
12 picture that I am using, which was taken during the 
13 autopsy and it is in the packet of Grand Jury 
14 Exhibit Number 7, and it is Image Number 49. If it 
15 is easier, you want me to turn the lights down? 
16 A Yeah. The tips of Mr. Michael Brown's 
17 fingers will be out here. That's my hand 
18 manipulating his hand. So those skin tags I'm 
19 talking about kind of look like little shark teeth, 
20 these are the little skin tags I'm talking about. 
21 These tags are pointing this direction, they're 
22 point that way. 
23 So the barrel of the gun points 
24 towards the tags. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. ALIZADEH: So let me do this. I'm

1 using my hand as a gun. So would the barrel be in 
2 this 
3 A The barrel is in that position and the 
4 bullet is going in that path just like that, that's 
the way it is going. (indicating) 5 
6 So when I put it on a body diagram, 
7 I'm like this. It's going in an upwards fashion. 
8 It doesn't mean it is going upwards, but that's the 
9 way that I have to present it to give a reference 
10 point of the injuries on a body diagram. 
11 But what it is saying in realtime is 
12 the hand can be positioned in all kind of fashions, 
13 but that gun barrel is going to have to stay like 
14 that. It has to be coming in a fashion like this. 
15 It can't change, it can't start coming this way, it 
16 can't. It has to always be in relationship like 
17 this. (indicating) 
18 Where the hand could have been like 
19 that generating the wound, the hand could have been 
20 like this generating the wound, and it could have 
21 been like this generating the wound, but they have 
22 to stay in this locked position, that's the only way 
23 it can be. (indicating) 
24 How long from the first 
25 examination to the further examination that you did,

1 how long of a time was it that you got those 
2 samples? You said you put them in a preservative 
3 liquid. 
4 A Uh-huh. 
5 Was there any 
6 deterioration or anything from the time when you 
7 received it until you did the second examination? 
8 
9 
A So in terms of processing that tissue, so 
I did the examination on August lOth. I immediately 
10 took samples, I cut little pieces out with scissors 
11 from kind of randomly around this area where it is 
12 kind of discolored. That's the area that I'm most 
13 suspicious for, concern for, for some type of 
14 particular matter or deposition of foreign material. 
15 I cut those out and immediately put 
16 them in preservative solution of the formalin as 
17 soon as I took them off that day. 
Okay. 18 
19 A Once they go in that solution, no more 
20 desiccation, nor more changing, nothing else is 
21 going to happen to it with the histology that I did 
22 of this wound. 
23 That other tissue didn't get a chance 
24 to go into formalin immediately. I don't know where 
25 it sat, it could have been in a cooler or an air

1 room temperature room, I don't know, but it didn't 
2 get into formalin until I got it until weeks later 
3 after the event occurred when it was given to me. 
4 That couldn't affect the 
5 way the particulates appear? 
6 A Just to make sure we are talking about the 
7 same specimen. For the things that I took here, 
8 once I put those into the solution, they are going 
9 to be preserved and nothing is going to be altered. 
10 Okay. That was the other 
11 thing, wasn't it, I'm sorry. 
12 A So once it goes into that tissue, I'm 
13 sorry, once it goes into that liquid, then goes to 
14 my histology lab and then, you know, through a 
15 series of steps before it gets put in that wax. 
16 So the tissue you got 
17 from the hand was preserved right away? 
18 A Correct. 
19 I just want to clarify

13 going to call it that for right now. I know that we 
14 see that the hand, the hand palm is upright. 
15 Michael was almost 300 pounds and when he fell, 
16 could his hand have hit and moved and embedded dirt 
17 in there. Is there any way that that could be

5 You don't know that it

10 in that sample? 
11 
12 
A No, I did not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: When you examine the right 
13 hand and in particular the palm of Michael Brown and 
14 not just the wound, but the entire palm, did you see 
15 any dirt or debris on his, on the palm of his hand. 
16 A When I examined, the only area of 
17 discoloration that I was concerned of being 
18 something, I guess, not native to his hand was right 
19 here in this region. The rest of his hand is clean. 
20 You can see it is a normal palmer hand except when 
21 you get into this area associated with the wound.

1 flexibility in what you want to take, but standard 
2 specimens that I take on a full examination pretty 
3 much every time I always take some type of blood, I 
4 try to preface where it is coming from. I take 
5 urine and I also take vitreous fluids, which is 
6 fluid from the eyes, and I take liver and I take 
7 brain. 
8 I have to specifically tell the tox 
9 lab to test the brain and the liver if I'm concerned 
10 or worried about substances being in those organs. 
11 So for this particular case, the substances that 
12 were generated were active and metabolites of 
13 marijuana. 
14 Those particular things are found in 
15 the blood and it is not necessary to correlate them 
16 to the brain or the liver. The blood samples are 
17 going to give an accurate representation of the 
18 levels that were in his body at the time of his

1 possibility that, you know, it is conceivable. 
Page 51 
It 
2 is possible that the hand is in a certain position 
3 when something goes off. We know it is a graze 
4 wound, it didn't stay, so it had to go someplace. 
5 Could it have went into the door? Could it have 
6 reentered another area on his body? Could it have 
7 just went out into another place in space? All of 
8 those things are reasonable and I can't definitively 
9 say because I wasn't there to actually see the 
10 positioning of how the body was when it happened. 
11 It's possible, there is a multitude 
12 of ways that the bullet could have traveled after it 
13 struck the skin. 
14 Thank you. 
15 When I 
16 look at that wound, it looks to me there is a lot of 
17 tissue missing yet only one small piece of tissue 
18 was recovered. Is that maybe an illusion there is 
19 not a lot of tissue missing, more like where it 
20 opens up you could put it back? 
21 A That's a possible thing where it is kind 
22 of more like filet and just kind of split open. 
23 It's tracking deep, muscle is more, I guess, firm 
24 for lack of a better word. So the more firm, the 
25 more it is going to kind of split.

2 So it is hard to say that something, 
3 pieces get scattered around or whatnot, but from 
4 what you can see, there is definitely a track 
5 traveling through deeper into that muscle that you

1 between it and pushed things to the side. It is 
2 just open like that because the muscle, that's just 
3 what muscle kind of does once it gets hit. Because 
4 your muscles are in a bundle, it is like a fascicle. 
5 You have tissue that kind of holds them together. 
6 So when you injure that, they just 
7 kind of fall out. So that is going to make a wound 
8 that may not necessarily be, you have a little small 
9 bullet, but it goes through and filets that stuffs 
10 open, the integrity of the tissue elements has been 
11 disrupted. So now things are going to be able to 
12 kind of flop out. You no longer have the skin 
13 holding things together, you don't have connective 
14 tissue holding muscle together, that stuff's 
15 disrupted, it is going to flop open. 
16 I'm also too, I'm putting traction on 
17 the hand too, and that's going to help to expose it

19 your hand, your hand kind of just rest like this, 
20 I'm stretching it out like that. So that could make 
21 things look more dramatic than they really are. 
22 One more question, 
23 But the mucusy substance found on the door

1 That's the way it was 
2 presented to us at the beginning, that's why I refer 
3 to it that way. It is consistent, you found it to 
4 be consistent with this part of the hand probably? 
5 
6 
A It could be. I don't know definitively. 
Right. But the 
7 pigmentation, the keratin that's in here is 
8 consistent with either something with a lighter tone 
9 skin, it wouldn't be from this part of the hand and 
10 the arm? 
11 A Right. 
12 It could be here or back 
13 here or the foot or whatever? 
14 A It needs to be a lightly pigmented area. 
15 That's the one that was 
16 affected? 
17 A That's the best spot I got, but I don't 
18 know exactly where it came from. There is no test I 
19 can do that says this is hands, this came from the 
20 hand, you know. 
21 I understand. I wasn't 
22 trying to lock you into corner there. 
23 Pretty 
24 scientific, seems like here's a little bit of art,

1 evidence is telling you. With that being said, 
2 obviously, going to hear from the federal, I guess, 
3 medical examiner? 
4 A Yes. 
5 What are your expectations 
6 across multiple medical examiners should we expect 
7 all of those reports be primarily very much the same 
8 or major parts would be the same? 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I hold off right now on 
10 his answer, we have a juror that needs to use the 
11 restroom. Anybody need to go? I don't want to stop 
12 it. 
13 (Recess) 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: We took a quick break. 
15 This is Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley's present, 
16 all 12 grand jurors. We just took like less than a 
17 five minute break for a couple bathroom breaks.

Dr. is still testifying 
Dr. , you are still under oath, of course. 
And then the court reporter, , is taking down 
21 and recording what is being said and 
22 had posed a question to Dr. Do you have 
23 anything, did I interrupt your question or were you 
24 done with that? 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. Mr. , do you recall his

Grand Jury Volume XX November 6, 20 14 
Page 56 
1 question? 
2 A Yes, I recall his question and it is a 
3 good question. Urn, you know, I guess in my, I have 
4 to be honest with you guys, I have never been in a 
5 experience like this before. I've only been doing 
6 my craft, I guess on my own, for a little over two 
7 years. I haven't been involved in any really high 
8 profile cases. This is my second time coming to a 
9 grand jury, so this is all, you know, kind of new 
10 for me and I will always be learning throughout my 
11 life dealing with experiences and whatnot. 
12 But in terms of having people come 
13 behind me to do an autopsy after I did it? When I 
14 initially first started out on this, I didn't know 
15 
16 
it could become what it is going to become. I was 
just working. That Sunday was my day to work. I 
17 got my caseload, things I was going to do that day. 
18 And I approach all my cases the same way every time 
19 based off of the training that I got and I just 
20 approach them the same way every time. 
21 I don't, you know, if there is little 
22 special things I'm concerned about. I pursue those, 
23 I do that, but I usually have the same approach 
24 every time. 
25 So knowing that someone is going to

1 come behind me, I've never had people come behind me 
2 before. I was a little nervous about it, but I know 
3 that I approach this in a logical fashion and I 
4 wouldn't have done anything different. 
5 So that being said, when people come 
6 behind you, the work that we do at the end of the 
7 day it is an opinion. There can be a difference of 
8 opinion, but as long as, you know, everyone, once 
9 everything is documented, you know, when someone 
10 says this is an end, this is an out. You know, this 
11 is an entrance wound, this is an exit wound. Well, 
12 this looks close range, blah, blah, blah. 
13 Once you get all of that kind of down 
14 on the table, you get all the facts out there, then 
15 at that point people start to say well, okay, this 
16 is what I think this is. 
17 Will somebody potentially look at my 
18 slides and say, oh, that's dirt, they can. But you 
19 have to understand is you have to, you can't look at 
20 these things in a vacuum, you know. 
21 Each piece is important for me not 
22 physically being there, I have the body, I have the 
23 evidence, I have to have all of these things to be 
24 able to generate my opinion. I think you have to 
25 look at everything in totality. You can't just take

1 a snapshot. You can do my job and do it in a vacuum 
2 and some come up with all kind of conclusions, but 
3 what you have to do is you have to look at 
4 everything and then you have to look at the person 
5 who was telling you, I mean, if the person is 
6 credible to you and like I say, I'm not here 
7 promoting one thing or another, I'm just speaking to 
8 the things that I observed. And for lack of a 
9 better term, regurgitating them back out with my 
10 level of medical training to try to make sense of 
11 everything. 
12 People can come in and say whatever 
13 they want to say for whatever their agenda is and I 
14 think people need to be aware of that. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: That brings up some good 
16 points that I wanted to maybe clarify with you. 
17 Have you, Doctor, ever performed a second 
18 autopsy? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
No, I have not. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And you said you've 
21 never had anybody perform a second autopsy after 
22 you? 
23 A No. 
24 Q Are you aware of what the proper protocol 
25 would be if a second autopsy would be performed

1 regarding what that second doctor may need in order 
2 to complete his findings, do you know? I don't want 
3 you to guess. 
4 A I have personal feelings about it what you 
5 may need, but I don't know is there a standard 
6 protocol, what someone is supposed to get when they 
7 do a second autopsy, I do not know the exact answer 
8 to that. 
9 Q Okay. So in your profession in your job, 
10 you were tasked with examining the body and 
11 determining the manner of death, the cause of death, 
12 and documenting and describing any defects or wounds 
13 of the body and testifying perhaps about the affects 
14 of those wounds and preparing a report which you did 
15 in this case? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q Now, you just said that when you went in 
18 on the lOth to do this autopsy, you approached this 
19 in the same manner that you would any autopsy that 
20 you are going to do; is that right? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
You didn't do this any differently because 
23 it was Michael Brown? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, I did not. 
Did you even know at that time you had

1 just said, you didn't know that this would become 
2 what it has become? 
3 A No, I did not. 
4 Q And are you familiar with Dr. , do 
5 you know him? 
6 A Yes, I do. 
7 Q Do you have an opinion as to whether or 
8 not he is a reputable or respected pathologist? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
I have no comment. 
Okay. How about have you seen a report 
11 from Dr. ? 
12 A I have not seen a report from him on this 
13 case. 
14 Q And now you're aware that there was a 
15 third autopsy done; is that right? 
16 A Yes, I am. 
17 Q That was done by Medical Examiners with 
18 the Department of Defense? 
A Correct. 
Q And you are aware that one of those 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
doctors was Major , go you not? 
A Yes, I am. 
Q Now, prior to this case, had you ever 
24 heard of Dr. 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, I have not.

And you have since met him; is that right? 
Yes, I have. 
When you met him, was it in relation to 
Yes. 
Okay. And have you seen his report? 
No, I have not. 
Okay. So you can't today testify to any 
9 other findings by other professionals, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But you do recognize that very competent 
12 and reputable experts may differ in their opinions? 
13 A Correct. 
14 Q And you've testified just regarding your 
15 opinion in this? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q All right. And we'll hear from Dr. 
18 and hopefully Dr. in the future. 
19 In order to do the things that I told 
20 you, you are tasked with doing in this case so that 
21 you testified, did you have to examine Officer 
22 Wilson's vehicle? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

Did you do that?

1 Q Did you have to see the crime scene 
2 photos? 
3 A I've seen them, but they weren't necessary 
4 to do my autopsy. 
5 Q Okay. Did you see them after you had 
6 performed the autopsy?

8 Q 
9 report? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Did you see them after you prepared your 
Yes. 
Okay. Urn, how about the medical records 
12 of police officer Darren Wilson, did you need to see 
13 those in order for you to form an opinion? 
14 A No. 
15 Q And how about the clothing of Officer 
16 Darren Wilson, did you need to see those things in 
17 order for you to form your opinions? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No. 
What about, now, of course you had the 
20 clothing of Michael Brown; is that correct? 
21 A I don't have it, but I saw it at the time 
22 of the autopsy and then I gave it over to the St. 
23 Louis County Police Department as evidence. 
24 Q And would it be, in your opinion, was it 
25 helpful to have the clothing to at least see perhaps

1 if there were defects or holes in the clothing that 
2 would correspond with injuries? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Was there anything, so you have the body 
5 of Michael Brown, you have the clothing of Michael 
6 Brown you, of course, did not have the toxicology 
7 results when you did your report? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And was there anything else that you had 
10 that you relied upon in making your reports? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
The x-rays. 
X-rays of the body, correct. And we have 
13 those on a disc that we didn't show those to you, 
14 but I indicated if you needed to see them or ask any 
15 questions about them they would be available. 
16 Anything else that you needed to form 
17 your ultimate conclusions? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No. 
Is there anything that you didn't have you 
20 wish you'd had? 
21 A At this particular time, no, I can't think 
22 of anything. 
23 Q What about the gun of Officer Wilson, the 
24 gun that was used in the shooting, did you need to 
25 have that or examine that to make your findings?
