8 means that the casing was not fully extracted from 
9 the chamber and the gun did not cycle properly. 
10 Q And is it possible, again, we will have a 
11 firearms expert testifying about this, has that ever 
12 happened to you? 
13 A At the range, yes. I mean, it is a 
14 malfunction that is not common, but it does occur. 
15 Q And so if there would be something 
16 blocking that cartridge from flying out of that 
17 ejection port, it could be stuck inside partially in 
18 and out of the weapon, correct? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And if that were to occur, would you be 
21 able to discharge another round with that 
22 projectile, that cartridge still partially in that 
23 ejection port? 
24 A No. And also when that casing is 
25 stovepiped, it allowed, the gun is out of battery,

1 which means it won't cycle again. So you would have 
2 to clear the malfunction, and there's a drill that 
3 they train us on of how you would have to clear the 
4 stovepipe, the round. 
5 I'm This 
6 is going back to the time that you arrived at the 
7 Ferguson Police Department to speak with Officer 
8 Wilson, Darren Wilson. And at the time you said he 
9 showed you where his gun, where he says that his gun 
10 was contained in his package. 
11 A Uh-huh. 
12 Can you describe that 
13 package for us? 
14 A I can. It is a manila envelope, which is, 
15 I'd probably say 9 by 13 size, and what it looked 
16 like is I didn't see if it was sealed because the 
17 way it was positioned on the table is that the flap, 
18 I guess for it, was positioned down, if that makes 
19 sense. 
20 Yeah, that is what I 
21 wanted to know. 
22 
23 
A Sure. 
I need clarification if it 
24 was sealed or not. And from the time of the 
25 incident until the time that Officer Darren Wilson

1 was transported to Christian Northwest to document 
2 his injuries or whatever, can you give me some idea 
3 about how much time had elapsed from that point to 
4 the point that he arrived at the hospital? 
5 A Well, the only thing I could speak of is 
6 the time that we were notified at this point. I 
7 don't exactly know what time the incident occurred 
8 and what time he departed the scene, it wasn't part 
9 of my responsibility or my interview at the time. 
10 I know that we were notified at 
11 12:43. I arrived at 1:30 on scene and I first 
12 contacted Officer Darren Wilson at 2:00p.m. 
13 The conversation at Ferguson Police 
14 Department lasted minutes, not long at all and then 
15 he was transported to Christian Northwest Hospital. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: How long would you say, how 
17 much time did you spend with him at Christian 
18 Hospital. 
19 A I probably say 30 minutes. Obviously it 
20 took some time to get photos taken and then any time 
21 that either a registration nurse, a physician's 
22 assistant or nurse would enter the room, the 
23 interview would basically just stop for privacy 
24 reasons. That would be common practice even if it 
25 was a normal investigation.

1 So from 
2 the time that you finally left him at the hospital 
3 or whatever. 
4 A Uh-huh. 
5 Do you know about what 
6 time that was? 
7 A I probably say I left probably between 
8 2:45 and 3:00. From that point I returned back to 
9 the Ferguson Police Department. 
10 Yes, ma'am. 
11 During 
12 the scene, the time that the officer was still 
13 positioning his car, struggling with Mr. Brown, did 
14 he ever indicate that he was trying to call for 
15 help? 
16 A I'm sorry? 
17 Did he ever say that he 
18 was trying to call for help or backup? 
19 A He did not. He said that initially even 
20 before, as you put it the altercation took place, he 
21 says that he requested, advised the dispatcher he 
22 was conducting a pedestrian check and then he 
23 requested an assist car at that point before the 
24 confrontation at the vehicle ever took place. 
25 So when an officer in his

1 position will call for help, does he have a 
2 microphone here or radio dispatch on his waist? 
3 A In a later interview with Officer Wilson, 
4 we found that he keeps the radio on his right side. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: You are pointing to your 
6 left side? 
7 A I'm sorry, it is on his left side, I 
8 apologize. I'm sorry, on his, thank you, his left 
9 side. And then there would be a radio inside of the 
10 vehicle also. 
11 So still He 
12 gets out of the car and he tells him to halt, but he 
13 says the victim kept running. So at that time he 
14 still had not called for backup? 
15 A He says that as he's exiting the vehicle 
16 he announces shot fires and requested assistance at 
17 that point. That would be once he is getting out of 
18 the car. 
19 He's --
20 A I'm sorry? 
21 Did he fire once he got 
22 out of the car or did he call and then fire? 
23 A No, he, okay he, I'm trying to explain it 
24 to where. So essential what happens is after, he 
25 tells us that after the first shot that went off

1 while he was in the vehicle, the subject comes back 
2 in and assaults him and then takes off running east 
3 on Canfield away from the car. 
4 Uh-huh. 
5 A Officer Wilson then tells us that he opens 
6 his door and as he is exiting the vehicle, he gets 
7 on his radio and announces, or notifies his 
8 dispatcher of shots fired and requests an assist 
9 car. 
10 So at that point that would be his 
11 second, as he puts it, second radio transmission 
12 regarding this incident announcing where he 
13 announced shots fired and requested assistance at 
14 that point. 
15 So what did he say would 
16 be his reason to keep firing after he got out of the 
17 car and calling for help? 
18 A Okay, uh --
19 If the suspect is running, 
20 then what would be your initial reason to keep 
21 shooting? 
22 A As Darren Wilson describes it, the subject 
23 turned around at that point. He doesn't tell us 
24 that he fired any rounds from the time that he got 
25 out of the car to the time that the subject turns

1 around. He just announces on the radio that shots 
2 were fired. 
3 And from being a police officer as 
4 long as I have, that's the same thing as an officer 
5 needs aid, requesting immediate assistance, if you 
6 hear, you are a neighboring police officer and you 
7 hear any police officer and yell shots fired, that 
8 means that obviously something bad has happened. 
9 I guess 
10 at the point where Michael Brown turned around, did 
11 Officer Darren Wilson, did he indicate he had any 
12 injuries? 
13 A He doesn't, he doesn't say. Are you 
14 talking about Officer Wilson or the subject? 
15 The subject. 
16 A He doesn't say nor do I ask. He just says 
17 he turns around and then the hand goes to the right 
18 side of his waistband. He never says that he saw 
19 any injuries on the subject nor did, like I said, 
20 nor did I ask. 
21 After the shot 
22 was fired in the car, you said he saw blood on his 
23 hand. Was Officer Wilson referring to his own hand 
24 or Michael Brown's hand? 
25 A He was referring to his own hands. So

1 that's when he says, he tells me that he didn't know 
2 if he was injured, as far as he being Officer 
3 Wilson, or the subject was injured. He didn't know, 
4 he just saw the blood. 
5 You said you've 
6 investigated several officer shootings, is it 
7 typical that prior to your arrival, that the officer 
8 already has a lawyer there? 
9 A It can happen. I mean, it does happen on 
10 certain occasions and it would not impede us or 
11 change anything with the way we proceed. I mean, we 
12 would ask every police officer, just like we ask 
13 every victim or every witness or every suspect, if 
14 they would be interested in having a conversation or 
15 if they would be okay with an interview. 
16 And we just assume that the attorney 
17 would and with what happened is, his attorney sat 
18 there and didn't say a word. 
19 And this case there isn't 
20 say, for instance, Ferguson Police Department, there 
21 isn't a lawyer staffed in the building readily 
22 available, it would have been just like anyone else, 
23 it would have been called in on Saturday, I imagine?

12 A Yes. 
13 You said the casing is

19 It cannot be discharged

21 
22 
A The gun doesn't have to be taken apart.

1 magazine, lock the slide to the rear, which would 
2 remove the stovepipe round and the round that was 
3 somewhat forced into the chamber, or the barrel of 
4 the gun. You would have to reinsert the magazine 
5 and then put the slide forward and that would 
6 chamber another round.

8 too, if a weapon does stovepipe, to clear that

10 If a gun was, if a weapon 
11 was, a shot was fired inside the car that there 
12 would be a spent casing inside the car or could it

15 window. 
16 The window that's in

18 A Yes, it could have, in just my experience, 
19 casings could end up in very odd places. It will 
20 eject, and it could bounce off something, you know, 
21 there is plenty of obstructions inside of a car, any

1 kind of that way for a reason. They are 4 feet by 
2 6 feet. And with just one interviewer and a person 
3 being interviewed, is very tight. 
4 So with two detectives, a person 
5 being interviewed and their attorney, that room, 
6 those rooms are just not conducive for that type, 
7 the amount of people. 
8 So the room that we chose to use is a 
9 small conference room with a table and about six 
10 chairs that are around it. So it was more 
11 accommodating, we would use that option if we needed 
12 it on any interview.

8 which time his weapon was seized and it was in that 
9 evidence envelope or that manila envelope that we 
10 had talked about earlier. So that's when the weapon 
11 and uniform were seized. 
12 Following that, I did return to the 
13 scene there on Canfield Green Apartment Complex. 
14 The reason for that is, goes hand in hand with our 
15 cursory interview. The way I explained it earlier 
16 is that with the information that I obtained through 
17 the cursory interview, I provide that to Detective 
18 so that it will allow the members of the 
19 police department at the scene to make sure we have 
20 encompassed everything that might be involved. 
21 So they have a statement that will 
22 either, you know, if they need to look over here for 
23 evidence or over there, they know based on the 
24 cursory statement. We would do that with any 
25 witness or anybody that could give us any

1 information, we'll use that to, influence is the 
2 wrong word, make us look in the right spot, if you 
3 understand what I'm saying, I'm sorry. 
4 
5 A Yes. 
6 Do you feel that the way 
7 the weapon was handled before it got to your St. 
8 Louis County investigator, compromised the 
9 investigation in any way? 
10 A No, it is just different than what St. 
11 Louis County would do. However, chain of custody 
12 was maintained and that's really the only thing that 
13 would be important to me as an investigator that it 
14 went from Officer Darren Wilson, to Detective 
15 to Detective those are 
16 the chains that, obviously, I would be concerned 
17 about. It appeared that it was maintained, so. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: And also looking at my 
19 notes I neglected to ask, you've mentioned that you 
20 investigated a number of police officer involved 
21 shootings? 
22 
23 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And have you interviewed 
24 the police officers involved in those shootings? 
25 A On some of them.

MS. ALIZADEH: This is the 16th of 
12 September, the time is approximately 1:16. This is 
13 Kathi Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office. 
14 Present are all 12 jury grand jurors, as well as the 
15 court reporter, Sheila Whirley has stepped out. 
16 To begin the afternoon session what I 
17 would first like to do is to play an audio file that 
18 is contained on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 17. 
19 Remember, this is one of those I renumbered. I 
20 think it used to be 9 or 10, but anyway, it is now 
21 Grand Jury Number 17. I'm going to play a recording 
22 of an interview of Darren Wilson and the interview I 
23 have transcripts that I'm going to pass out. 
24 Again, if you will to take one and put 
25 your juror number in the corner. Before I actually

1 start this, this interview is the interview that 
2 talked about that was recorded in a 
3 conference room at the police headquarters. 
4 And so as you can see from the transcript, 
5 the main speakers are Detective and in the 
6 transcript that is DET. and then when Darren 
7 responds it is D. Wilson. 
8 
9 They both have the distinctive voices 
10 and hopefully it won't be to confusing for you to 
11 tell who is speaking. 
12 Also during the interview you will hear 
13 that they give Darren Wilson a map to write on and 
14 then also a photo lineup that they ask him if he can 
15 identify somebody. 
16 So that happens later in the interview. 
17 I'm going to let you guys look at those and I can 
18 put them up on the screen if you like, but those are 
19 what is being referenced when they are talking and 
20 those are copies.

3 And also, I'm going to tell you because we 
4 have another witness that's here that we need to 
5 meet with briefly, and Sheila and I both need to do 
6 that, I'm going to start this and I'm going to walk 
7 out. I would ask that you not deliberate or 
8 anything while I'm gone because is still here 
9 and he's going to just be present while this is 
10 being played and then if we're not back in 30 
11 minutes, which I can't imagine it is going to take 
12 30 minutes, when we come back we'll stop it. If it 
13 stops before, then we'll just, said he would 
14 then just leave the room so he is not sitting here 
15 alone with you all. 
16 If by chance we're not 
17 back when this ends, you know it will start over 
18 from the beginning automatically, so you can just 
19 click the pause or that square to stop it. 
20 (This is the audio recording being played 
21 at this time.) 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: Is there any part of this 
23 that you all want to hear again or hear it again in 
24 its totality? And again, this is available for you

I'm not going to get into a law school

15 FBI agents involved and the attorneys are either 
16 with the U.S. Attorney's office or Department of 
17 Justice kind of agreed to work together with the
