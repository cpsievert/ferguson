3 When you left the store, I 
4 thought it was strange you guys stuck together. You 
5 didn't seem concerned, then kind of something bad 
6 was there, then you kind of stuck with Mike, kind of 
7 walk down the street, see the cops coming knowing 
8 they might be coming for me, I would expect probably 
9 more hide behind the bush, get back in place. What 
10 is the reason you walked down the street waiting for 
11 the cops to come get you? 
12 A Like I said, that was in my mind at the 
13 time, we're not running, there is nothing really to 
14 hide behind on West Florissant. We could have run 
15 behind the stores, we still had to get out in the 
16 open eventually to get down Canfield. In the mind 
17 walking from Ferguson Market to Canfield, we're 
18 never making it to Canfield. We're never making it 
19 to Canfield how far this store is, to how many 
20 police cars we see on a day, you know, that's just 
21 in the area, we'll never make it to Canfield. 
22 You know, just seems 
23 strange to be in the middle of the street, you think 
24 on the sidewalk to kind of avoid being noticed. 
25 A In my mind, I'm still trying to fathom

1 everything that is going on and why he didn't put 
2 the Cigarillos in his pocket. He still had them in 
3 his hand the whole time leaving out the store, all 
4 the way walking down Canfield Drive. 
5 When the police officer 
6 backed up at you, obviously, very aggressive. You 
7 think he intended to hit you, you think it was a 
8 miscalculation on the part of his judgment what he 
9 thinks, I shouldn't ask it that way, but I'm just 
10 trying to, I mean, that's pretty aggressive if you 
11 felt like you had to literally get out of the way to 
12 avoid him hitting you, if you felt that way? 
13 A Yes, correct. It was very aggressive and 
14 fast the way he pulled back, but because we heard 
15 the tires, we was able to step back almost a second 
16 before the truck, the back of the rear of it kind of 
17 hit us, so it didn't hit us, but the way his car was 
18 angled, it very well could have hit both of us. 
19 Just a 
20 quick follow-up question. Is it typical for you to 
21 walk down the middle of the street when you went to 
22 the market or walk around the neighborhood. 
23 A No, sir. I walked in the middle of the 
24 street before, but it is not like I just wake up in 
25 the morning, hey, we are going to walk in the middle

1 of the street. It is something you do, you are 
2 crossing the street and try to stay a little longer 
3 or you just walking down the sidewalk. It wasn't 
4 planned to walk in the street. 
5 Typically you would be on 
6 the sidewalk? 
7 A Correct. 
8 In my mind an act of 
9 defiance going down the middle of the street 
10 expecting cars to go around you and, you know, pay 
11 attention to you. If I see somebody in the middle 
12 of the street I'd be concerned about hitting them 
13 and really slowing down and moving over. 
14 A Yeah, that's correct. 
15 I would interpret that 
16 they are being defiant to show strength or 
17 something. 
18 A Correct, walking down the middle of the 
19 street could, you know, cause harm if someone had 
20 to, but like I said, walking down the middle of the 
21 street we saw two, three, maybe even four cars pass 
22 us and no one blew their horn, no one even stopped 
23 or slowed down. They kept the same speed and just 
24 rolled right passed us.

1 Like I said, you can see directly 
2 across coming out of my building, this building that 
3 he was standing with a friend, Building Number 
4 Big Mike. They were standing on the third floor 
5 also. 
6 That morning when I came out, I could 
7 see him, Big Mike right about right here helping 
8 someone put kids in the car. 
9 
10 Q 
The guy who I was going to --
(By Ms. Whirley) Let me stop you a minute. 
11 When you indicate where Big Mike is, could you put 
12 BM or MB, either one, so we can keep track of who is 
13 who. This is him too, right?

Okay. 
I don't know if you can see it. And this 
19 is Big Mike. Now initially when I first met him he 
20 was staying a little further back in Northwinds. At 
21 the time of the incident he was staying here at the 
22 time, something was going on with his grandmother, 
23 he had to move out, and he was staying with a 
24 friend. 
25 When I came out that morning, he was

1 down in the parking lot area. Now the guy I was 
2 going to go to for the Cigarillos, stayed in this 
3 building right here Number Like I said, 
4 regardless whether I saw him or not, I was passing 
5 this building, that's the way I walk through to go 
6 to the guy. 
7 When I saw him, we had our words, 
8 we're going to match, now we are walking up. 
9 Now this is where we are going 
10 towards the store, going up Canfield. Now back to 
11 the part where the officer pulled up on us. 
12 One is the leasing office, the first 
13 building. We were pretty much, we didn't get on 
14 into the street until we were like right before the 
15 leasing office, so it had to be right here where we 
16 initially just crossed over into the street. 
17 Now, when the street, the officer 
18 doesn't pull up on us until about right here is 
19 where the police officer first really pulled up on 
20 the side of us. 
21 After he initially said get on the 
22 sidewalk, we got to about, I say we wasn't really 
23 that far away from him, we got to about right here.

1 destination, you keep walking east? 
2 A Yes, we were still walking, but eventually 
3 I figure we were going to get out of the street. 
4 So you were 
5 right there at Copper Creek Road and he said get the 
6 F on the sidewalk? 
7 A Yes. 
8 You said not but a 
9 minute, you kept walking, you didn't hesitate, you 
10 didn't even do anything except we are almost home? 
11 A Yes, that is what I told the officer. We 
12 are a minute away from our destination, I'll be out 
13 of the street shortly. At this time Big Mike said 
14 nothing, no words were out of his mouth towards the 
15 officer. 
16 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Let me stop you for a 
17 minute. Your destination would be like, show us 
18 where you were when you told the officer you are 
19 almost at your destination, this goes to one of the 
20 grand juror questions. 
21 A This leasing office where we are at. This 
22 is where the officer stopped us. He asked us to get 
23 on the sidewalk, I told him we were going to our 
24 destination. This is where I was headed, this is

2 actually see both our buildings from standing right 
3 there, there is no real big trees or anything, they 
4 were actually cutting trees down in the 
5 neighborhood.

A 
Is there something wrong? 
Yeah, I'm sorry, like I said, because of

19 to me, so much actually happened. 
20 Q Are we right with the location as far as 
21 when, where he stopped you? 
22 A Where he stops us, yes. I really can't 
23 tell how far we got down like the distance he had to 
24 drive in reverse, but I know he had to drive in 
25 reverse.

1 The front of his car never met us, 
2 the back of his car met us first when he came back. 
3 I'm describing from the distance because where he 
4 was shot was down here, Big Mike was shot down here 
5 in this area.

1 on both sides. I'll put another rectangle, but his 
2 rear was more on the side where he was coming from 
3 and kind of like, the beginning of his front was on 
4 the other side. Either way cars couldn't come this 
5 way or go the other way. They were stuck, and at 
6 that moment that's when these three cars were 
7 standing right there. And like I said, me and Big 
8 Mike, we are standing on this side of the police 
9 cruiser car. 
10 Now, when he pulls up on us and he 
11 said, what did you say? I could tell that he's mad 
12 then, that's when he tried to open his door. Like I 
13 said, the way I was standing on the side of Big Mike 
14 when he opened his door, we was so close to his door 
15 that it hit us, but more so it hit Big Mike, only 
16 like a little portion of me, maybe the end of the 
17 door, it didn't really hurt me or anything like 
18 that, but it struck us and it closed back on the 
19 officer. 
20 At that time is when his arm came out 
21 the window and he grabbed onto Big Mike. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
(By Ms. Whirley) Okay. 
Any other questions or should I continue?

1 A The door hit me on my left side, left arm,

8 the store clerk made a move like he was going 
9 towards, like I said, the first time before the 
10 store clerk actually tried to grab for Big Mike 
11 because the first initial grab the store clerk just 
12 grabbed the door and Big Mike just pushed the door.

18 something to the officer as the officer pulled away, 
19 could have said something ignorant to him? 
20 A No way, no, ma'am. He was standing behind 
21 me, he was so close if he would have said something, 
22 I would have heard. He didn't say anything, like I 
23 said at that time only I spoke to the officer. 
24 Now, I could kind of see where he may 
25 have been looking at the officer, kind of staring

6 Did you see that or you just speculating? 
7 A I am speculating right now. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: We want you to tell us what 
9 you know, what you saw. 
10 A I was looking at the officer because I was 
11 talking to the officer. I wasn't directly looking 
12 into his eyes, so much looking at his face and 
13 telling him what was going on, but at no point in 
14 time I heard Big Mike say anything at all, he never 
15 said anything. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: But the officer said, what 
17 did you say? That kind of sounds like he heard 
18 something. 
19 A Or he may have got a look that may have 
20 looked like he said something. That's why I 
21 speculate that he may have been looking at the 
22 officer, but, you know, the way the officer pulled 
23 back on us, yes, I feel like, all right, I'm lost. 
24 I was the one that just told you, I didn't say 
25 anything else.

9 might be that you didn't hear it? 
10

A I didn't hear him mumble anything. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Here is a question. 
12 If the 
13 police had already passed you guys up as you are 
14 walking towards home, he is going back towards West 
15 Florissant, how could he have heard you because he 
16 had to come back to you and say what did you say? 
17 A Exactly, so I felt that was my random 
18 thinking, no one said anything, but I didn't say 
19 that to the officer because I didn't know what he 
20 was feeling at the time, the way he pulled a reverse 
21 on us, I was let me stand fast and see what he is 
22 going to say. That's why I basically was standing 
23 side to side talking to him. 
24 Okay, this is 
25 So now you say you don't even think the police heard

3 Again, I was looking at his face while I was talking 
4 and telling him. 
5 Again, I'm not judging 
6 you, but somebody just stole something? 
7 A Right. 
8 On the video that we 
9 watched, he grabbed ahold of the man? 
10 A Right. 
11 He said something to him 
12 and he lunged at him, okay, you are walking down the 
13 street? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 The police tell you to 
16 get the fuck on the sidewalk? 
17 A Correct. 
18 And you say I'm almost 
19 home, you are thinking to yourself we are not doing 
20 anything wrong, didn't you? Somebody did just do 
21 something wrong, so that still begs the question why 
22 you did not listen to the police? 
23 A Yeah, like I said before, at the time we 
24 was walking from the store, I saw with my two eyes 
25 police squad cars pass us by, neither one of those

1 cars stopped us or said hey, did you just come out 
2 of that store or anything like that. 
3 So in my mind at the time they were 
4 unaware or the store clerk never made the call 
5 because before we saw Darren Wilson, we saw two more 
6 police cars. He was the third police car we saw and 
7 he was the first one that stopped us. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So you guys thought, or at 
9 least you thought you were in the clear that this 
10 officer wasn't talking to you about the Cigarillos. 
11 A Not so much me in the clear because I know 
12 I didn't commit a crime. I was so much thinking 
13 maybe he didn't call the police, that's all I was 
14 thinking. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: You were worried, you 
16 already said --
17 A I was worried because of, I know that, you 
18 know, he's not a person like that and I'm worried 
19 because I don't think, well, I don't know what is in 
20 his mind. I can't think what he's thinking at the 
21 time, but I know, you know, I've been locked up 
22 before, not for anything like that, jail is not for 
23 nobody. Nobody should ever want to go to jail. So 
24 I knew that's where he was headed, so that is where 
25 my worry and fear is coming from.

Q 
Darren Wilson the police officer? 
(By Ms. Whirley) Yes, the police officer. 
7 A He never stopped stop us and said hey, 
8 freeze, stop right there, let me get out of my car 
9 anything like that. I've been stopped by police 
10 before, I know there is a way that they stop or pull 
11 up on people, suspects for committing crimes. 
12 So exactly what I said, didn't feel 
13 like he was stopping us or telling us anything like 
14 we were committing a crime so much as chastising 
15 from a father to a son, like you are doing some 
16 wrong. Hey, put that down or don't touch that, it 
17 came off like that, that's how he said it. 
18 You did 
19 say that you have money in your tennis shoes? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. 
21 Why don't you pay for the 
22 Cigarillos?

24 them because when we was in the store, I never

1 to the register, I just stood back because I thought 
2 that he was buying the Cigarillos. 
3 When I saw that he wasn't, I didn't 
4 need that many Cigarillos, that's why I just, you 
5 know, set it back. And because of what was going on 
6 at the time, I don't even want to be, you know, I'm 
7 really trying to get out of the store now. I don't

9 hey, I'll pay for them, it is all right. I'm just

20 A I didn't have enough to purchase all the 
21 Cigarillos that he was grabbing. And at the time, 
22 like I said, we never had a conversation about what 
23 he was going to do in the store or anything like 
24 that. We was just going to get some Cigarillos.

MS. ALIZADEH: You can't hear him? 
I'm sorry, I'll speak up. The store clerk 
12 actually does notice me, like I said, it was a male 
13 store clerk and his daughter was there. She's 
14 looking directly at me, I'm looking at her 
15 face-to-face and she sees me actually put the box of 
16 Cigarillos back and I step back. 
17 Because they are kind of in front of 
18 the door so I really can't get through, like walking 
19 straight. So I have to kind of side step them. The 
20 store clerk, as he walked past me, he never tried to 
21 grab me, hey, you with him, he never did anything 
22 like that. So I felt like, you know what, he saw me 
23 put those back, he saw that my intentions were not 
24 to steal from him, so that's why I believe he didn't

2 When the police 
3 officer backed up and almost ran over you, let's 
4 say, and you guys were facing his window, when he 
5 opened his door, what is your sense of what he was 
6 trying to do when he was opening your door, do you 
7 think he was intentionally trying to hit you with 
8 the door or was he potentially trying to get out of 
9 the car very quickly? 
10 A That I can't speculate on. Again, I 
11 cannot speculate what is in someone's mind or what 
12 their agenda is going to be, but the force that he 
13 used and the power behind it, I believe it was 
14 unnecessary. He could of, and the way he backed up, 
15 if he would have backed up straight back, he would 
16 have been able to open his door, step out of his car 
17 perfectly. But because of the angle where he 
18 reversed and how close we were and how fast he did 
19 it, it happened real fast. Everything happened 
20 continuously right back to back. 
21 It was really with a lot of force and 
22 power that wasn't needed. 
23 Do you think, do you think 
24 it is possible that he didn't know how close you 
25 guys dies were to the car?

1 A I don't think that it is possible not to 
2 see someone. You have a couple of mirrors attached 
3 to your car as you are backing up, I'm sure, I pray, 
4 I hope he was using his mirror and not intentionally 
5 trying to strike us. But like I said, I can't 
6 speculate what he was doing, I know that he was very 
7 forceful and powerful. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: But Dorian, you said you 
9 guys had to kind of jump out of the way? 
10 A We definitely had to step back, not so 
11 much as a big leap to where, you know, oh. It was 
12 more of a step back real fast because of the rear 
13 end, you know, it wouldn't have, the whole back of 
14 the car wouldn't have hit us, it would have been 
15 like a corner of the side of the rear because of how 
16 he was turning his vehicle, it would have struck one 
17 of us, if it would have hit him, it would have fell 
18 into me, but if it would have hit me, I would have 
19 fell onto the ground. 
20 It seem likely 
21 to pull up next to you, you had the first encounter, 
22 he continued down west, probably, potentially looks 
23 in the mirror, sees you have not adjusted your path.

1 you aren't doing what he asked for, backs up, not 
2 only does he back up to stay straight, he backs up 
3 and puts his rear end across that center line, 
4 therefore, blocking your path. You can no longer 
5 walk down the center line any more, he is going to 
6 take that away. And possibly when he is asking you 
7 what did you say, I had a feeling he may be 
8 referring back to the first conversation we had and 
9 he is wondering, what did you say? Didn't you tell 
10 me you were going to get out of the street? 
11 Again, I'm assuming different things in 
12 there, but it may not have been a secondary 
13 conversation that he's referring to, what did you 
14 say when I drove away or when I was coming back, he 
15 very well could have been referring to the very 
16 first conversation, he's wondering why you are still 
17 in the street?

19 didn't hear exactly what I was saying to him or 
20 something like that. I never said that it right
