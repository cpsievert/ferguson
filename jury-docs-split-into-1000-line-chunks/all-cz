8 construction workers that happen to have been around 
9 here in front of my apartment. I thought it was 
10 them at first, but after the third and fourth shot, 
11 I realized it was gunshots. I thought they might 
12 have been hammers or something. I realized a hammer 
13 is not going to be that loud, that's when I realized 
14 it was gunshots.

A 
Q 
A 
Uh-huh. 
Okay. And in that position he had his? 
He had his hand up and he was covering 
9 like this side. 
10 Q Okay, okay. You can sit back down. And 
11 so now, to get the timeframe, you hear the three or 
12 four shots, you look out and that's what you see him 
13 going down to one knee. And then do you hear any 
14 more shots? 
15 A Yes, I would say another four or five 
16 shots. 
17 Q Okay. How much of a pause was there 
18 between the first set of shots and the second set of 
19 shots you heard? 
20 A I would say maybe 20 seconds, 25 seconds 
21 at the most. 
22 Q How long, now, when you heard the first 
23 shots, did you, were you sitting on the couch? 
24 A I was sitting on the couch, yes, when I 
25 heard the first shots.

1 Q 
Page 25 
Did you stay on the couch and just look 
2 out the window or did you get up? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
No, I got up and looked out the window. 
So we talking a matter of a second or two 
5 for you to get up and go look out the window? 
6 A Yeah, I would say around 20 to 25 seconds 
7 because at first, I'm sitting there playing the game 
8 when I heard the shots. At first I assumed it was 
9 the construction workers and then I realized it was 
10 gunshots. 
11 At the time when I recognized that it 
12 was gunshots, I had just kind of sort of believed 
13 that someone had just been shooting or shooting up 
14 in the air because I have heard shooting before in 
15 Canfield. So I just sort of assumed that it was 
16 just something going on, but what kind of made me 
17 get up was like everything happened so fast, what 
18 kind of made me get up my mind it is like 12:00 in 
19 the afternoon, why are people shooting this early. 
20 So that made me get up and just look out the window 
21 to see what was going on, that's when I seen him 
22 down. 
23 Q Okay. And so when you, there may have 
24 been 20 to 25 seconds before you actually go out to 
25 go to the window and see him?
