I don't have the slightest idea, I don't 
4 Was it the officer that did the shooting? 
5 I don't know. 
6 You're not sure? 
8 Initially you thought it was? 
9 I thought it was. 
10 Why did you decide it may not have been? 
11 Because the picture of the police, didn't 
12 look like the picture of the man who checked his 
13 pulse. 
14 Q What picture now? 
15 A On the news, that didn't look like Darren 
16 Wilson who took the pulse.

1 page 17 at the top, before the first shot, you talk 
2 about slamming his hand and like I said once, I 
3 guess once he flung his hand, that's when the first 
4 shot rung off and it hit him. What did you mean by 
5 slam his hand? 
6 A I guess when he grabbed him by his shirt, 
7 you know, reaction from a person grabbing your 
8 shirt, you are going to initially grab his hand to 
9 try to snatch it away or smack his hand away.

11 officer's hand away?

Yeah. 
Did you see Mike Brown strike the officer? 
No, ma'am. 
And once Mike Brown is down on the ground, 
16 did the officer shoot any more? 
17 A Somehow, all I know, I didn't know if he 
18 got in the head. We notice there was a blood trail 
19 coming from his head as he was laying on the street. 
20 Q Okay. But my question is, you saw him hit 
21 the ground? 
22

3 A No, ma'am.

6 A Nothing. 
7 Q Okay. Was there any point that you 
8 thought maybe when you first talked to the FBI 
9 agents that the officer shot him while he was on the 
10 ground? 
11 A It could have happened that way like once 
12 he fell. 
13 Q Did you ever think that? 
14 A Yes, I did. 
15 Q Tell us why, tell us a little bit more 
16 like that? 
17 A There was too many shots. After a certain 
18 many shots he fell. And I guess he was going to 
19 make sure, I didn't know if he was absolutely there, 
20 I don't know. It is how it happened.

22 at him once he fell?
