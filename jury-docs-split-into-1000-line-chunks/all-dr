1 previous statement where you said you saw his shirt 
2 and that you saw the bullets going through him 
3 because you saw his shirt pop or something like 
4 that. Did you think that you saw bullets coming out 
5 of his back? 
6 A That's what I thought. 
7 Q Okay. Do you think that today? 
8 A I don't know what I think today. Because 
9 I still, I've never seen somebody get shot before 
10 and when I watch it on TV they make all of these 
11 crazy movements when they get shot. He didn't make 
12 one single movement. It was like the bullets went 
13 right through him and he didn't know they were going 
14 through him. 
15 Q Okay. But did you see bullets come out of 
16 his back? 
17 A I didn't see the bullets. I seen what 
18 looked like might have been. 
19 Q Okay. But now you know that there were no 
20 injuries, bullet holes on his back, don't you?

Yes. 
And it is very important and I understand 
20 that sometimes you think you see something and then 
21 maybe you realize that you didn't actually see it or 
22 what have you, but my point is, at some point you 
23 had described it as if the bullets were coming out 
24 of his back?

15 been exactly the way you saw?

The one officer?

13 Q So when the officer who was firing, when 
14 he started to move backwards, did he walk backward 
15 or did he turn around and go backward? 
16 A He was walking backwards and that's when 
17 the other guy just took his gun out and then they 
18 went out of sight. I didn't see anything else after 
19 that until we put all of our stuff away. 
20 Q So you said he might have taken a couple 
21 of steps while he was firing, moving forward? 
22 A Yeah, it looked like he was about 10 feet 
23 away, but by the time he got finished, it was like 
24 eight to seven, seven to eight feet away from him, 
25 six feet away.
