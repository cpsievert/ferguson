1 You mean if it were gravely, 
2 or if there were rocks in the road? 
3 A Right, yes. 
4 Okay. 
5 A That could affect it. And what I should 
6 say to you, when we do autopsies in our line of 
7 work, we try to answer as many questions and issues 
8 that we can. We often, there are findings that we 
9 can't explain. So that even issues like the cause 
10 here, I can't really explain it. And that, that 
11 often happens in autopsies, you explain the major 
12 ones that answer the question, but not everything. 
13 And there are other experts that is a 
14 gravel expert, they have gravel experts might have a 
15 better idea or somebody doing experiments on 
16 injuries to skin, which are very difficult to do now 
17 because it needs appropriate approval by boards that 
18 you can't do experiments on people that hurt people. 
19 However, they can do it on pigs and animals 
20 sometimes and there may be somebody around who is an 
21 expert on that, but it would be more able to answer 
22 the questions on that surface with the human skin. 
23 It is very similar to pig skin, would develop these 
24 injuries just from contact with the gravel falling 
25 with a certain force.

I'm sorry, there we go. 
They don't train you how to do that in law 
13 school, I guess. 
14 Q I'm just not paying close enough 
15 attention. 
16 A What I would say here the bullet wound, 
17 they do everything nowadays these machines, bullet 
18 wound comes down through here and as I repositioned 
19 the head and all and look at all the additional 
20 photographs. I think the bent head that is right on 
21 top of the clavicle here, the collar bone, this 
22 bullet goes through here and this is a reentry 
23 wound. It looks to me like a reentry wound. 
24 I think the way the medical examiner 
25 put it down as a separate entrance. So in that

1 regard I have one less bullet that struck Mr. Brown 
2 than the medical examiner did, but it doesn't change 
3 anything substantially except for forensic pathology 
4 point of view. I think the bullet exits here, goes 
5 into here, hits the clavicle, hits the lungs and 
6 stops. 
7 A bullet that's going straight, the 
8 one that went through the head went through a lot of 
9 thick skull bone and a normal, which is another 
10 indication that it was kind of a spent bullet by the 
11 time that it goes through here and into the lung, 
12 which is right next to it, it has already lost most 
13 of its power. So that I think is reentrance that I 
14 think would be the difference in the way we organize 
15 the tracks. 
16 Here is the third bullet wound of the 
17 chest that I thought might be a reentry when I did 
18 the autopsy, but I think turns out with all the 
19 additional information I agree with the medical 
20 examiner that's an entry wound. 
21 So you have the head, the face, the 
22 facial one coming out here and this pretty much all 
23 could be within a foot or two if fired rapidly. 
24 Whether that was the last bullet wound or not in the 
25 head.

1 Q Okay. So far from what you've described 
2 in the photos we've seen, this would be, you talked 
3 about three entry wounds, three bullets? 
4 A Well, actually, yes. The head, the face, 
5 I'm not counting this one, this is a reentry. 
6 Q Right. 
7 A When I look at it close, it also has 
8 markings of a reentry. It is not quite as round as 
9 an entry wound would be. And this one would be 
10 three, three of the bullet wounds and these are the 
11 wounds, these are the wounds where bullets were 
12 recovered it turns out. 
13 The bullet was recovered here from 
14 the side of the face, right side through the brain 
15 from the side of the face and was recovered from 
16 within the autopsy of the head. 
17 The second bullet comes through the 
18 face into here and then is recovered in the area of 
19 the lung, and the third bullet here comes in here 
20 and largely goes through causing a fracture of the 
21 eighth rib. 
22 See up here is the third rib and this 
23 by the eighth rib and is found, goes through the 
24 eighth rib and the lung, the lower portion, this 
25 upper lung or lower lung on the right and it is

1 found next to the eighth rib in the back. 
2 And what we found in the second 
3 autopsy is that it was the incision made in the 
4 back, not through any injury as it was an incision 
5 made to recover that bullet. 
6 In order to recover the bullet in the 
7 back, it was underneath the skin, they had made some 
8 incisions at the time of the first autopsy and that 
9 all comes into how we have to examine bodies when 
10 there is a re-autopsy. We inferred that there was a 
11 bullet taken out, but I didn't see the photos until 
12 yesterday. 
13 Q And it certainly didn't look like any 
14 injury, he was shot in his back anywhere; is that

1 understand. We're talking about three bullets, but 
2 four bullet wounds because you consider one to be a 
3 reentry. 
4 A Yes, yes. 
5 When you are describing that 
6 reentry wound from the jaw, you had your head like 
7 this. (indicating) 
8 A Yes. 
9 So based on where it is in 
10 the jaw and it reenters in the body, it is pretty 
11 safe to say that the head, it was like this?

still present it would be 
19 with the skin of the jaw next to the clavicle, the 
20 inside, you can feel your collar bone, but right 
21 next to it so that that trajectory could occur. 
22 The reason I ask that 
23 question is because I think having your head like 
24 this versus just falling forward, it is going to 
25 show what you're doing more, do you understand what

1 I'm saying? 
2 A I see what you're saying. I'm not sure of 
3 the interpretation you have is as good of 
4 interpretation as I have, but it would be that the 
5 chin would be, if the chin were not right next to 
6 it, bullet coming out of the chin would have gone 
7 into a different place. 
8 What I'm saying is though 
9 that if he were simply falling forward, his head 
10 would be more lax? 
11 A Yeah, yes, I think that at the time he was 
12 shot his right side of his chin of the jaw was 
13 against the collar bone near the midline at the time 
14 he was shot. I can't tell from that whether he's 
15 going forward, going backwards, whether he's 
16 standing still, I'm just saying that. 
17 To explain that as a reentry 
18 wound and his head is that way, if that's not a 
19 reentry wound and it is separate bullet wound, his 
20 head could have been either or --
21 A If it is not a reentry wound, then it is a 
22 separate bullet wound and that bullet was recovered, 
23 those are the three that were recovered. 
24 That comes out of his right 
25 jaw, is that straight line from the entry point to

1 the exit point out that jaw through his skull a 
2 straight line or did it move as it traveled around 
3 his eye? 
4 A No, pretty much a straight line. The 
5 facial bones and the orbit bones, they're thin bones 
6 and essentially when the bullet goes through, stays 
7 within 5 or 10 degrees, it doesn't go around further 
8 than that in this kind of a setting. Especially a 
9 larger caliber bullet. We sometimes see funny 
10 things with a .22. 
11 People shot in the eye, 
12 right around the skull, no exit wound sometimes? 
13 A No, this is a straight wound and it winds 
14 up that way in probing it. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: All right. You got another 
16 one? 
17 A So those are the three or four. 
18 Now, we have the more complicated 
19 ones.

1 any damage, a bullet that struck the body and as far 
2 as we know it struck the body and disappeared. It 
3 is not in the body and I didn't see anything in the 
4 clothing that would indicate that it landed there. 
5 The clothing, unfortunately, the 
6 T-shirt he was wearing, short sleeves, so it just 
7 goes up to around here. So in long sleeve shirts we 
8 could see more of an entrance and exit in clothing 
9 that would be helpful. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Did you see any gun powder 
11 on the clothing at all? 
12 A Nothing on the clothing. No gun powder on 
13 the clothing and from what I gather the police 
14 didn't either. 
15 And this is an entry wound from the 
16 front, the upper arm is, you've been told about the 
17 anatomical position, the imaginary anatomic position 
18 that medical examiners' use. In autopsies, body, 
19 palms forward at attention, all measurements are 
20 done that way. 
21 It is very rare that victims are that 
22 cooperative, so you can tell exactly what happened 
23 because the body is mobile and in this situation, if 
24 this is front anterior, the bullet came in near the 
25 top and came out the back, that's a front. In and

2 wound and I think the next one shows the 
3 controversial one. 
4 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Okay. We'll do this one 
5 and then we'll take a break. Number 83, is this the 
6 right way, Doctor? 
7 A Yes, that's good, thank you. 
Q Sure. 8 
9 
10 
A What's interesting here this is. 
Q Should I bring it down a little bit, I 
11 don't know if that will help or not. 
12 A What's interesting to me is that, you 
13 know, the blood, nothing has been washed off. This 
14 is the entrance behind and the exit, and this bullet 
15 went through a bone in the forearm. The ulnar bone, 
16 the two bones in the arm, the radius and ulnar. The 
17 ulnar is kind of underneath the pinky and the radius 
18 is on the other side. 
19 This went through the radius, the 
20 x-rays that show little fragments of metal and the 
21 fracture of the radius bone. Partly, that's why 
22 there's such a big exit wound, it is wobbling and it 
23 had destroyed some bone. 
24 But this is the entrance and this is 
25 the exit and this is from behind. Now it went from

2 Now, it could be standing at 
3 attention, going back and front, could be arms up, 
4 could be arms way up, would have the same thing. It 
5 could be if the arm is in front, since the arm is 
6 mobile, if I put my arm like this, it could come in 
7 the back of the arm and come out the front. And in 
8 that situation it would have to reenter into the 
9 body, which we don't see, which we don't see. 
10 
11 
Q Why do you see that as controversial? 
A Well, as to whether he was shot, people 
12 say from the back, no injuries to the back, but I 
13 interpret that as being from behind. 
14 Q Right. 
15 A I know there's some controversy as to 
16 whether or not he was shot while his back was to the 
17 officer. 
18 Q That's a question that we have. 
19 A Yeah. 
20 Q Does this support that? 
21 A This would support from being shot from 
22 behind. It didn't hit his back, but from behind. 
23 There are other ways if this arm could be moved in 
24 other directions, you can twist your arm around and 
25 that has to be taken into account, but there isn't

1 any kind of mark, bullet wound on the chest that 
2 would support that. And so much of it becomes, 
3 which eyewitnesses are better and that's, that 
4 doesn't come with medical school. 
5 Q I guess within the bowels of reasonable 
6 medical certainty or in your opinion, you're saying 
7 that this injury to this forearm could have occurred 
8 with his hand up? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Or with him running and someone shooting 
11 him from behind, or not running, someone shooting 
12 him from behind? 
13 A I'm saying at the time of the shooting the 
14 gun was pointed at the back of his arm, that's all. 
15 Where his arm was depends on what other information 
16 you have. 
17 Q I see. 
18 A This is from behind from a forensic point 
19 of view. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Any questions? 
21 Pretty much the same 
22 situation in the hand, you can get an idea where the 
23 gun was positioned, the trajectory of the bullet, 
24 but you can't really determine the positioning of 
25 the limb?

You're right, at the moment of fire. 
Okay. 
3 A A limb can go through, within a second, go 
4 like this. All I can say is at the instant of 
5 firing it is almost an instant it could go through, 
6 the bullet, the muzzle was pointing at the back.

If he was positioned this way to the gun. 
Exactly. If the police are 
3 here and I shoot, that don't mean that he shoot from 
4 the back. 
5 A That could be from the side, but then you 
6 see once that bullet comes out, it would strike 
7 something if it is there. If it is this way. 
8 He's running and he's doing 
9 this with his hand, you move the arm when you run 
10 and the police was right there, it could strike here

MS. WHIRLEY: So we're back on the record. 
(By Ms. Whirley) So, Doctor, tell us how 
7 many wounds have we gone through so far? You 
8 thought six to seven. 
9 A I think we're gone through eight wounds 
10 and seven bullets tracks. 
11 Q Okay, all right. And tracking, when you 
12 say bullet tracks, when you say tracking, what did 
13 that mean, first of all? 
14 A Examining injuries to the body caused by 
15 bullets. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A Even though some of these injuries are 
18 less important than others. 
19 Q Are you able to tell like where the 
20 shooter was in relation to the person that shot by 
21 looking at wounds? 
22 A In my opinion of the seven bullets that 
23 struck Mr. Brown, five came from in front of him, 
24 the one in the biceps can't tell, the one that, of 
25 the seven bullets that struck, one was in the hand,

1 which I think based on the, my review of the 
2 histology and all, came while his hand was in the 
3 car. 
4 One came through the upper arm biceps 
5 graze wound, can't tell which direction. And one 
6 came from behind the right forearm, which could have 
7 come from behind, the others were from in front of 
8 him, the weapon was pointed at his front at the time 
9 of discharge. 
10 
11 
Q Okay. Any questions on any of that? 
We'll look at another. This came out 
12 of Grand Jury Exhibit Number 7, photograph is Number 
13 6. And let's see, which way, Doctor, the other way? 
14 A Yes, the head by three o'clock, thank you. 
15 The reason I'm showing this, I did examine his 
16 clothing yesterday at the police building and was 
17 impressed, which I haven't realized it that there 
18 were drops of blood that had come from drippings 
19 from above. And there was some on the socks, which 
20 you can see closer if you look at the socks, drops 
21 of the socks. 
22 There had to be a time, from the time 
23 that Mr. Brown was injured and bleeding until he 
24 collapsed where the blood was coming from above. 
25 And the only place I could figure out it came from

1 was the hand. 
November 13, 2014 
Page 72 
2 So that after he takes his hand from 
3 the car, he is dripping blood that goes, there's 
4 also some on the shirt, but that has a lot of blood 
5 that developed after he was on the ground because 
6 the body kept oozing blood while he's laying face 
7 down after he's dead. And so there's a lot of blood 
8 that occurred after he died, but these drops of 
9 blood all came while he was alive and to me had some 
10 significance about this occurring while he was going 
11 away from the car. 
12 I can't tell from this how far away 
13 from the car he was, but he did not leave that car 
14 without realizing that he had suffered an injury to 
15 the hand. Whatever psychological effect that has on 
16 people, he knew he was bleeding, he knew he had a 
17 gunshot wound to the hand. 
18 And the skin on the car matches 
19 coming from here. So that I think that, whoever 
20 examined the car, they did a very fine job to find a 
21 piece of tissue on the car because it had already 
22 dried and all, when he takes the hand out of the car 
23 after it's injured, it goes against, it leans 
24 against the car, wherever that was taken from, I 
25 don't know which part of the outside it was and then

2 and all. 
3 Q In your review of all the information to 
4 come up with conclusions, did you determine whether 
5 or not Michael Brown was right or left handed? 
6 A No, I didn't determine that from the 
7 autopsy. 
8 Q Did you determine it from any other 
9 source? 
10 A I think I was told he was right handed, 
11 I'm not sure. 85 percent of people are 
12 right-handed, but I don't know, I didn't determine. 
13 Q Okay. And if, as you described the wound 
14 to the hand as occurring in close range, not 
15 contact, but close range while his hand was inside 
16 of the car. And it would have bled quite a bit, 
17 would we, should we expect to see a lot of bleeding 
18 in the car? 
19 A I would expect that there would be blood 
20 in the car, plus blood on the weapon, you know, that 
21 drops of blood came out and blood along the trail, 
22 blood drops coming down don't only land on the 
23 socks, they would land on the ground and it would 
24 depend on how carefully the scene was examined to 
25 look for a blood trail, especially in hot weather.

1 One of the things about hot weather 
2 it does things to blood and all on the ground that 
3 makes it harder to identify. And that kind of a 
4 trail can be helpful in determining how far he went. 
5 
6 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
But you know that from the position of the 
7 body, I don't know the distance, I've heard all kind 
8 of distances. 
9 Q But it would be your opinion that the 
10 majority of the bleeding that would have occurred 
11 before he fell to the ground came from the hand? 
12 A Yes, there was no other place that he 
13 would be bleeding from. Once he goes down on the 
14 ground, he's bleeding from the head and from the 
15 chest and that would accumulate with time. So 
16 that's why we see a lot of it on clothing on the 
17 upper shirt. But that happened after he collapses. 
18 Q So when he's shot, let's kind of go 
19 through it. He's shot, there's a gunshot wound to 
20 the hand, there's a gunshot wound to the forearm? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
That comes later, yes. 
That comes later. Because, I believe, you 
23 said it is your opinion that the gunshot wound to 
24 the head would have been last; is that correct, to 
25 the top of the head?

1 A The three of them happen in rapid 
2 succession and certainly he would lose consciousness 
3 on the top of the head. 
4 Q All three of those are in the head region; 
5 is that correct? 
6 A One in the head, one above the eye and one 
7 around the level of the nipple on the right chest. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. So those are the three? 
Yeah, because they lineup pretty good if 
10 there was somebody shooting rapidly. 
11 Q Okay. My question to you is twofold, one 
12 is, once he received the shots, all the shots that 
13 you examine except for the head shot, and maybe it 
14 cannot be separated, I don't know. Would he still 
15 have been mobile? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q On his feet and able to run or charge at 
18 an object? 
19 A I think that certainly the arm shots, the 
20 arm shots would not prevent him from being mobile 
21 and running front or back or whatever. And the one 
22 in the lower chest wouldn't necessarily slow him 
23 down, but the one in the eye, you know, that goes 
24 through his right eyeball would, could make him lose 
25 consciousness because it does have lines of force

1 going through the brain tissue and all, but not 
2 necessarily. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A So he could have been, now whether he 
5 could be running or, you know, or walking or 
6 whatever, would vary from person to person. In 
7 fact, some people if they're shot once in the arm 
8 might faint, I guess he wasn't the fainting kind. 
9 So how people react to gunshot wounds 
10 is a different thing, but from the anatomy point of 
11 view, he would have been able to be conscious and 
12 theoretically, but for the bullet wound in the head, 
13 could have been treated and survived if he went 
14 right to a hospital or something. 
15 Q And the wounds that are around the right, 
16 you said there was one to the chest area, correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you don't think he would have been 
19 bleeding much from those wounds? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Well --
Before he collapsed? 
He would be bleeding internally, but not 
23 outside because bleeding usually, internal organs 
24 are injured internally and then they will spill 
25 outside. When he collapses, the blood will start

3 No, that was the question 
4 that I had because I was wondering, I said why, I 
5 mean, this is a big guy, I'm quite sure the volume 
6 of blood in his 
7 A Is more than normal. 
8 I know when I went to the 
9 doctor to get a flu shot, she stuck me and I didn't 
10 bleed. She said you have good elasticity in your 
11 skin and I thought maybe that's why he's not 
12 bleeding. 
13 A That's true. We see this a lot with knife 
14 wounds, even in the heart. The knife goes in and 
15 goes out and most people, the skin and fat tissue 
16 will immediately close up, you know, there isn't a 
17 hole left. It is a slow process for bleeding to 
18 occur through the body. 
19 Superficial cuts on the hand bleed 
20 very much, and this is sort of a superficial cut 
21 because there's no skin there to come together from 
22 elasticity, so that's why cut wounds bleed more than 
23 bullet wounds because the bullet goes in and the 
24 skin elasticity and the outer most tissue underneath 
25 it close it up.

1 So when he is shot in the front, the 
2 blood doesn't start to come out right away. It 
3 could in a few minutes, but he collapses to the 
4 ground. And you can see in the head, there wasn't 
5 blood matting the hair, although there was bleeding 
6 that came out. 
7 I can see in the scene photograph 
8 there was some blood coming out gradually from the 
9 top of the head, but it went downward and didn't mat 
10 the hair up. It wasn't a massive amount, it was a 
11 small amount. 
12 So that I think that in the normal 
13 course you get very little blood coming out if a 
14 person collapses right away before death occurred in 
15 this case, because of that final shot.

1 shot, if you are? 
2 A A very topical question. Yeah, marijuana 
3 is not a drug, it is a group of about 18 different 
4 chemicals. So that it isn't like taking a 
5 barbiturate or cyanide, which is just one chemical, 
6 marijuana has all kind of different chemicals where 
7 it is grown, the fertilizer, the water supply. The 
8 one that is most active is the Delta-9, 
9 tetrahydrocannabinol, THC. He had some of that in 
10 his blood. And that could affect, could have 
11 affected him, however, it is a relative small amount 
12 and how it affects somebody varies. 
13 Some people can have hallucinations 
14 with a lot of marijuana, other people just go to 
15 sleep. During the '30s, 1930s, there was terror of 
16 marijuana that it made everybody go crazy, it 
17 doesn't make people go crazy. That's why the laws 
18 have been so strict on it, but now it is coming into 
19 more legal status in some places. 
20 Marijuana is kind of unpredictable, 
21 some people can take marijuana and do funny things 
22 and other people are just perfectly normal with it. 
23 The problem, marijuana from the 
24 toxicology point of view, marijuana gets into the 
25 soft tissues and fatty tissues in the body. So even

1 though I smoked a joint two days ago, I might still 
2 have little bits coming out today into the 
3 bloodstream, or even studies have done for three or 
4 four weeks as it's released from the fat. 
5 So the amount of marijuana he has 
6 could cause abnormal behavior, but usually doesn't. 
7 The best indicator of that would be what his 
8 behavior was in the time period before and I try to 
9 look at that and you see the incident with the 
10 cigars, where he took the cigars or the little 
11 cigars. Would that in any way be affected by 
12 marijuana I think is a guess. Was he walking the 
13 street because of marijuana? That isn't usually 
14 what happens with marijuana, but it could be and it 
15 is too variable. 
16 If all of us smoked the same amount 
17 of marijuana, we would all act differently. Most of 
18 us would just feel very nice about it, somebody 
19 might not feel very bad about it and some people may 
20 go to sleep and somebody might do something that he 
21 wouldn't normally do, but that's, but it was 
22 present, but he did take it within a day or two.

1 He indicated in his 
2 testimony that the amount of Delta 9-THC that he had 
3 in his blood compared to the way it is broken down, 
4 not just in the urine, but in the blood was not 
5 consistent with just a little bit of an amount. He 
6 indicated that given, if you look at the whole 
7 picture and not just the 12 nanograms and when it 
8 was done, that it would indicate that it was a 
9 larger amount than just a little bit amount of 
10 marijuana, would you agree with that? 
11 A Well, it is definitely evidence of smoking 
12 marijuana. The problem is whether it is 12 or five 
13 or 20, it affects people differently and a lot of it 
14 has to do with how, what do you call it, how used to 
15 it, how often a person has taken it before. If you 
16 take it more often, it has less of an unpredictable 
17 affect. 
18 It could have been a factor in his 
19 behavior, but the best measure of his behavior is 
20 what he was doing all day. Was he acting different 
21 than he usually did, for example, and that would be 
22 for friends and relatives or witnesses who saw him 
23 during the day. Was shoplifting cigars a great 
24 departure from his usual behavior. 
25 So great of a departure that one

1 could say he was influenced by the marijuana or did 
2 he do that sometimes when he didn't have marijuana. 
3 It is interesting that no other drugs 
4 were found and no other medications were found. 
5 couldn't find if he had been taking any other 
6 medications that he had stopped taking. 
I 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Why is that interesting to 
8 you? 
9 A Because if he was supposedly taking some 
10 medications for weight or for emotional disturbance 
11 or for sleep or so, and under a medical directive we 
12 should see it in his bloodstream. With the 
13 toxicology and the toxicology can tell us if 
14 somebody is taking drugs you are not supposed to 
15 take, like marijuana, or some they didn't take drugs 
16 that they should have taken. 
17 Suppose somebody is on antipsychotic 
18 medication and there is none in his toxicology, that 
19 would indicate he wasn't taking his medication, that 
20 could be a reason for his behavior. 
21 So toxicology, everything it has and 
22 everything it doesn't have has significance, and in 
23 this instance, I think marijuana is significant that 
24 he smoked marijuana, but 99 out of 100 people taking 
25 marijuana aren't going to get in a fight with a
