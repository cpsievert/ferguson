the officer. (indicating)

went down? 
A Yes.

17 
18 
19 Q Okay. Did it appear to you that Michael 
20 Brown was charging the officer? 
21 A I didn't get the impression of a charge 
22 because it wasn't fast enough to be a charge. 
23 Q Okay. Did it appear to you that the 
24 officer had to shoot Michael Brown in order to 
25 protect himself?

1 A I wouldn't say had to. At the time I was 
2 relieved because I believed at the time, I still 
3 stand by my original statement, but my impression at

Right. 
Okay. So my question is, when the officer

MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask a couple just to 
15 clarify, and I didn't ask you about this earlier, 
16 Did you see another black younger 
17 male that was smaller than Mr. Brown at, near, 
18 around the vehicle or running in that area? 
19 A I have no idea who you might be speaking 
20 of. The neighborhood was filled with young black 
21 people. They were all over the place. It is a 
22 neighborhood full of them. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: So you don't recall seeing 
24 anybody near, or besides Mike Brown, and you've 
25 already described where you saw him, did you ever

1 see another black gentleman at or near the police 
2 vehicle? 
3 A No, my attention was on the officer and 
4 Mr. Brown. I did not. 
5 Q Okay. And, you know, from what you've 
6 stated, you didn't see anything that occurred prior 
7 to you coming around that bend, correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So if there was anything that happened 
10 prior to you coming around the bend, whether it was 
11 between the officer and Mike Brown or anyone else 
12 that was there, you didn't witness that? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And let me ask you because Sheila Whirley 
15 had asked you about whether or not you felt the 
16 officer had to fire, if there was something that 
17 occurred prior to the officer running after Michael 
18 Brown, you have no idea what that was? 
19 
20 
A No, I do not. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Just one last follow-up. As 
21 Michael Brown is running away from the officer and 
22 he fired at him. 
23 
24 
A Uh-huh. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Did it appear that Michael 
25 Brown was a threat at that time in your opinion?

1 A I believe that, I believe, I certainly 
2 believe at the time that Mr. Brown was dangerous. 
3 It was my belief at the time that here was somebody 
4 with a gun running from the police in a residential 
5 neighborhood. That's always a danger, a very real 
6 concern. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, thank you. Anybody 
8 else, questions? 
9 What 
10 were you doing when you entered the complex? You 
11 said your wife was driving and you were in the 
12 passenger seat, what were you doing at that time, 
13 were you looking around, were you talking?

10 
A Somewhere in this area. (indicating) 
Okay. And you said 
11 throughout everything that Michael Brown spun 
12 around, do you feel that he spun around on his own 
13 accord or do you feel it was due to the impact of 
14 being shot. 
15 A The bullet, the impact of being shot, uh, 
16 certainly appeared to have started him turning. And 
17 whether he continued of his own volition or not, I'm 
18 not certain. It looked like the impact started to 
19 spin him around and when he completed the turn, he 
20 was facing us again and came back toward the 
21 officer. 
22 Okay. So you feel that 
23 maybe if he hadn't been shot, he might have

18 to do with the threat towards the police officer 
19 because he was a big guy? 
20 A It's possible, it's possible. I don't 
21 believe the officer was as tall. My impression was 
22 that the officer was perhaps 3 or 4 inches shorter 
23 than Mr. Brown. I'm not certain how tall either one 
24 of them are, but I got the impression that he was 
25 about half a head shorter.

And so was this then as a part of an area 
Yes, it was.

7 basically you're going door to door and knocking on 
8 doors and stopping people when they pull into the 
9 parking lot, get out of their cars, asking them if 
10 they saw anything or know anything; is that right? 
11 
12

That's correct. 
And so when you went to see 
13 this wasn't as a specific purpose to interview

1 A He initially heard the shots, he was 
2 sitting on the couch when he got up, he heard the 
3 shots, he went up and looked out his window and he 
4 had a partial view of Canfield Drive from his 
5 apartment window. 
6 Q All right. And what did he tell you who, 
7 if anybody, did he say he saw when he looked out the 
8 window? 
9 A He saw who he now knows to be Michael 
10 Brown in the street walking away from the apartment 
11 building, kind of walking going down the street. 
12 Q Okay. There is a laser pointer in front 
13 of you, you were gesturing with your hands toward

1 A His apartment window would have been right 
2 here. He would have seen Mr. Brown walking this 
3 direction. (indicating) 
4 Q So he would have been facing west on 
5 Canfield Drive walking in a westerly direction if 
6 this is west? 
7 A That's correct. 
8 Q Okay. And did he see any police officers 
9 from that vantage point? 
10 
11 
12 do? 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Initially, no. 
And what did he say he saw Michael Brown 
He heard the first couple of shots, three 
14 shots, went to his window, looked out and saw 
15 Mr. Brown walking westward down Canfield Drive. He 
16 heard approximately six more shots, saw Mr. Brown 
17 grab his torso with one hand and had another hand 
18 up, drop to his knee and fall to the ground. 
19 Q And so when you interviewed 
20 let me ask you this. Had he just like gotten up out 
21 of bed or was he intoxicated or under the influence 
22 of something that you thought might make it, might 
23 affect his ability to recall what he told you? 
24 A No, he answered the door, he was alert and 
25 willing to answer any questions.

1 Q Okay. And so he told you that he saw 
2 Michael Brown walking away from him. In other 
3 words, away from where he was in his apartment. And 
4 then in the direction where he would have been 
5 walking west on Canfield Drive? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q Okay. Did you ever go back and actually 
8 clarify that with him as far as whether or not he 
9 saw Michael Brown moving in the direction, moving in 
10 that direction or whether or not Michael Brown was 
11 standing still? 
12 A We clarified that with him at least three 
13 times during the interview just to make sure that we 
14 understood what he was saying, and the other agent 
15 made sure what he was saying. 
16 He was very clear that he saw 
17 Mr. Brown, he now knows it's Mr. Brown, at the time 
18 he did not know who it was, walking, walking west on 
19 Canfield. 
20 Q And this was after he had heard a series 
21 of gunshots, correct?

23 Q And then he observed him, he heard another

2 weapon. 
3 Q And then did he say he saw Michael Brown, 
4 you said, clutching his torso or holding his torso 
5 and then one hand up. I can't recall which hand, 
6 you demonstrated. I think you demonstrated your 
7 right hand up?

That's how he demonstrated it. 
Okay. And then he went down to one knee 
10 and collapsed in the street? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Did he tell you then he saw a police 
13 officer after that? 
14 A After Michael Brown had fallen to the 
15 ground, he saw an officer approach Michael Brown 
16 from the west and approach Michael Brown. 
17 Q And so the officer was coming from the 
18 west, was he walking east on Canfield then?

1 living room during the encounter, during the shots. 
2 So we asked her specifically, she was in the 
3 kitchen, we asked her specifically if she saw 
4 anything. She said no. We asked her why, she said 
5 well, by the time she had gotten into the living 
6 room by the window, it was over. 
7 She was in the bedroom at the time, 
8 he had summoned her into the living room and at that 
9 point it was over, she didn't see what happened. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: You gave her an opportunity 
11 to tell you whether or not she saw something and 
12 she, in fact, told you she did not? 
13 
14 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That's all I have. Anybody 
15 else have questions? 
16 I just 
17 want to verify the date. This was, this took place 
18 on 8/16? 
19 A It was a Saturday, our interview was the 
20 Saturday after the incident took place. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: The same Saturday that the 
22 incident took place? 
23 
24 
A A week later. 
MS. ALIZADEH: My math is terrible, but 9 
25 plus 7 was 16. I had to do it in the sky.

1 Any other questions for the agent? 
2 Did you look out 
3 the window that they looked out of, did you see the 
4 area where Michael Brown was, was he able to see 
5 what he reported seeing? 
6 A Yes. That street was not completely 
7 visible from his apartment. You could only see 
8 parts of it. So as far as what he was telling us, 
9 what he could see, I would believe would be 
10 accurate. 
11 Okay, thank you. 
12 
13 
A You couldn't see the whole thing. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anyone else? 
14 You said 
15 he could only see part of the road there in 
16 Canfield. What exactly was blocking his view? 
17 A I can't recall if it was the building or a 
18 tree there, but all I can recall is the view of 
19 Canfield was very limited from his apartment window. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else? All right. 
21 This will be the end of the testimony of Special 
22 Agent

1 present, myself, Sheila Whirley and the court 
2 reporter , and we just had a small break after 
3 a witness testimony. And I want to make sure we put 
4 on the record that there was some questions that 
5 were asked after the witness testified about some 
6 dates and when certain witnesses were interviewed. 
7 And I think what we discussed and kind of clarified 
8 is that according to what you've heard so far, 
9 who is the fiancee of , was 
10 interviewed by the County Police on August 9th, the 
11 day that Michael Brown was killed. 
12 And that then Agent and his partner 
13 went to their apartment and as a part of an area 
14 canvas with no specific purpose of looking for 
15 anyone in particular other than any witness that saw 
16 this. 
17 And that he then interviewed 
18 on the 16th of August. He also said that 
19 was present in the apartment at the time and 
20 said she didn't see anything. 
21 And then you all have also heard from a 
22 statement that was interviewed by the 
23 FBI, like on September 30th or something, and that 
24 during that interview she described what she says on 
25 the 30th she saw.

1 So there was some question about whether 
2 or not the FBI knew that the FBI, meaning Agent 
3 and Agent , whether they knew that 
had been talked to by agent 
partner, and/or whether or not agent 
and his 
was 
4 
5 
6 aware that had been interviewed by the 
7 County Police prior to their interview of her. 
8 And what I explained to you is, to the 
9 best of my knowledge and guess would be that they 
10 did not know of the other interviews that had taken 
11 place, however, I will tell you that's only until 
12 the best guess on my part based upon my 
13 understanding of how the investigation was going at 
14 that time. 
15 The FBI was working independently of the 
16 County Police at that time. And the County Police 
17 were not involved in that canvas that took place on 
18 the 16th. 
19 Originally, there was talk that was, they 
20 were going to do the canvas together, the County 
21 Police and the FBI. And then the FBI said, no, we 
22 are going to do the canvas just on our own. So the 
23 County Police are not a part of that canvas. 
24 And so I can clarify this with Detective 
25 and, of course, Detective will

1 probably testify again before your investigation is 
2 completed, but you certainly can ask him that. 
3 It is my belief and thought is that 
4 probably agent was not aware that 
5 had been interviewed by County Police when 
6 he went to go see, he knocked on their door on the 
7 16th. And then also I would have to verify with 
8 
9 
10 
11 
Agent and , it is my guess that they 
were not aware that Agent had seen 
Agent 
and had spoken to her on the 16th because 
did not put that in his report because 
12 he, according to him, and I discussed this with him, 
13 since said she didn't see anything, he didn't 
14 include that. It is like he just didn't. 
15 Whether he should or not is not for me to 
16 say, but he just didn't. So I don't think that 
17 
18 
19 
Agent and Agent 
had talked to 
on the 30th. 
were aware that he 
when they interviewed 
20 I will certainly try to clear that up for 
21 you, but that's only my thought and opinion at this 
22 point. All right.
