14 A Every crime scene van is equipped with a 
15 metal detector. They're primarily used for finding 
16 shell casings and heavily grass areas or other 
17 pieces of metal evidence. We have used them before 
18 to look for projectiles, we understand that when a 
19 bullet is fired, a projectile doesn't stop 
20 necessarily for a lot of things, including the 
21 earth.

23 bullet may have skipped into grass and you would

1 ground, it is going to be so deep, it would take a 
2 lot of manpower and/or just work to get it out and 
3 not guarantee that you will actually be able to 
4 recover it. 
5 Q I guess for the sake of understanding 
6 this, when shell casings are ejected, you know they 
7 travel in a predictable direction and somewhat in a 
8 perimeter that doesn't go beyond a certain area, 
9 like you are not going to look in the next block for 
10 a shell casing? 
11 
12

Q 
No, not for a shell casing. 
Right. They tend to be somewhere closer 
13 to the crime scene or to the point where they were

18 account for. 
19 This was a defect that was brought to 
20 our attention by a witness that from what I can 
21 testify to wasn't there when the shooting occurred, 
22 but lived in this building and brought this to our 
23 attention. I think there is a bullet hole in our 
24 siding.

1 photo was taken. I took out about a 6 foot section 
2 of her siding and the insulation that's on it. 
3 Behind it is three quarter inch of plywood and then 
4 in between the plywood there's about a 4 inch gap 
5 and goes into solid concrete cinder block wall. 
6 I could see inside of it that 
7 whatever that was that caused that hole was not 
8 sitting behind there and this was above the window 
9 and it was open behind there. 
10 To continue to look for apparent 
11 projectile that might be in there I would have to 
12 remove that siding all the way around to that 
13 window, the plywood all the way around and cause 
14 significant damage to that apartment building. 
15 Again, without guaranteeing any hope 
16 of actually finding something because I've done this 
17 more than once into just a drywall piece where you 
18 see this and you take it all out and realize that it 
19 just caused that hole and skipped off somewhere. 
20 I've also seen where things have gone through 
21 something like that three or four layers of wood, 
22 hit something concrete, you get it, it just looks 
23 like a penny and it just smashed. 
24 And the firearms ballistic expert

1 the point you can't confer anything from this then. 
2 So we made the decision at that point, after I had 
3 removed the siding to not do any more damage to this 
4 lady's outside of her apartment.

Anything. You can tell it is not exactly

11 with a firearm. Not to say that a firearm couldn't 
12 do that, but it could have been anything. There was 
13 no guarantee or eye witness that said I was standing 
14 here when this happened and this is brand new 
15 damage. 
16 This, in fact, we walked around that 
17 immediate apartment complex and found a few other 
18 damages and defects to siding that had cobwebs on 
19 this and could tell they had been weathered or old

Final photos is Image 161. I explained at 
2 the beginning this would be the first and last 
3 photos that we take in our memory cards for our 
4 photo technicians when they look at our files to 
5 know what the beginning and ending of the scene is. 
6 Q All right. I have two other areas to 
7 cover very quickly. Going back to Grand Jury 
8 Exhibit 2, this is your diagram. So you've already 
9 testified that one of the last things, let me ask 
10 you this, after you've done the photographs and 
11 seized all the evidence that you described, what's 
12 the next thing you do? 
13 A Now we start diagramming. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A Photograph our evidence, selected our 
16 evidence, accounted for every piece of evidence that 
17 we know of at the time. The body has been moved, 
18 cars have been towed, we go back now to diagram the 
19 scene. 
20 Q All right. Now, on Grand Jury Exhibit 
21 Number 2, is this the diagram you made of this 
22 scene? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so we referenced this before, you have

A Correct. 1

3 
Q What does that mean, not to scale? 
A The items in this photo that are not to 
4 scale would be obviously number one, the size and 
5 shape of these apartment buildings, we have them 
6 just as plain rectangles. The size and shape of the 
7 width of the road as compared to the size of the 
8 vehicle. 
9 If you look as far as scale drawings 
10 go, this vehicle is the same size as Michael Brown 
11 here. Those things are hard to do with the software 
12 we're given and the tools that we use as crime scene 
13 detectives to draw into scale on a CAD type drawing. 
14 Also the size of this entry point on 
15 Caddiefield, the driveway is not the same size as 
16 this one. They may be in real life, but whether we 
17 measure to scale or measure for our plotting 
18 purposes of evidence, we don't measure those types 
19 of measurement. 
20 You can see down here in the lower 
21 baseline starting at 0.0 feet. 
22 How we do the diagrams is I took a 
23 long screwdriver and at the corner where Copper 
24 Creek Court comes into Canfield, I drove a 
25 screwdriver down into the dirt and hooked my 250

1 foot measuring tape and 0.0 there. Then from the 
2 edge of the road from Canfield, run from 0.0, we run 
3 that tape measure out as far past our last piece of 
4 evidence that we need to. If you look on page two 
5 of the diagram, it has the measurements and lists of 
6 evidence that was collected. 
7 How this is measured and the reason 
8 why we do this diagram is one, to kind of show a 
9 visual picture of the scene, but two, if we ever 
10 needed to go back and put evidence back in place, we 
11 can easily go back and do that with very little 
12 effort. 
13 As basic as it is, if you look, I'll 
14 use evidence item number 19 I believe is the 
15 farthest one away, you will start at 0.0 and the 
16 your first measurement you will see is listed as. 
17 Q You all have your diagrams and probably 
18 easier to look at the overhead. 
19 A So I will use evidence item number 18 as 
20 my example, or 19, it is even number. If you look 
21 on the diagram, evidence item number 19 is the 
22 bubble here that is farthest to the east. 
23 The first column of measurements 
24 shows baseline west from Copper Creek, so if you 
25 look at the baseline measurement here and walked

1 west 31 feet and stopped, in the second column of 
2 measurements shows 11 feet 9 inches south of the 
3 baseline. So if you measured 31 feet west, 11 feet 
4 9 inches south, that spot right there is where 
5 evidence item 19 is at. 
6 You do that for every piece of 
7 evidence, even down here the ones, the shell casings 
8 we found in the grassy area, evidence item 22, you 
9 are 47 feet 4 inches west of the baseline and then 
10 31 feet 3 inches south and you'd find the exact spot 
11 where that evidence item was placed. 
12 The measurements, we did those 
13 intersecting measurements for items number 1 through 
14 22. 
15 Q Let me stop you. Do those include items 
16 like eight and nine, which I think were on the 
17 vehicle? 
18 A Yes. If you will notice eight and nine do 
19 not have measurements on them because those were 
20 found on the police vehicle on the driver's side 
21 door. So in the second section of marked, it is 
22 labeled Ferguson Marked Police Vehicle Number 108, 
23 you will find the measurements for the location of 
24 each of the four tires from the west baseline and 
25 south of baseline measurements. And from there we

1 could --
Q You could put the car back? 2 
3 A We could put the car back where it was at 
4 and show you by photographs where those red stains 
5 were located. The same for Michael Brown's 
6 location, the same exact technique for west from 0.0 
7 baseline, and south left foot and right foot, left 
8 hand, right hand and head, and then on the bottom it 
9 has a sentence that states again, the baseline runs 
10 east to west on north side of Canfield Road, which 
11 0 feet 0 inches stops and Copper Creek Court. 
12 That's how we do diagramming situations. 
13 So to label this not to scale is 
14 because these things, if you blew it up to life 
15 size, this might not be 153 feet or 152 feet 
16 9 inches. To show you the reason why we put that on 
17 there is to give you the scale of this size of 
18 thing. 
19 Q So just to clarify though, that distance 
20 that is between that you already testified about and 
21 it is blurry here, but the distance from this point 
22 to this point? 
23 A That measurement is from the driver's side 
24 front tire of Darren Wilson's police car to the head 
25 of Michael Brown.

15 MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you. You all have 
16 anything? 
17 I have a 
18 question about projectile. I know earlier you 
19 mentioned inside of the patrol car there was no 
20 casings? 
21 
22 
A 
23 there. 
24 A 
Correct. 
Was there a projectile in 
There was one recovered later, not by me,

1 him that he processed the vehicle at our crime lab. 
2 The one that was found, I 
3 think it was number 17, labeled 17. 
4 A Yes, sir. 
5 Is that one that entered 
6 the body and came out? 
7 A I can't testify to that. One of the 
8 ballistics firearms people that you might hear from, 
9 they can answer those questions, I cannot. 
10 
11 
Yes, ma'am. 
In the 
12 video I'm seeing, and your photographs, I'm seeing 
13 that there was shattered glass within the vehicle? 
14 A Yes. 
15 I'm only seeing two pieces 
16 sitting in the driver's seat of Officer Darren 
17 Wilson's vehicle. 
18 A Yes, ma'am. 
19 Was there any on the floor 
20 that you recall, I didn't really see any in the 
21 pictures as well? 
22 A I haven't looked at the other detectives' 
23 photos extensively. I know when I went to the crime 
24 lab to finish packaging my evidence, the vehicle was 
25 down there and there was a significant amount of

2 that cover. 
3 Inside the door panel 
4 itself? 
5 A Yes. 
6 Can you tell me what kind 
7 of vehicle is this, do you recall? 
A It was a Chevy Tahoe. 
Chevy Tahoe. 
8 
9 
10 A Chevy SUV. I'm not sure if it was a 
11 Suburban or a Tahoe. 
12 All right, thanks. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Just real quickly. There 
14 was another part of your investigation you did 
15 another video from a perspective and that was 
16 because you were told somebody saw something from a 
17 particular window; is that correct? 
18 A Yes, ma'am, I did one and I know another 
19 detective that was at the scene did other ones. The 
20 one I did as far as where, I can't remember the 
21 address, it is on the evidence receipt, they had us 
22 go to different eyewitness perspectives just to 
23 stand there and video similar to this. There is not 
24 narration in it, it simply is a video, me standing, 
25 or whoever the camera operator was at the time,

1 standing where the witness states they were standing 
2 and observed whatever it was they observed. 
3 Again, there is not a narrative 
4 stating they saw this, they were seeing this and my 
5 particular video I know that I stood at the section 
6 where the witness stated she saw what was going on. 
7 I attempted to use our video camera to zoom in 
8 across the parking lot where she was saying she 
9 could see everything happening. 
10 My camera would only focus on the 
11 screen part of the door. It was through a sliding 
12 patio door, it would only focus on the screen no 
13 matter how much I would zoom in, it wouldn't show 
14 the scene from her perspective. I zoomed back, you 
15 had to step to the left and then zoomed in again to 
16 show the distance where she was seeing things and 
17 kind of give you a reference point because at the 
18 time when I did my witness perspective video, it was 
19 after we had picked everything up. 
20 It was the last thing, a witness had 
21 come forward at the very end and said hey, I think I 
22 saw this from here. The detective interviewed and 
23 asked to go down and shoot a witness perspective 
24 from her standpoint. 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: You will see that video

1 later, but I would rather show that to you in 
2 conjunction with that witness testimony so it will 
3 be easier for you to kind of tie those together, but 
4 from his perspective, you know his job, your job was 
5 then just to stand, whatever witness says where they 
6 were and film where she says what she saw she saw? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the purpose of that 
9 is just to see could she see that, are there things 
10 in the way, was it such as that, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, you said that from filming it, the 
13 camera would not focus beyond the screen? 
14 A The human eye could see through the screen 
15 and focus on a point farther than that. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
The camera I was using at the time has 
18 focal limitations and would focus just on the 
19 screen. 
20 Q Let me ask you this, from your eyewitness 
21 perspective, could you see, not what she saw, could 
22 you see the place where she said she saw something? 
23 A From that specific perspective, she could 
24 only see where Michael Brown came to rest. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And so from whatever perspective

1 she was, she could not see farther west to where the 
2 officer's vehicle was? 
3 A No. 
4 Q Okay. But you are standing in her 
5 position, you could see where Michael Brown's body 
6 had been? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q How much farther west could you see beyond 
9 Michael Brown's body? 
10 A You could see from the angle she was at, 
11 which was to give you an orientation because I can 
12 see it in my head. She was on the northeast part of 
13 the apartment complex. 
Q Let's use your diagram. 14 
15 A Here it is. Her apartment building, if 
16 this is the entrance to Copper Creek Court, her 
17 apartment building is farther back this way, which 
18 would be the upper right-hand corner of the diagram. 
19 Again, this is not to scale, this 
20 building in particular comes from close to this 
21 driveway. Her perspective, and if I can come up 
22 here and use my finger to show, her perspective 
23 would have been on this line and the corner of the 
24 building would block the red stain where Michael 
25 Brown's body had been. You could just barely see

1 the stain in the road, the red stain in the road 
2 where his body had been. 
3 Q The large stain that was at his head? 
4 A Yes, that was still present. It was at an 
5 angle just like this, where this building would have 
6 come out at that angle and cut that part of the 
7 scene off where she couldn't see anything else. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
10 address. 
11 Q 
Okay. Do you remember her name? 
I just wrote down her 
When that witness testifies, we will play 
12 that video for what it's worth given the focal 
13 limitations of the camera? 
14 Could she see to 
15 the east the full rest of the crime scene? 
16 
17 
A Yes, it was a third floor apartment. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody else? And as 
18 always, if there are questions later on of this 
19 officer and you would like to have him brought back, 
20 he will come back. 
21 All right. That concludes the testimony 
22 of Detective And that will conclude 
23 the evidence for today, September 3rd, of the grand 
24 jury investigation into the shooting of Michael 
25 Brown.
