19 -- just walking, took a couple 
20 steps back towards him, he probably had one hand up,

1 wakes up and she tells me a friend is knocking at my 
2 door. 
3 I wakes up, which is now 11:00. He comes 
4 and, urn, I goes outside for a few minutes with him 
5 outside or whatever. And he, we went outside for 
6 not long, two, three, four or five minutes. So I 
7 happen to go back in, he leaves. 
8 It is getting what, about 11:45 now, urn, I 
9 was about to take a nap, and I hear an altercation 
10 outside. 
11 So I looks outside and, urn, I see like 
12 some kind of tussling going on in the window. 
13 Really not sure if, urn, if Mike Brown was punching 
14 on him or if the officer was grabbing on him, but 
15 something was going on through the window, it just 
16 didn't look right. So I glued my eyes to it. 
17 And all of the sudden, urn, I see, I also 
18 see his friend, his friend. Urn, he was, he was on 
19 the side of the car, he was on the front bumper on 
20 the passenger side, maybe 4, 5 feet away from him. 
21 And all of the sudden, like I said, they just takes 
22 off running. 
23 And when they takes off running, I see his 
24 friend, he runs behind a two door white car. He's 
25 ducking down behind the trunk of the car looking at

1 the officer because he just immediately gets out of 
2 his vehicle and just started shooting at Mike Brown. 
3 Because he runs down, straight down the middle of 
4 the road. 
5 And, urn, when his friend ran behind the 
6 trunk of the car, he was looking at the officer 
7 thinking that the officer might cut off and walk to 
8 him and shoot him, but obviously, he is just taking 
9 like, you know, large steps in a shooting position, 
10 shooting directly at Mike Brown, and he walked past 
11 his friend. 
12 So at that moment right there, that just 
13 gave me enough time to run outside because like I 
14 said, I thought that he was going for his friend 
15 too, so I didn't want to miss that. So that was my 
16 time when he walked past that was my time to run 
17 outside. 
18 By the time I gets to the door, I notice I 
19 forgot my phone in the bedroom. So I go back, grab 
20 my phone and then I goes back to the front door, 
21 which it didn't take long, just seconds. 
22 So, urn, but about the time I gets outside, 
23 I see Mike Brown, he's now facing the officer, kind 
24 of, he bent down like he was hit in the stomach. He 
25 had both arms wrapped around his stomach and he's
