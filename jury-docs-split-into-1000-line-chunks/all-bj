Q 
I think this would be the most helpful. 
Okay. And we are going to put it on the 
8 projector as soon as we can and have you, you know, 
9 tell us what's going on. 
10 I have a few other questions while we 
11 are waiting on that. So during the time that he's, 
12 you said Michael Brown is striking you in the face 
13 through the car door? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And it was your opinion that you needed to 
16 pull out your weapon because why did you feel that 
17 way, I don't want to put words in your mouth? 
18 A I felt that another one of those punches 
19 in my face could knock me out or worse. I mean it 
20 was, he's obviously bigger than I was and stronger 
21 and the, I've already taken two to the face and I 
22 didn't think I would, the third one could be fatal 
23 if he hit me right. 
24 Q You thought he could hit you and it would 
25 be a fatal injury?

18 that's pointed at me, I'm holding that like this. 
19 So it is pointed at, I would be Brown, he grabbed 
20 with his hand over the top like this manner and then 
21 twisted it down like this. And when it twisted, it 
22 ended up being like this in my hip. That's all I

1 A He grabs my gun, says, "you are too much 
2 of a pussy to shoot me." The gun goes down into my 
3 hip and at that point I thought I was getting shot. 
4 I can feel his fingers try to get inside the trigger 
5 guard with my finger and I distinctly remember 
6 envisioning a bullet going into my leg. I thought 
7 that was the next step. 
8 Q I'm going to stand back so you can talk a 
9 little louder. 
10 A As I'm looking at it, I'm not paying 
11 attention to him, all I can focus on is just this 
12 gun in my leg. 
13 I was able to kind of shift slightly 
14 like this and then push it down, because he is 
15 pushing down like to keep it pinned on my leg. So 
16 when I slid, I let him use his momentum to push it 
17 down and it was kind of pointed to where the seat 
18 buckle would attach on the floorboard on the side of 
19 my car. 
20 Next thing I remember putting my left 
21 hand on it like this, putting my elbow into the back 
22 of my seat and just pushing with all I could 
23 forward.

You don't know if he was saying either? 
I heard stuff, but I couldn't tell you 
3 what it was. 
Q Okay. 4 
5 A Like I said, I was just so focused on 
6 getting the gun out of me. When I did get it up to 
7 this point, he is still holding onto it and I pulled 
8 the trigger and nothing happens, it just clicked. I 
9 pull it again, it just clicked again. 
10 At this point I'm like why isn't this 
11 working, this guy is going to kill me if he gets 
12 ahold of this gun. I pulled it a third time, it 
13 goes off. When it went off, it shot through my door 
14 panel and my window was down and glass flew out of 
15 my door panel. I think that kind of startled him 
16 and me at the same time. 
17 When I see the glass come up, it 
18 comes, a chunk about that big comes across my right 
19 hand and then I notice I have blood on the back of 
20 my hand. 
21 After seeing the blood on my hand, I 
22 looked at him and he was, this is my car door, he 
23 was here and he kind of stepped back and went like 
24 this. 
25 And then after he did that, he looked

1 up at me and had the most intense aggressive face. 
2 The only way I can describe it, it looks like a 
3 demon, that's how angry he looked. He comes back 
4 towards me again with his hands up. 
5 At that point I just went like this, 
6 I tried to pull the trigger again, click, nothing 
7 happened. 
8 Q When you say he came back up to you with 
9 his hands up, describe to us what he is doing? 
10 
11 
12 
A Last thing I saw was this coming at me. 
Q Was it a fist? 
A I just saw his hands up, I don't know if 
13 they were closed yet, on the way to going closed, I 
14 saw this and that face coming at me again, and I 
15 just went like this and I shielded my face. 
16 And you did what? Q 
A 17 Went like this and shielded my face. 
18 Did he hit you at that time? Q 
19 Yes. A 
20 Q Okay. Go ahead. 
A 21 So I pulled the trigger, it just clicks 
that time. 22 Without even looking, I just grab the 
23 top of my gun, the slide and I racked it, and I put 
24 my, still not looking just holding my hand up, I 
25 pulled the trigger again, it goes off. When I look

Page 226 
2 Q So how many times does it go off in the 
3 car? 
4 A It went off twice in the car. Pull, 
5 click, click, went off, click, went off. So twice 
6 in the car. 
7 Q Are you certain? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. 
8 
9 
10 A When I look up after that, I see him start 
11 to run and I see a cloud of dust behind him. I then 
12 get out of my car. As I'm getting out of the car I 
13 tell dispatch, "shots fired, send me more cars." 
14 We start running, kind of the same 
15 direction that Johnson had pointed. Across the 
16 street like a diagonal towards this, kind of like 
17 where the parking lot came in for Copper Creek Court 
18 and Canfield, right at that intersection. And there 
19 is a light pole right there, I remember him running 
20 towards the light pole. 
21 We pass two cars that were behind my 
22 police car while we were running. I think the 
23 second one was Pontiac Grand Am, a green one. I 
24 don't know if it was a two door or four door, I just 
25 remember seeing a Pontiac green Grand Am.

1 When I passed the second one, about 
2 that same time he stopped running and he is at that 
3 light pole. So when he stopped, I stopped. And 
4 then he starts to turn around, I tell him to get on 
5 the ground, get on the ground. 
6 He turns, and when he looked at me, 
7 he made like a grunting, like aggravated sound and 
8 he starts, he turns and he's coming back towards me. 
9 His first step is coming towards me, he kind of does 
10 like a stutter step to start running. When he does 
11 that, his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his 
12 side, his right one goes under his shirt in his 
13 waistband and he starts running at me.

1 I shoot a series of shots. I don't know how many I 
2 shot, I just know I shot it. 
3 I know I missed a couple, I don't 
4 know how many, but I know I hit him at least once 
5 because I saw his body kind of jerk or flenched. 
6 I remember having tunnel vision on 
7 his right hand, that's all, I'm just focusing on 
8 that hand when I was shooting. 
9 Well, after the last shot my tunnel 
10 vision kind of opened up. I remember seeing the 
11 smoke from the gun and I kind of looked at him and 
12 he's still coming at me, he hadn't slowed down. 
13 At this point I start backpedaling 
14 and again, I tell him get on the ground, get on the 
15 ground, he doesn't. I shoot another round of shots. 
16 Again, I don't recall how many it was or if I hit 
17 him every time. I know at least once because he 
18 flinched again. 
19 At this point it looked like he was 
20 almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it 
21 was making him mad that I'm shooting at him. 
22 And the face that he had was looking 
23 straight through me, like I wasn't even there, I 
24 wasn't even anything in his way. 
25 Well, he keeps coming at me after

1 that again, during the pause I tell him to get on 
2 the ground, get on the ground, he still keeps coming 
3 at me, gets about 8 to 10 feet away. At this point 
4 I'm backing up pretty rapidly, I'm backpedaling 
5 pretty good because I know if he reaches me, he'll 
6 kill me. 
7 And he had started to lean forward as 
8 he got that close, like he was going to just tackle 
9 me, just go right through me. 
10 Q Can you demonstrate for us how he was 
11 leaning forward? 
12 A His hand was in a fist at his side, this 
13 one is in his waistband under his shirt, and he was 
14 like this. Just coming straight at me like he was 
15 going to run right through me. And when he gets 
16 about that 8 to 10 feet away, I look down, I 
17 remember looking at my sites and firing, all I see 
18 is his head and that's what I shot. 
19 I don't know how many, I know at 
20 least once because I saw the last one go into him. 
21 And then when it went into him, the demeanor on his 
22 face went blank, the aggression was gone, it was 
23 gone, I mean, I knew he stopped, the threat was 
24 stopped. 
25 When he fell, he fell on his face.

2 much momentum carrying him forward that when he 
3 fell, his feet kind of came up a little bit and then 
4 they rested.

21 mike was probably in my lap at some point. 
22 
23 Q 
MS. ALIZADEH: The mike, okay. 
(By Ms. Whirley) All right. So you're in 
24 the car, you fire two shots and he's running and you 
25 get out of the car to chase after him and tell us

4 him. 
5 
A 
Q 
A 
When I'm chasing him? 
Yes. You get out of the car and run after 
My main goal was to keep eyes on him and 
6 just to keep him contained until I had people coming 
7 there. I knew I had already called for backup and I 
8 knew they were already in the area for the stealing 
9 that was originally reported. So I thought if I can 
10 buy 30 seconds of time, that was my original goal 
11 when I tried to get him to come to the car. If I 
12 could buy 30 seconds of time, someone else will be 
13 here, we can make the arrest, nothing happens, we 
14 are all good. And it didn't happen that way. 
15 So when he ran, you know, just stay 
16 with him, someone is going to be here, you know, 
17 we'll get him. 
18 Q And when you, when the second shot was 
19 fired inside the car, did you think he was hit at 
20 all? 
21 
22 
23 him? 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
No, I thought I missed. 
Both shots. You didn't see any blood on 
The first shot, judging by his reaction, 
25 he went back, I thought it went through the door and

1 hit him in the leg, in the hip, is what I thought. 
2 
3 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
The second one I saw the cloud of dust and 
4 him running, I knew I missed. 
5 Q Okay. So you got out of the car, you are 
6 running, you are telling him to stop; is that right? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And he's not listening? 
9 A No, not until he gets to that light pole 
10 and that's when he stopped. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
To what now? 
He gets to that light pole at that 
13 intersection.

Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Are you firing at him while he's running? 
No, ma'am. 
Is Dorian Johnson anywhere around? 
I never saw him after the very beginning. 
18 Once he walked past my car, I never saw him again. 
19 Q Okay. All right. And at some point you 
20 say Michael Brown does turn around? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Any idea what happened to make him turn 
23 around or he just all of the sudden turns around? 
24 A No, just turns around. His whole reaction 
25 to the whole thing was something I've never seen.

1 I've never seen that much aggression so quickly from 
2 a simple request to just walk on the sidewalk. 
3 Q Okay. Because you never did talk to him 
4 about the Cigarillos or the stealing at the Ferguson 
5 Market? 
6 A No, I never had the chance to. 
7 Q All right. You said when he's coming back 
8 at you with his hand, right hand in his waistband 
9 and kind of charging, that's when you fired the last 
10 shots? 
A 11 Yes, ma'am. 
12 And he went down? Q 
A 13 Yes, ma'am.

What did you do after that when he goes 
After that is when I got back on the radio 
19 and I said, "send me a supervisor and every car you 
20 have." 
21 Seconds later, I don't know how many 
22 
23 
seconds later, is when Officer followed by 
Officer arrived. And I believe they were the 
24 ones that were assigned to the stealing call 
25 originally. walked up to me and said,

1 Darren, what do you need. 
2 
3 A 
MS. ALIZADEH: Said what? 
Darren, what do you need. I don't 
4 remember what my reply was and he said, did you call 
5 for an ambulance. I said I haven't, will you. I 
6 remember him calling twice, like he was about from 
7 me to you away on the radio calling. 
8 And then I look across and was 
9 starting to tape off the area, but I notice that all 
10 of our cars are parked this way, Brown is laying 
11 here, there is nothing on this side. I told 
12 to move his car to this side to block that side of 
13 the street off. He did that and then he resumed 
14 taping. 
15 After that I walked to my car and I 
16 put my gun up, I start walking away from the scene. 
17 As I'm walking away, I walk back to my car and I 
18 don't know if the door was open or shut, I think it 
19 was shut. I open the door, I reach in, I turn my 
20 car off, shut the door. At that time my sergeant 
21 pulled up and I walked over to him.

1 conversation, he said something first, but I said I 
2 have to tell you what happened. And he goes, what 
3 happened. 
4 I said, I had to kill him. 
5 He goes, you what? 
6 I said, he grabbed my gun, I shot 
7 him, I killed him. 
8 He goes, go sit in the car. 
9 I said, I cannot sit in the car. 
10 I remember him saying, Darren, sit in 
11 the car. 
12 I said, Sarge, I can't be singled 
13 out. It is already getting hostile, I can't be 
14 singled out in the car. I will leave if you want me 
15 to leave. 
16 He said, take my car and leave. So I 
17 got in his car and I drove to the police station. 
18 Q In your mind him grabbing the gun is what 
19 made the difference where you felt you had to use a 
20 weapon to stop him? 
21 A Yes. Once he was hitting me in the face, 
22 that enough, was in my mind to authorize the use of 
23 force. 
24 Q Okay. So if he would not have grabbed 
25 your gun while he was hitting you in the face,

15 
A

Correct. 
And do you hear what the crowd is saying? 
16 I know you are in a pretty stressful situation, but 
17 do you understand or hearing anything that they're 
18 saying? 
19 A I hear yelling, I hear screaming, as I'm 
20 walking back to my car, a white Ford truck pulled up 
21 and I remember her saying is that so and so? It was 
22 a female driver that got out. said, ma'am, 
23 we don't know. I heard her say, I think it is so 
24 and so, and then she screamed and that's all I 
25 heard.

1 I could hear other noises and 
2 screaming, but I couldn't hear. 
3 Q Okay. We're going to go with you to the 
4 station in just a minute, but I wanted to ask you 
5 about your relationship with the residents in the 
6 Canfield Green Apartments. 
7 A Uh-huh. 
8 Q Did you guys have a volatile, well, how 
9 can I put this. Did you not really get along well 
10 with the folks that lived in that apartment, not you 
11 personally, I mean the police in general? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
It is an antipolice area for sure. 
And when you say antipolice, tell me more? 
There's a lot of gangs that reside or 
15 associate with that area. There's a lot of violence 
16 in that area, there's a lot of gun activity, drug 
17 activity, it is just not a very well-liked 
18 community. That community doesn't like the police. 
19 Q Were you pretty much on high alert being 
20 in that community by yourself, especially when 
21 Michael Brown said, "fuck what you say," I think he 
22 said? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
You were on pretty high alert at that 
25 point knowing the vicinity and the area that you're

1 in? 
2 A Yes, that's not an area where you can take 
3 anything really lightly. Like I said, it is a 
4 hostile environment. There are good people over 
5 there, there really are, but I mean there is an 
6 influx of gang activity in that area. 
7 Q All right. So you're driving yourself 
8 back to Ferguson, what are you thinking on the drive 
9 back to Ferguson? 
10 A I think I'm just kind of in shock of what 
11 just happened, I really didn't believe it because 
12 like I said, the whole thing started over will you 
13 just walk on the sidewalk and it developed into that 
14 in 45 seconds. 
15 And that's the only other thing I 
16 remember thinking about is I heard the car radio 
17 going off and mine wasn't. That doesn't make sense. 
18 So I hit the scan button on mine thinking the scan 
19 button got messed up, I wasn't getting everything. 
20 And I did that and it still, this one 
21 is going off and mine's not. So then I looked at it 
22 and I was on channel 3. I was like, I don't know 
23 what was heard or what wasn't heard. 
24 Q And that's when you realized that you 
25 probably, nobody probably even heard your call for
