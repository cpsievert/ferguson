13 here and they were kind of just a little bit, I'm

5 Northwinds from that way, that is the way he was 
6 coming. 
7 He had no signal light on and then he 
8 just stopped. He didn't stop all the way because he 
9 still had, his car was still running, he just had, 
10 like you just know how you pull up to somebody and 
11 you switch to put on your brake and he was talking 
12 to them. 
13 Q Okay. So you observed the vehicle come up 
14 to the boys and you said it looked like they're 
15 talking. You could see their hands moving and 
16 stuff? 
17 A Yeah, that's all I could see was movement.

14 Q Okay. 
15 A He catches up with them, by then the boys, 
16 the little one, he's kind of away from, he was not 
17 at the window, he's kind of walking away. The 
18 bigger guy was having some kind of interaction with 
19 the cop.

21 you described that you could see their hands going 
22 back and forth?

A 
Q 
A 
Well, he was out of my sight. 
Okay.

3 
A 
Q 
At the window, yeah. 
Okay. So when you said the boy broke 
4 away, did he step backwards or did he turn back from 
5 the vehicle and walk away or did you see any of 
6 that? 
7 A Urn, all I saw was whatever they were 
8 engaged in, obviously, must have been over or 
9 somebody was able to get their hand off of each 
10 other and the boy walked away. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
He kind of walked away not real slow, but 
13 not real fast. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A And that's when the policeman got out of 
16 the car.

1 going before the incident with the policeman. 
2 Q Okay. So at this point you see the 
3 officer get out of the patrol car? 
4 A Uh-huh.

1 and get out. 
2 
3 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
So I'm saying whatever time it took him to 
4 get, because if you are sitting in a vehicle you 
5 have to step out, get out, and he come out kind of 
6 almost at a run. He come out kind of fast. 
7 Q And at the time that the officer came out 
8 of the vehicle, did he then move in the direction 
9 that you saw the boy moving in? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh, that same direction. 
At the time that officer got out of the 
12 vehicle and you said started, you said kind of

16 
17 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
Could you still see the big boy? 
No. 
When the officer began running in that 
18 direction on Canfield, could you see if he had a 
19 gun? 
20 A I could see his left side and I don't 
21 know, I'm not sure if he had anything, but he held 
22 his hand like he had something in his hand and I 
23 could not see it. 
24 Q You are motioning with your right hand.

1 something? 
2 A He might have had something, but I did not 
3 see it. It can if you get out you have something in 
4 your hand, you carry in your hand a little bit 
5 differently, so I don't really see it then. 
6 Q Okay. Did the police officer then move 
7 quickly or return out of your sight? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Out of my sight. 
And then how long after you lost sight of 
10 police officer did you hear some gunshots? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
13 been four? 
14 A 
A couple seconds. 
You said it was more than two, could have 
It could have been. It was kind of 
15 shocking to hear it because it was such a minor, 
16 thought minor thing that I saw before the gunshots. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 A And so I know I heard pow, pow, pow, and 
19 then I just said, you know, how you say it, I don't 
20 believe this, can't be a shooting back here. 
21 Q So at this point everything that you see 
22 at this point are you still looking out the same

FAX 314-241-6750

1 window and you saw the officer and the bag boy out 
2 of your the window? 
3 A I moved away from the window. 
4 Q When did you move away from the window? 
5 A After the policeman went down and when I 
6 heard the shot. 
7 Q Okay. But before then had you been at the 
8 window the whole time, from the time when you first 
9 saw the boys talking to the time you moved away, or 
10 did you like step away and get your cell phone and 
11 then come back to the window? 
A No. 12 
13 Q You were at the window the whole time that 
14 you said you were watching this. Do you understand 
15 my question? 
16 A Yeah, I understand your question. What 
17 I'm trying to say was, when I saw the boys, I kind 
18 of backed away from the window a little. When I 
19 kind of just look back, I didn't really go back, I 
20 kind of look back and that's when I saw the police 
21 car. That's the only time I'm at the window until 
22 the cop moved. 
23 Q Okay. And now you said after you heard 
24 the shots, you didn't see the shooting, you said you

1 A Yeah. I just had on some shorts and 
2 things in the house, so I couldn't go out like that. 
3 I just put on my pants and went out. 
4 Q You went outside? 
5 A Yes. I'm hearing the shots and then I'm 
6 seeing people, you kind of could hear too, you know. 
7 I heard the shots and then I said, I saw people, you 
8 could hear people by then, people were kind of 
9 screaming. 
10 So I could hear them through the 
11 window. So that's when I put my clothes on to go 
12 out. 
13 Q Okay. So other than the shots, you 
14 couldn't hear anything that was going on between the 
15 boys and the officer? 
16 A No. 
17 Q You didn't hear anybody yelling or say 
18 anything that maybe you couldn't make out? 
19 
20

Q 
No. 
And so when you left your apartment, did 
21 you go down to Canfield Drive, did you see the boys? 
22 A I had just come out of my apartment, still 
23 in the apartment lot. I had never left the parking 
24 lot where I could see. I wasn't going to get too 
25 close to that, so I stayed back.

13 one that was in the confrontation. He was putting 
14 out some cones, put some cones down to make sure

13 Q Did it appear to you that the people that 
14 were beginning to gather, were they becoming angry 
15 or agitated?

23 A Not really, except for the fact that I'm

1 stay. It wasn't the best in the first place, but 
2 now it's like you get all kind of elements, people 
3 are always there, it is just bad. 
4 Q Have you, do you think that people in that 
5 area know that you've seen this, do you talk to your 
6 neighbors about it? 
7 A No, and the reason for that was that's the 
8 only reason why I agreed to make a statement was, 
9 and that's why we did it the way we did it. He said 
10 it was the safest way. He didn't want to put me in 
11 harms way was for me to go to the FBI rather than, I 
12 told him I wasn't going to talk to Ferguson. 
13 Q And why is that? Did you have any prior 
14 experiences with the Ferguson Police Department that 
15 would make you feel that way?

1 that was involved in the shooting. I have to kind 
2 of give you a background on me. I don't have a lot 
3 of interaction with policemen. 
4 I think I've gotten a ticket twice 
5 and they were completely out of my area. Anything 
6 else, I just don't get involved with them. I do 
7 what I'm supposed to do, try to follow what I'm 
8 supposed to do. I work, I work most of the time, 
9 I'm gone five days a week, most of the time working. 
10 And when I'm home, when I'm there in that apartment, 
11 I stay in my apartment, I mind my own business. 
12 I know of maybe one or two of the 
13 neighbors that's in the apartments. I speak to them 
14 and I keep going. 
15 But I sit in my apartment, I see the 
16 police coming down the streets. I have a problem 
17 with them doing 50, 60 miles an hour coming down the 
18 complex where you've got children and people walking 
19 all the time and it is five, six, seven, eight cops 
20 and they're all speeding down the street. Less than 
21 five minutes later you see them coming back. You 
22 see them, they all pull up into the parking lot and 
23 there will be, oh, I don't know in these funny 
24 looking suits and playing cards. 
25 They surround the parking lot to go

1 in, and they go into some apartment, and I don't 
2 know which one, and then they come back out. I 
3 mean, it is just a lot of things that go on. 
4 Frankly, I'm really not use to this. 
5 This is my first experience with an apartment. I've 
6 always lived in a house and never lived in an 
7 apartment before. 
8 And the things that go on, you know, 
9 make me kind of leery of the police because they, 
10 when they come in, if you come to go get in your 
11 car, get back in your apartment, get back in your 
12 apartment. When there is really nothing going on. 
13 If you got a warrant for somebody to 
14 go in or something, you know, it is for you to talk 
15 to people. The little bit that I did do interaction 
16 that I did see with them, the tone, the way they 
17 talk to you, the way they approach you. 
18 I had a couple of them knock on my 
19 door because they was looking for somebody. You 
20 knock on my door and you want me to give some 
21 information, there is certain way you talk to me. 
22 I'm not violating anybody.
