13 seeing it on a weekend or evening or taking a field 
14 trip to the police academy to exit there. So you 
15 guys can talk about that as well. 
16 Sheila has a better recollection than me, 
17 so I have to always ask her did I forget everything. 
18 
19 
MS. WHIRLEY: She has the gift of grab. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I do. I'm the mouth and 
20 she's the brains. So you all had asked for a 
21 topographical map at some point, I have one that I 
22 will pass out today. Don't know how helpful it is 
23 going to be for you. I looked at it, I don't know. 
24 It is the only one that we can come up with without 
25 actually, you know, I guess hiring a company to go

1 out there and do that. 
2 And then also you had asked for the floor 
3 plans of the apartments in the complex, I've got 
4 that as well. 
5 Also, there was a question about whether 
6 or not we were going to call Dr. , the 
7 pathologist who was hired by the family of Michael 
8 Brown to perform an independent autopsy. It was 
9 actually the second autopsy on the remains. 
10 There was then later a third autopsy that 
11 was done by the Department of Defense medical 
12 examiners, which I expect we'll call one of them to 
13 tell you what their findings were. 
14 We have contacted the attorney who 
15 represents the family of Michael Brown and asked 
16 that they contact Dr. and invite him to 
17 testify. 
18 So we haven't heard back if he's going to 
19 be available to do that, or if he's willing to do 
20 that, but we're going to make those efforts to try 
21 to get him here because I know that there was a 
22 question about that. 
23 What would I do without Sheila. Now, as I 
24 said, we have potentially 15 more eyewitnesses who 
25 may be testifying. And it's been our habit and our

1 process during this time to play for you every 
2 recorded statement that a witness has made. 
3 We initially were, our goal and plan was 
4 to do that before the witness testified, sometimes 
5 that didn't work out, but we've always gotten around 
6 to playing it eventually for you. 
7 As you know, sometimes these witnesses 
8 make two or three recorded statements, sometimes 
9 you've got, you know, statements that are in excess 
10 of an hour, hour and a half, hour and 40 minutes, 
11 two hours. 
12 And so our question to you is we can 
13 proceed in that manner as we've done in the past or 
14 we're wondering if you find it helpful to listen to 
15 those statements if those statements are consistent 
16 with what the witness testifies to. 
17 So if the witness testifies, like if we 
18 put a witness on and they testify, and Sheila and I 
19 who have listened to these tapes feel that there's 
20 really no inconsistency in what they already said. 
21 I mean, obviously, any statement there could be, you 
22 know, minor inconsistencies, and that will be 
23 something that she and I will discuss together about 
24 whether we think that there are inconsistencies. 
25 And if we feel that there are not, it

Page 15 
1 would be possible if you feel that that doesn't help 
2 you to hear this tape statement again, that we then 
3 just forgo playing that taped statement. 
4 Obviously, it takes up a lot of time and I 
5 know it is tiring for you all to sit here and listen 
6 and read transcripts. 
7 So maybe you can discuss that during your 
8 lunch as well. If you think that that would be a 
9 way to go to try to speed through this. I don't 
10 mean speed through it in a way that's not efficient. 
11 I don't want to say we're rushing through anything, 
12 but if you are finding that it is not really that 
13 helpful and you don't need to hear it, then we don't 
14 have to play it. 
15 We have it, we have all of them and, of 
16 course, if at any time you would have some issue 
17 with, you know what, maybe we should hear that 
18 witness' statement that they made before, at any 
19 time we can play it for you, okay. So that's 
20 something for you to consider. All right. 
21 Is there anything, you know, that anybody 
22 has an issue or question about? You can discuss 
23 this during your lunch and then we'll ask questions 
24 during the lunch break, especially if we are talking 
25 about scheduling issues and things of that nature.

1 Don't necessarily need to afford those kind of 
2 things, but let me know after lunch and we have, I 
3 think, two people here right now, and going to have 
4 to give me a second to get somewhat organized. 
5 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. 
7 Officer Wilson, he only 
8 had one recorded statement? I know we only heard 
9 one, if I'm not mistaken. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: If I'm not mistaken, 
11 Officer Wilson's statement was not recorded prior to 
12 him testifying. Check your folders to see if you 
13 have a transcript of the testimony of Darren Wilson? 
14 We have one. 
15 There was supposed to have 
16 been one with Detective 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Detective did one that 
18 wasn't recorded and then there was one that was 
19 recorded, you have a transcript of that? 
20 We have one that is 
21 recorded. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: My recollection is, we can 
23 certainly go back and look at the transcripts, but 
24 that Sergeant testified about statements that 
25 he made right at the scene when he first got there,

1 and none of that was recorded. And then 
2 was the detective who went to the police 
3 station and did a cursory interview and that was not 
4 recorded. And then, you have one? 
5 That must have been done on the 9th at 
6 10:00 in the morning? 
7 August lOth. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: lOth, okay. The 9th is the 
9 day of. I knew it was the next morning. All right. 
10 And then there was Agent who came 
11 in and testified that she had interviewed him, but 
12 that their interview was not recorded, I believe. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Right.

additional questions, you just 
We put on things in a way that 
for you to understand the case, 
the sake of when we put on a 
the process and then now later 
23 in the process you might think well, I didn't know 
24 that when I heard from that witness before, so now I 
25 have a couple of additional questions.

1 So if anyone of you feel the need to have 
2 any witness who has testified previously return and 
3 answer some questions, we will get them here. And 
4 obviously, Officer Wilson, I cannot compel him to 
5 appear before you, but he appeared previously and I 
6 would reach out to his representatives to invite him 
7 back if you felt that you would want to hear from 
8 him again. 
9 Any other questions? 
10 Is there any 
11 recorded testimony with Officer Darren Wilson and 
12 the FBI or the civil rights investigation? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: My understanding is, no, 
14 that they did not record that. If you recall it was 
15 the brunette female FBI agent 
16 who came in and testified that she was present and 
17 interviewed him that they did not record that. 
18 I know, now this is 
19 reported in the newspaper or whatever, there was a 
20 statement that was supposedly made by him about the 
21 first two shots. In our transcripts he didn't think 
22 he hit him on the second shot because he saw some 
23 dirt fly up. But then it was reported later on that 
24 he said he thought he did hit him with the second 
25 shot. I just wondered if there was any recorded

1 evidence of him saying that? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Not that I'm aware of. And 
3 I will tell you that, you know, as you can probably 
4 imagine, any news agency is not going to reveal to 
5 me who the source of their information is. They 
6 have this First Amendment thing, freedom of the 
7 press. 
8 And so while it might be -- make sense for 
9 me to call them and say, hey, where did you get that 
10 because we're interested and if you've heard that 
11 from another source, we'd like to hear who told you 
12 that, but they're not going to tell me. 
13 And that might be something that if you 
14 would care to have another witness back to testify 
15 to ask that question, but I don't know where that 
16 information came from for that particular news 
17 article. 
18 Two quick 
19 things. One, Grand Jury Exhibit Number 2 is the map 
20 that we use almost daily. I notice also it still 
21 says not to scale. Do you know if you would ever 
22 get one to scale or even if it is that much of a 
23 difference? 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: That's another thing. That 
25 brings up something else. There was a question

Page 20 
1 awhile back about getting a transparency that maybe 
2 would have the diagram images that we could lay on 
3 top of the map. I did look into that and the 
4 problem that I learned with doing that is that map 
5 is not to scale and so just because on the map I'm 
6 holding my fingers out, if the map says this is 
7 137 feet, I'm just making up a number, of course. 
8 There might be another place on the map that says 
9 this is 150 feet. And the actual measurement was 
10 accurately done, but the map might not be to scale, 
11 you know, the entrance, the driveway, you know, to 
12 some of these parking entrances might not be as wide 
13 in real life as it appears on the diagram. The size 
14 of the police vehicle is not necessarily on the 
15 diagram the exact size of what it is in the street. 
16 I would suggest that, you know, I have all 
17 of those crime scene photos and if you ever are 
18 curious about, you know, the real size of things, 
19 you can sift through those photos to see if they can 
20 help you determine or answer some of those 
21 questions, but I can ask about the possibility of 
22 having a diagram to scale. 
23 It is my, this is strictly my belief based 
24 upon my experience that when the police officers do 
25 these diagrams, they use a computer program that, I 
FAX 314-241-6750

Grand Jury, Volume XV October 23, 2014 
Page 21 
1 don't think they are done freehand, I think they use 
2 a computer program to do these diagrams. And so to 
3 do one to scale would require someone, actually, a 
4 draftsman type of person, I think, to actually make 
5 sure that the diagram is to scale. 
6 So that would probably have to be done by 
7 not the police department, we probably would have to 
8 look into whether or not there could be some 
9 draftsman that could do that, but I mean, I can 
10 investigate that as well if you think it would be 
11 helpful. 
12 But as far as the transparency goes, I'm 
13 afraid it might even be misleading if we had a 
14 transparency and you laid it on top of the aerial 
15 photograph, it might appear that oh, look, this is 
16 actually not where it is in the picture because on 
17 the transparency it is past the fire hydrant. Well, 
18 that just might be because it is not to scale. So I 
19 wouldn't want you to rely on something and be misled 
20 by that. 
21 Yes. 
22 Prior to knowing 
23 I was on this case, I remember vaguely hearing in 
24 the news there was a gentleman on some sort of audio 
25 phone that recorded the succession of gunshots and

1 didn't know, again, I didn't pay much attention to 
2 it, I kept it in my memory. I didn't know if that 
3 was something even credible or something we will get 
4 to. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. That is something 
6 that the police have the custody of that recording 
7 and we will be putting that on for you as well. 
8 And there was a question quite some time 
9 ago about surveillance cameras in the complex and I, 
10 believe me, before you guys even got this 
11 assignment, that was one of the first questions out 
12 of my mouth. Are their surveillance cameras? I was 
13 told no. 
14 Now, before you complete your 
15 investigation, probably the very last witness that I 
16 will call for you to hear from is going to be 
17 Detective , because as the primary case agent, 
18 he knows more about this case than any other person. 
19 So there are some things that he's going 
20 to testify about that he did himself and whatnot, 
21 but he would be the person to ask a lot of these 
22 questions to because he was in charge of the 
23 investigation. 
24 What was done, what did you do about this, 
25 did you ever try to get ahold of this person, he can

1 answer a lot of those questions with firsthand 
2 knowledge. 
3 Me, all my knowledge about this comes from 
4 other sources because I was not out there 
5 investigating the case. So I don't want to be the 
6 person to actually have you rely on what I'm telling 
7 you, I'm just telling you that it is my 
8 understanding that there were not, but that would be 
9 a question better put to Detective about 
10 that, all right? 
11 Anyone else? 
12 Okay. We have a witness here, the first 
13 witness we are going to call and I'm not organized 
14 this morning. 
15 I know 
16 that had asked sometime ago would it 
17 be possible for us to see where this happened. And 
18 I know we had discussed it before and that probably 
19 wouldn't be in our best interest to go there. I 
20 think somebody had talked 
21 I think it was 
22 
23 About getting pictures of 
24 the distance and things like that? 
25

1 we've had that done. I think that Detective 
2 when I put him on last we're going to have him show 
3 you those pictures because he'll be able to point 
4 out for you in the picture this apartment building 
5 right here or this window right here, this balcony 
6 right here, that's where witness so and so was. And 
7 if you see right here, that's where witness so and 
8 so was because he's the one that knows that 
9 information and in very intimate detail. 
10 So we do have pictures that we have the 
11 police and Detective went out with them to 
12 take those pictures to make sure we got the vantage 
13 points. We weren't able to take vantage point 
14 pictures from where the witness was that would 
15 require going into people's apartments and they felt 
16 that that wasn't going to be safe or welcomed. 
17 So the pictures that they took are from 
18 the location of where the vehicle was, the location 
19 of where Michael Brown's body laying in the street 
20 and then the location of the corner near a light 
21 post. And those pictures are done in 360, so you 
22 might be able to see from here can you see that 
23 witness' balcony who says they can see this. That's 
24 the best we can do as far as getting vantage point 
25 pictures.

1 I guess I do have a 
2 question. I know that some of these media reports 
3 they're saying that he had marijuana in his system. 
4 And I guess that's another way of knowing it didn't 
5 come from us because we were never told that he had 
6 marijuana in his system. 
7 So is there still like evidence out there 
8 that we haven't heard like that? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. 9 
10 
11 
The DNA on the gun? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yes, there's going to be, 
12 you know, our plan was to try to get through the 
13 eyewitnesses and then at the end put on some of the 
14 scientific evidence because frankly those witnesses 
15 are there at my fingertips and are going to come in 
16 whenever I tell them to come in. 
17 And so I just knew that when it came time 
18 to try to wrap things up, we would be able to get 
19 them through in and out fairly quickly. So I do

Page 31 
And this was August 9th, and I know that 
2 it got warmer in the day, but do you recall if you 
3 had your windows opened or closed? 
4 A Closed. 
5 Q Do you normally run the air conditioning 
6 in the month of August? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q Okay. And so you said that you were 
9 looking out the window, was there a reason you 
10 looked out the window? Was there anything that drew 
11 your attention outside or were you just happening to 
12 be working out the window? 
13 A I just happen to be looking out. 
14 Q All right. And then once you were looking 
15 out, did you see something unusual? 
16 A Not unusual at first. 
17 Q Why don't you describe what you saw? 
18 A Urn, these two boys or two guys walking 
19 down the street. They were kind of out in the 
20 street, but not all the way out. They weren't quite 
21 to the yellow line. 
22 Then I kind of stepped back a little 
23 bit. Then for some reason I looked again and I saw 
24 the police car pull up, and he said something to the 
25 boys. They, obviously, said something back because

1 you could see the motion of their hands, but I 
2 couldn't hear anything because my window was closed. 
3 Then the boys kind of went on, walked 
4 on and then he backed up, the cop backed up, the 
5 policeman backed up. 
6 Then, I guess, I'm not sure what else 
7 happened after that, but I could see the one boy, 
8 the shorter one, he kind of stepped a little bit 
9 past the window of the police car. It was actually 
10 an SUV, it wasn't just a regular car, but the bigger 
11 guy was standing at the window, near the window of 
12 the car. And I could see the top of his head and I 
13 could see their hands moving. And so it seemed like 
14 they were kind of, I guess, tussling through the 
15 window of the car. 
16 Then the boy, the guy broke loose and 
17 began to go down the street and that's when the 
18 policeman got out of the car. Then he proceeded, 
19 the boy was ahead of him and that's all I could see. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Because they were past, they were past my 
22 building. See, like my building is here, well, I 
23 couldn't see, I could only see the police car and 
24 him going so far. I could not see after it passed. 
25 They I said, urn, in a few seconds I heard a shot. I

1 don't know whether it was three or four because I 
2 really did not necessarily count them, but I knew it 
3 was more than two. Oh, my God. I don't guess, you 
4 know, they were shooting. This had anything to do 
5 with it and I just went on back and started to put 
6 my clothes on. 
7 By that time the crowd of people had 
8 started, people had started to come, not a lot of 
9 them but, you know, I knew something had happened. 
10 So by the time I got out, it was all over. The boy 
11 was in the street and the police was beginning to 
12 put some cones out. 
13 Q Okay. So let's, you know, we're going to 
14 need to go back. We're going to go through step by 
15 step and ask some more detailed questions, okay?

No, I was there by myself. 
And so when you said you happen to look 
24 out the window, was it the sliding glass door or was 
25 it a bedroom window?

Q 
Blinds. 
Are they horizontal blinds? 
Yes. 
And were they, were the blinds down? 
No, I had it pulled up so high because I 
you know, looking out. Sometimes I just 
to see what's going on, you know. 
So did you have to move the blinds in 
you to see out the window? 
No. 
Okay. 
Because they were high enough and by me 
high, I can see on the street, so. 
And so, and that's a good point. When 
18 you're on the third floor of this building, is there 
19 a little rise, is this a little bit on a hill 
20 somewhat, a small hill? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
The street? You mean my building? 
Does the ground, is there any elevation to 
23 this, like if you are driving up here and if you 
24 walk up to your building, are you walking uphill at 
25 all?

17 tell me anything about them? 
18 A One was short, he had dreads, he was 
19 darker skin. The other one was a big guy, over 
20 6 feet. You know, he was just a big guy that's 
21 basically. I couldn't say whether he was -- the 
22 only thing I can say was he was a big guy and that 
23 he was a lighter skin than the smaller one and that 
24 the smaller one had dreads. Because of the fact 
25 that I wasn't that close, I couldn't give you

1 details of what they look like. 
2 Q Okay. You refer to them as boys. I want 
3 to ask you if you have an opinion as to how old they 
4 were? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
Well, I knew they were all under 25. 
Okay. 
One of them seemed like he might have been 
8 close to 18, 19 years old, the bigger one. He was a 
9 big guy, he didn't really look that old. The other 
10 one he looked, I don't know, maybe he could have 
11 been just a year or so older than the other one. As 
12 far as the size and the way they were dressed, and 
13 what have you. 
14 Q Did you, at this point now do you recall 
15 any time when you have seen either of them in the 
16 apartment complex before that day? 
17 A Not to my knowledge I haven't seen them. 
18 Q And so how about how they were dressed or 
19 what they were wearing, do you have any memory of 
20 what either one of them had on? 
21 A Not specific. I really didn't pay that 
22 much attention to it. All I know is that they were, 
23 let's see, I really didn't pay that much attention 
24 to them. Just had normal clothes on. 
25 Q Okay.

1 A I wasn't specifically looking for 
2 anything. 
3 Q Sure. 
4 A As far as they were concerned they were 
5 just people walking down, two guys walking down the 
6 street. 
7 Q And was that unusual that there would be 
8 two older teenagers walking down the street? 
9 A No, no. It's an apartment complex and 
10 there is apartments on each side. There are 
11 families, there are a lot of youngsters living in 
12 the apartment complex at this point. When I first 
13 moved in, there wasn't quite as many males, younger 
14 males in the apartment. 
15 So you see them all day. You just 
16 see them when I'm home, you know. 
17 Q Hanging out, walking around? 
18 A Hanging out, they're walking around, what 
19 is it, they are interacting with each other. 
20 Sometimes they have cars parked, they are sitting on 
21 cars. I don't really pay a whole lot of attention. 
22 Q Sure. 
23 A It is just that particular morning, which 
24 I do every morning, I just look out. It is really 
25 more of a safety thing. If I'm going to leave out

1 of my house, out of my apartment, I want to know 
2 what is surrounding me. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A So I don't really always look at features 
5 and clothing they have on, this kind of thing. I 
6 know this little guy with the dreads, he was so much 
7 shorter than the bigger guy. 
8 Q Okay. And when you saw them, can you use 
9 that laser pointer and show me where on the map here 
10 the boys were when you first saw them. Were they on 
11 Canfield Drive? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Can you use that and show me where you 
14 first saw them? 
15 A They were on this, let me see. They were 
16 kind of, this map is really confusing me because 
17 they were on this side of the street. 
18 Q Okay. I don't know if that's, that might 
19 be pointing up to high? 
20 A I'm just saying they were on this side of 
21 the street.
