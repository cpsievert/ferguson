1 municipalities to be able to communicate together in 
2 some type of event. 
3 Q All right. And are you aware of how many 
4 RIOT channels there are in St. Louis County? 
5 A There's a RIOT A, B, C, D and E, so a 
6 total of five. 
7 Q Okay. Now, when a police department 
8 purchases and installs a radio system, are the 
9 channels uniform throughout each municipality or 
10 does each municipal decide what channels they want? 
11 A They mostly decide which one they want. 
12 There is mostly a standard that every radio has at 
13 least RIOT A. Some will put RIOT B in, some won't. 
14 Some will just keep RIOT A their preference. 
15 Q So would it be, for example, I'm just 
16 saying this, for example, like channel one might be 
17 the dispatch channel? 
18 A That's always usually the dispatch 
19 channel. 
20 Q Okay. And then what other kind of 
21 channels are there for the radio? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
There's a mutual aid channel. 
Mutual aid? 
Right, which is once again kind of an 
25 inoperability type of channel, most every radio

1 within the state, mutual aid channel. There's a 
2 point-to-point and that's used for dispatchers to be 
3 able to talk to other dispatch centers. It is 
4 always in that as receive only. The licenses set up 
5 for base station transmission only, no portable 
6 radios can talk on it so they don't interfere with 
7 the radio traffic being transmitted to each of the 
8 different dispatch centers. 
9 Q So if an officer has his radio on the 
10 point-to-point channel, he can hear other 
11 dispatchers that might be talking to each other? 
12 A As long as he's within the range of that 
13 transmitter. 
14 Q Okay. We'll talk about the range in a 
15 second, but that's the purpose of that?

17

Q 
A 
Q 
Right. 
They can hear it, but they can't transmit? 
That's correct. 
Okay. And so what about the RIOT channel 
20 now, how does that work. If someone got on the RIOT 
21 channel, who can they talk to? 
22 A Urn, as long as the neighboring 
23 municipality, they have it set up to have some type 
24 of DWI checkpoints or something like that, they 
25 would use it.

1 Q So if, for example, the president or 
2 vice-president was going to visit St. Louis and the 
3 St. Louis County Police Department was going to 
4 provide security for that visit, would they use the 
5 RIOT channel for a period of time? 
6 A Definitely they would secure that channel 
7 for that event. 
8 Q And so if any municipality or anybody that 
9 has these radios can talk on the RIOT channel, how 
10 is it that they know not to use it if, for example, 
11 there is a presidential visit? 
12 A There's pretty much a notice that goes out 
13 through St. Louis County saying between this date 
14 and this date, you know, that's going to be used for 
15 the president coming to town. They even have it set 
16 up for the one golf tournament at one of the country 
17 clubs that they do security with they might secure 
18 that channel for that. 
19 Ballwin Days, they would request the 
20 St. Louis County, we have Ballwin Days going, can we 
21 use the RIOT channel, and they usually approve it 
22 unless there's something, an event that's going to 
23 happen, they will reserve it. 
24 Q It can be used for preplanned events, what 
25 about events that are not preplanned?

1 A That's kind of a go-to if you are on it 
2 using it for an event and something larger comes, 
3 everybody goes to a different channel. 
4 Q So, for example, if there was a hostage 
5 situation that was occurring in South County and the 
6 County Police had mobilized and their attack unit 
7 was on scene and various precincts maybe have been 
8 called in for this situation. Would that be 
9 something they would advise all of those officers to 
10 turn to the RIOT channel? 
11 A Definitely, that is the go-to channel 
12 basically. 
13 Q So the theory is at that time the officers 
14 that are using RIOT channel are all using it for the 
15 same purpose, they all know what's going on, they 
16 are there for that particular event? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q So now, let's talk about, we talked about 
19 when possibly a call could be received and not 
20 received. And you and I met last week and you kind 
21 of had to educate me on a lot of this, but we talked 
22 about the fact that whether or not a call can be 
23 received by somebody might, in part, be determined 
24 by signal strength, correct? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Correct.

Q So given that the walkie-talkies? 
A 5 watts. 
1 
2 
3 Q 5 watts. That's a lower signal strength 
4 than the mobile radios in the cars, correct? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q And then how many watts does the 
7 dispatcher has? 
8 A The dispatcher, most of all in St. Louis 
9 County their base stations, their transmitters are 
10 at least 100 watts. 
11 Q Okay. And so there is another thing that 
12 might affect whether or not a transmission is 
13 received is the distance away from the dispatch 
14 transmitter that the radio is, correct? 
15 A Correct. It is kind of a line of sight. 
16 So anything in between this antenna and that 
17 dispatch center can reduce the radio transmission to 
18 that receiver. So if there is a building, even 
19 trees, large thick trees, any steel structure 
20 reduces that capability of that transmitter to get 
21 to that receiver. 
22 Q What about the height of the antenna, does 
23 that also affect the transmission? 
24 A Yes. And especially if a portable radio. 
25 Being on your hip can reduce that 5 watts to almost

1 half if it is touching your body or if this officer 
2 is a large person, that can really cut down the 
3 power. 
4 Q Okay. So would it be uncommon then that 
5 maybe an officer who is using his portable 
6 walkie-talkie could call out and transmit something 
7 and the dispatch not hear him? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, very much so. 
Okay. Also, we talked about the different 
10 powers and strengths of these radios, is it possible 
11 for other officers when they're on say the dispatch 
12 channel, can an officer in car A hear officer in car 
13 B transmitting a call? 
14 A If he's close enough. Only if he's close 
15 enough within, you know, a range. On a portable 
16 radio, it is usually a mile tops, not too much 
17 unless you are out in Kansas, straight line, nothing 
18 there, maybe a mile and a half or so. These are 
19 very low power. He would probably hear the mobile 
20 radio more than he would hear the portable radio. 
21 Q So to understand this, when someone in the 
22 vehicle transmits on the mobile, and let's say they 
23 are going to talk to another car, does that 
24 transmission go from their mobile to the transmitter 
25 tower behind the police station and then go back out

1 to that car? 
2 A No, it is just radio to radio, from mobile 
3 radio to mobile radio. 
4 Q And can you do that, can you talk to other 
5 cars when you are on the dispatch channel? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And when other cars are talking to 
8 each other, can you hear that maybe when you are on 
9 the dispatch channel? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
But I'm gathering that you might not hear 
12 it depending on how far apart you are? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And where the radio might be, correct? 
Correct. 
And so, and we heard some testimony from 
17 another officer who talked about like when he left 
18 his police vehicle and went inside a residence for a 
19 call, he might not hear transmissions that are being 
20 made by dispatch because he's a distance from the 
21 car and he's also on the walkie-talkie inside a 
22 building? 
23 A Right. If he's inside the building, the 
24 mobile wouldn't have any factor on his portable 
25 radio. It is that building structure that is going

1 to reduce the capability of receiving on that 
2 portable. 
3 Q Okay. So it is possibility for a police 
4 officer if he's using his walkie-talkie to transmit 
5 a call, but that call might not be received by local 
6 dispatch? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And that has to do with all of those 
9 factors we've talked about? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, are you aware that when the Ferguson 
12 dispatch receives calls or transmits calls that they 
13 actually record those calls? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q So if the call is not, here is a question 
16 I don't even think I asked you this last week. When 
17 a call is not received by a dispatcher, is there 
18 anyway to tell if that call was ever made? 
19 A No, because that recorder is connected to 
20 the receive portion of the dispatch console. So 
21 whatever the dispatch console receives and hears, 
22 that is when it is recorded. 
23 Q Okay. Is it possible, are there occasions 
24 when a call is received like it is garbled or 
25 there's, you know, static that would make it

1 difficult or impossible to tell what's being said? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Definitely. 
Okay. Now, let's talk about when an 
4 officer is wearing his walkie for the portable radio 
5 if his car is on the dispatch channel, we talked 
6 about if he is in his car he can be on two different 
7 channels, right? 
8 A Right. 
9 Q If his car is on the dispatch channel and 
10 his walkie-talkie gets switched to another channel, 
11 does he get any kind of squelch or anything like 
12 that? 
13 A No. 
14 Q So that could happen, and if that were to 
15 happen and he was unaware of the switch, he would 
16 not know?

25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Right. 
What is that orange button?

1 A When the officer presses that, it sends 
2 out a data burst that is a number that has been 
3 programmed in that radio. So it could be 1, 2, 3, 
4 4, it will send out that data burst. It will be 
5 decoded at the dispatch console and whatever they 
6 decode it as, it could be the officer's name, it 
7 could be the car number, it could be anything, an 
8 alias associated to that radio. It could be even to 
9 that beat, it could be beat 104 that when he hits 
10 that button it will come up on the screen. 
11 Lights flash red and a horrible noise 
12 of beeping goes off until that dispatcher hits the 
13 console a couple times to silence it. 
14 Q And so is there any information that is 
15 transmitted other than what you said that might be 
16 preprogramed to associate that radio is the who that 
17 transmitted that. 
18 Is there anything, can I push that 
19 red button and then say something in there? 
20 A Yes, it also lets you to be able to 
21 transmit. 
22 Q And this data burst that can happen if you 
23 press that orange button, does that depend upon 
24 those factors, like how far away you are, whether 
25 you're in a building or there's buildings between

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Those are still factors. 
That's also a radio signal? 
Right. 
And it's 5 watts when it comes from there? 
Yes. 
Okay. When an officer is wearing this 
8 type of radio and this is on his sleeve, if he has 
9 it turned to, for example, the dispatch channel, is 
10 this also a speaker? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
So he can hear what's being transmitted? 
Yes. 
Does this have a speaker on it? 
It does, but it is disabled once that 
16 remote speaker mike is connected to the radio. 
17 Q So if you are in your vehicle and your car 
18 vehicle is turning to the dispatch channel and this 
19 is on the dispatch channel, does either of them 
20 cancel each other out? 
21 A No, it is basically which one is turned up 
22 the loudest is which one they are going to hear.

A Yes, definitely. 
November 3, 2014 
Page 161 
2 
3 Q But it would be if you keyed your mike, 
4 that's when you get that squelch? 
A Correct. 5 
6 Q So let's talk about what calls that might 
7 walk over each other. That is kind of a phrase that 
8 I used, but is it possible if an officer is 
9 transmitting from this type of a radio, a portable 
10 radio, if someone else on that same channel keys in, 
11 can that person talk over him possibly ? 
12 A Especially if it is on a car radio, it's 
13 possible, but it's really whoever is closest to 
14 Ferguson's transmit site on the dispatch channel. 
15 It is called kind of a receiver capture effect. So 
16 that receiver in that base station, whatever hearing 
17 is the strongest is what's going to be able to be 
18 heard to the dispatcher. 
19 However, if they mix then you get the 
20 garbling sound and you might pick out, you know, 102 
21 or you might pick out a little bit of radio traffic. 
22 And that's when the dispatcher will usually say, car 
23 102, go ahead with your traffic or something like 
24 that, or too many cars calling in they usually state 
25 but yes, it can happen.

1 Q Okay. Now let's talk about transmissions 
2 on the RIOT channel. Do those transmissions when 
3 you are on say RIOT A, if you are on RIOT A on your 
4 radio, does that transmission go to Ferguson? 
5 A No, St. Louis County does a series of 
6 voting receivers and all they are receivers and they 
7 are like ears. And the closest radio is picked up, 
8 that audio is sent down by phone line back to 
9 another box here in Clayton called a comparator. 
10 And that takes the best audio, not the transmission, 
11 but the audio sound from that receiver and votes on 
12 which one's the best, and the best audio, the 
13 strongest audio signal will be heard to the recorder 
14 and to the dispatcher sitting at that console 
15 monitoring the RIOT A channel. 
16 Q So the dispatcher monitoring the RIOT A 
17 channel is here in Clayton, right? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So it is not the Ferguson dispatcher who 
20 is monitoring unless she chooses to do that? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And I think we talked about the fact that 
23 a dispatcher has their dispatch channel and then 
24 they have another selected --

2 different channels at once? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And so, so, how many voting? 
Voting receivers. 
How many voting receivers are there in St. 
7 Louis County? 
A Oh, just on the RIOT channel I'm going to 8 
9 take a guess. I don't have their information right 
10 in front of me, but I want to say at least six or 
11 seven. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
14 and west. 
15 Q 
Okay. 
Throughout the county north, south, east 
And so, for example, if something is going 
16 on down in South County, and the county police is 
17 using the RIOT A channel because of this incident 
18 that occurred. If a Ferguson officer calls in on 
19 the RIOT A channel when he's up in Ferguson, is it 
20 possible that his transmission will not be received 
21 by Clayton? 
22 A Yes, especially if the receiver down south 
23 is hearing the transmission louder and it is being 
24 sent in and being voted and voter, that transmission 
25 will be just put on the side basically, won't even

November 3, 2014 
Page 164 
2 Q Will there be any record that that 
3 transmission was made? 
4 A No. 
5 Q So the voting receiver just measures the 
6 strength and quality, audio quality of the call and 
7 then the voting receiver then selects which call 
8 they are going to put through? 
A Right. 9 
10 Q And so is it possible then that somebody 
11 on a walkie-talkie in Ferguson could make a call on 
12 the RIOT A channel, if County Police were using the 
13 RIOT A channel down at South County at the same time 
14 and there were officers talking at the same time, is 
15 it possible then that the Ferguson officer's call 
16 would never get recorded in Clayton? 
17 A Very possible. 
18 Q Is there anything that I haven't asked you 
19 that I forgot about that is important? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
No. 
And just again if you all want to look at 
22 this, I will tell you that this is a radio from the 
23 Ferguson Police Department. It is not Officer 
24 Wilson's radio, but they have the same radios and

9 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Well, it is just kind of 
10 unnerving, I guess, so you are saying, maybe you 
11 didn't say common, but how common is it for dispatch 
12 not to receive calls? 
13 A Urn, it just depends on the radio traffic. 
14 If it is really busy, a really busy day at that 
15 municipality it can happen. You know, one thing, I 
16 hope I'm not telling any secrets, one issue is one 
17 of the county channels which is dispatched in West 
18 County, they have Eureka, they have Chesterfield. 
19 They are so far away that Eureka officer could be 
20 keying up trying to talk to a dispatch and that 
21 Chesterfield officer, which is a little bit closer 
22 to the receiving site, is going to get to Clayton 
23 more and this guy is saying, hey, I need help or

9 emergency? 
10 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Aspect for this? 
Yes. Another way that that works, even if 
13 there's radio traffic, it is still pulsing that data 
14 out. It doesn't care if there's radio traffic on 
15 it, it keeps on trying until it gets an 
16 acknowledgment from the dispatcher. 
17 Q And as I understand, you can be on, I 
18 guess RIOT A, which is the county? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that orange button wouldn't have any, 
21 would it work for county or would it just go to, if 
22 you are on the RIOT A channel. 
23 A Right. 
24 Q And you are a Ferguson officer and if you 
25 hit that a orange button, what would happen?

1 A It would go to dispatch. It is programmed 
2 as a revert, so when you hit that button, if you are 
3 on channel six, it doesn't matter what channel, you 
4 hit that emergency button, it reverts that data to 
5 the dispatch channel.

Q 
To Ferguson's dispatch? 
Yes. 
So even though RIOT A channel, it wouldn't 
consequence to them? 
Right. 
But Ferguson would? 
Right. 
And is it your understanding that most 
14 officers are trained if you are in an emergency 
15 situation to hit that orange button? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Q So if I'm in a shooting or something that 
18 would probably be one of the first things a trained 
19 officer would do is to hit that orange button? 
20 A I can't tell you what that officer would 
21 be thinking at that time, but that is kind of, I 
22 need help, that's what I hit. 
23 Q That's the purpose of that orange button 
24 is to supersede everything to let your dispatch know 
25 that you need help?

3 On that point, 
4 tell us again when you would use that emergency 
5 button, or maybe frequency which is used. I gather 
6 this person on dispatch, would you see that happen 
7 once a week, once a day? 
8 A No, very seldom, and only when it's a life 
9 threatening is my understanding is when they hit 
10 that red button. 
11 Gotcha. And that just 
12 signifies to dispatch that dispatch needs to contact 
13 that officer as soon as possible 
14 
15 
16 
A Or get help to them. 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Does that signal go out to 
17 the other cars? 
18 A What they will hear is just a data burst 
19 of static basically is the best way to put it. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: So, but only the dispatch 
21 would show what radio that was coming from. 
22 
23 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So would it require then a 
24 dispatch to communicate with that radio, like 105, 
25 do you need help, what's going on?

A Right. 1 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Or to put out a call to 
3 other cars, 105 is in an emergency situation and 
4 possibly give a location, right? 
5 A Whatever their standard of their procedure 
6 is, could be both. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Because most departments, I 
8 know you can't speak to all of the departments, it 
9 sounds like you are implying that most departments 
10 have some kind of procedure regarding how to use 
11 that orange emergency button? 
A Correct. 12 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: It is put there for a 
14 reason, right? 
15 A Yes. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: And the reason is for 
17 emergency situations? 
18 A Yes. 
19 So the channel, 
20 the radio channel has nothing to do with the orange 
21 button, it doesn't have to be on a certain channel? 
22 A That's correct. That radio when I 
23 programmed it, it is called revert and it reverts to 
24 the dispatch channel. 
25 Is it common

1 for police officers to keep their mobile and their 
2 portable on a different channel? 
3 A Usually, it is. 
4 Usually they do. Okay. 
5 So they would have to know that they are on a 
6 different, their portable is on a different channel 
7 when they get out of the car and switch it back? 
8 A Some might just use it to listen to the 
9 neighboring municipal next to them, that is what 
10 they use it mainly, what they tell me. They like to 
11 hear what's going on around them. Maybe Ballwin 
12 would listen in on Manchester PD is doing in case 
13 they need an assistance or something. 
14 They do keep it on 
15 different channels while they are in the car? 
16 A Yeah. And some keep it turned off too to 
17 save the battery and save avoidance of feedback 
18 sometimes. 
19 Can the 
20 dispatcher ever notify a police officer that they 
21 are on the wrong channel? Like they think they are 
22 on their department channel, but for some reason 
23 they are always on it or have a signal? 
24 A No, there is nothing the dispatcher can 
25 see on what channel that that portable or mobile is

1 on. The only way if they are calling them, they 
2 know that they're not on the dispatch channel. If 
3 they are trying to call dispatch and they're not 
4 responding, yes. They will call them by cell phone 
5 or keep on calling, but there is no way that 
6 dispatcher knows. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: I had a question 
8 So there is no readings 
9 that goes out daily from all whatever happened that 
10 day? Like there is a computer generating all the 
11 radios from that day for each department, police 
12 department in the areas, different areas. There is 
13 no generated report that's coming out? 
14 A No, not from which channel their on. The 
15 only thing I've seen where it counts how many times 
16 the radio has been keyed up. It might say it's been 
17 keyed up on this channel ten times that day, that's 
18 about it. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: On the mobile, I'm sorry, 
20 that's passed around, I'm sorry, the portable, thank 
21 you. The orange button is on there, is there also a 
22 an orange button on the mobile that's inside the 
23 car?

A Yes.

Page 172

3 MS. WHIRLEY: Because I was going to ask 
4 you, what can an officer do if he's in trouble if he 
5 may not be heard on the transmitter, but that's what 
6 he can do? 
7 A Right. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
9 Is there any 
10 other way for dispatch to communicate with the 
11 officer, like through texting to display or texting 
12 to the laptop. 
13 A There is some messaging on their CAD 
14 system, their in-car computer system. I know that 
15 exist, I can't tell you that Ferguson has that 
16 feature, but most of the agencies within St. Louis 
17 County does have a way, and they can communicate car 
18 to car also, so that officer can send a message to 
19 the neighboring precinct or jurisdiction, how am I 
20 going to say this, to the officer next to them. 
21 Would be the officers within that agency. 
22 You talked about 
23 red button emergency situation, that's a pretty 
24 broad for a police officer to cover, obviously, 
25 every emergency situation is going to require a red

1 button. You kind of mentioned a life and death 
2 situation, seems like that button is pretty much 
3 reserved for an extremely serious emergency, not 
4 typical emergency for a police officer? 
A Correct. 5 
6 And that can happen very 
7 quickly. The odds of a police officer to get to 
8 that button in the time of a quickly escalating 
9 activity, that could be a question? 
10 A Right. 
11 It would be hard to hit 
12 that button in a very highly emergency situation 
13 that happens very quickly? 
14 A Right. And if you notice the size of that 
15 button, you really got to hunt for it sometimes. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: And just on another note, 
17 for example, the situation is over, then there would 
18 be no reason necessarily for the officer to use the 
19 orange button as opposed to using his walkie-talkie 
20 because then he can explain the nature of his need 
21 for help, correct? 
22 A Correct. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: And if he's transmitting, 
24 if you're transmitting from your walkie-talkie and 
25 it's not being received, other than nobody responds,

1 is there any way that the officer knows that his 
2 transmission didn't get received? 
3 A None whatsoever. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: I send an email and it 
5 doesn't get received, I get something back saying it 
6 wasn't delivered? 
7 A Correct. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: But there's nothing on the 
9 radio like that. 
10 A No. Some departments train they officers 
11 if they don't get out, take radio out of their 
12 holster and transmit, but I couldn't tell you about, 
13 but that is part of a SOP in a lot of departments. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And SOP is standard 
15 operating procedure?

18 CAD stands for, the CAD?
