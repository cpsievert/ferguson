1 Q So the vehicle was on the west end of the 
2 crime scene, Michael Brown's body was on the east 
3 end of the crime scene? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q So when you began your initial 
6 walk-through, you started where the body was?

10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Are you videotaping at this point? 
No, ma'am. 
When you are doing the walk-through then, 
11 did you notice that there were already items of 
12 apparent evidence or things of interest that had 
13 already been marked? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. There are a lot of times 
15 classes that are offered at their own police 
16 academy, basically road officers responding to 
17 homicide scenes. 
18 It is not only training, a lot of 
19 times kind of fall backs on common sense. If there 
20 is something, be it a shell casing or piece of 
21 clothing that you know is part of evidence or 
22 evidentiary value, most anyone will typically mark 
23 that, be it with a piece of crime scene tape or 
24 traffic cones, they will set stuff near items just 
25 so one, it is marked and they know where it is at.

1 Two, so someone doesn't accidently step on it or 
2 kick it or move it. 
3 Q So did you notice that there were a number 
4 of traffic cones that were already in this scene? 
5 A Yes, as part of the walk-through they 
6 would say that cone over there is marking what we 
7 think is a projectile or that traffic cone is 
8 marking a shell casing and they would just point 
9 things out to me as we were walking through. 
10 Q All right. And so after you did this 
11 walk-through, did you walk the length of the crime 
12 scene going then west and then returning east to 
13 where the deceased was? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And also, just for the record, the street 
16 of Canfield at this point, are there sidewalks on 
17 either side of the street? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And there are apartment buildings, this is 
20 a complex that has a number of apartment buildings, 
21 correct?

24 lots?

1 Q And there is entrances to the parking 
2 lots, there are streets that are coming off of 
3 Canfield, correct? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 
6 
Q So after you did your walk-through, what's 
the next thing you did? 
7 A Urn, typically at that point we would go 
8 back, my van was parked on the west end of the crime 
9 scene just west of where Darren Wilson's vehicle was 
10 at. We would go back there, I would prepare my 
11 video camera, you know, get a new memory card put 
12 in, write some notes down and at that point 
13 typically start my video walk-through of the scene. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Is that what you did in this case? 
No, ma'am. 
Why not? 
As far as the exact times, I couldn't tell 
18 you, but during this time when we were heading back 
19 to my car, another round of gunshots were fired and 
20 extremely close proximity to the crime scene. There 
21 was obviously a large crowd reacting to that as well 
22 as a police reaction to it. 
23 And the decision was made almost 
24 immediately to kind of hold, make sure that our 
25 crime scene is secured. I have to be able to

1 concentrate what I'm looking at and trying to 
2 collect, versus trying to watch the crowd behind me 
3 that's growing ever bigger and more angry by the 
4 minute. 
5 Q And so there was a break in your 
6 investigation until you were comfortable that the 
7 crime scene was secured; is that right? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Is anyone else processing the crime scene 
10 or do anything else or touching in the crime scene 
11 while you take that break? 
12 A No, ma'am. All the manpower there was 
13 utilized to try to secure the crime, just secure the 
14 perimeter of the crime scene. We had officers 
15 10 feet apart, 5 feet apart every inch of the crime 
16 scene tape trying to keep people out of it. 
17 Q These were county officers, were there 
18 Ferguson officers? 
19 A County officers, Ferguson officers, I 
20 guarantee you there were other neighboring 
21 municipality officers that were there. 
22 Q Approximately if you had to guess, how 
23 many police officers were on the scene?

Had you ever had a scene like this before? 
Never.

6 you begin your video walk-through?

Q 
I did. 
And so are you the one who operates the 
Yes, ma'am. 
And do you shoot the video continuously 
12 during your walk-through or do you stop it at 
13 certain points? 
14 A Once I start the actual scene video, I do 
15 continue one continuous video. 
16 
17 
18 
Q 
A 
Q 
Did you do that in this case? 
Yes, ma'am.

1 Q Any other officers that are narrating 
2 what's going on? 
3 A No, ma'am. 
4 Q And so after you did this video 
5 walk-through, again, where did you start the video 
6 walk-through? 
7 A I believe if you want to look at the 
8 picture of the crime scene as a rectangle, I started 
9 at the southwest corner, moved east to northeast to 
10 northwest in a counter clockwise motion. 
11 Q Okay. I'm going to hand you what we have 
12 marked, and I want to make something clear on the 
13 record, I believe the last time we met there was one 
14 item that was marked as an evidentiary item, it was 
15 a report for that witness. Just because to make it 
16 clear, that was, I think, marked State's Exhibit 1, 
17 which is typically what we do in cases. But because 
18 this is a grand jury exhibit, we're going to use 
19 different, call it something different. 
20 So we will at some point re-mark that 
21 report, which was State's Exhibit 1 and that will be 
22 Grand Jury Exhibit 1. Okay, it is State's Exhibit, 
23 it has the typical red sticker that has State's 
24 Exhibit, but it will say GJ 1. We are going to mark 
25 all of ours GJ and then a sequential number.

9 A It is. 
10 Q And that's the top page, correct?

3 delete a photograph like if you take it and you look 
4 at it and you see that's blurry or doesn't show what 
5 you wanted it to show?

I'm going to turn it around because it is 
4 upside down. Does this printing print out on each 
5 photograph as it comes out of the printer at the 
6 lab? 
7 A It does. 
8 Q So it says on there SLCPD, that's St. 
9 Louis County Police Department, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then it says DCS, and then there's a 
12 four digit number?

A 
Q 
Correct. 
And on this photograph it says 0001? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And the one is circled, did you circle 
I did. 
And then it says dot JPG? 
Yes. 
And then it says 0001 again; is that 
Yes. 
So the printing that appears on the back 
25 of each photo, does it sequentially number these as

1 0001 and then the next one in order would be 0002 
2 and so forth? 
3 A As far as the DSC number, that's the 
4 number of the photograph on the file card. So this 
5 picture is number one, the next picture would be 
6 number two. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A The second number that you see 0001, those 
9 are not always going to be in sequential order for 
10 this stack. Different things number, this one 
11 printed up three separate copies. So while this 
12 picture will always be number one, the next picture 
13 may have number four or number eight, whatever 
14 number that photo was print off. 
15 If they printed up four photos of 
16 that one, it would also be DSC1, the second set of 
17 numbers could be 001 through 4, depending on which 
18 number it was in the stack. 
19 Q Okay. So the number that you circled, 
20 which is the first number, that's what we are 
21 talking about, this is your first photo? 
22 A Yes, ma'am. There are several ways to 
23 stamp the back of these. Some officers just use the 
24 official photograph stamp and would just circle that 
25 number as the image number.

1 Q So when you went through each of these 
2 photographs, did you check to make sure you had each 
3 of the 161 photos in sequential order?

And the first and last photographs. 
Okay. So I'm going to put up here, I'm

1 photos, do you feel that these photos accurately 
2 depicted the scene as you saw it that day? 
3 A For the most part, yes, ma'am. 
4 Q Okay. I want to make sure I get the whole 
5 photo. There we go. 
6 And so in Image Number 2, can you 
7 describe what is depicted there? And you can use

Q 
A 
Okay. 
I'm going to get out of the way. 
This would be the first photo that we took 
12 after the initial walk-through and the walk-through 
13 with the video. Some of the things that this video 
14 shows overall number one, here is where my crime 
15 scene van is parked. The traffic cones that you see 
16 are things that were set in place prior to my 
17 arrival. 
18 Different pieces of evidence, 
19 Ferguson officers or anyone else officer wise that 
20 were there that knew part of the story of the scene 
21 would denote that, you know, just kind of make sure 
22 hey, this is where this is at or make sure no one 
23 steps on it or moves it.

1 Q I know some of you on the end may not be 
2 able to see the entire image because of the way that 
3 screen is recessed into the wall. So first of all, 
4 these photos will all be available to you to handle 
5 and look at at any time you want to see them, but if 
6 you feel that you can't see, you want to move your 
7 chair around here and again, if you are asking 
8 questions, just state your juror number, it doesn't 
9 matter if you are in order, just as long as you 
10 state your juror number.

12 
A So this perspective where I'm standing is 
also where I started the video walk-through. It is 
13 the southwest corner of the scene. 
14 You can see this is Officer Wilson's 
15 car, down here you can see another Ferguson vehicle 
16 and another Ferguson vehicle down at the eastern 
17 end. Those are cars that were there when I showed 
18 up to start my investigation. So again, when I show 
19 up, I try not to move anything because I photograph 
20 how I come into a scene. 
21 Those vehicles were not there at the 
22 time of the incident, they were placed there by 
23 Ferguson officers to help secure a crime scene and 
24 to block views of Michael Brown's body. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
So Michael Brown's body is in between

1 those two Ferguson police cars and those are SUVs, 
2 correct? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. And you can see the corner of 
4 an orange body screen between the two cars, that is 
5 something that I set up after my arrival to assist 
6 in blocking views. 
7 Q Why do you do that? 
8 A A number of reasons one, privacy. Two, 
9 seeing a dead body in the middle of the street is 
10 often disturbing to a lot of people. It is out of 
11 respect for the victim, out of respect for the 
12 family, out of respect for everyone to just kind of 
13 take away a visual sign of stress more than 
14 anything. 
15 Q You learned at some point that family 
16 members of Michael Brown had arrived at the scene, 
17 correct? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
20 scene? 
21 A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Were they allowed to enter the crime 
Initially, no. I think towards the end, 
22 not towards the end, but when the medical examiner 
23 had arrived and were getting ready to move the body, 
24 I believe Michael Brown's father, I think, but a 
25 family member was allowed to step inside while we,

1 the crime scene, while we removed his body as part 
2 of the investigation. 
3 Q So keeping anyone out, including family 
4 members, that's all because you want this crime 
5 scene to be as pristine and undisturbed as possible, 
6 correct? 
7 A That's our goal, yes. 
8 Q And so at this point, about how long into 
9 you being on the scene are we now? 
10 A If I arrived 1:15 or so, probably find the 
11 time stamp on this photo, it is no less than an hour 
12 after I arrived just because in between this photo 
13 being taken and my arrival was when the gunshots
