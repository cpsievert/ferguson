20 mind?

1 were a police officer and he's still moving toward

3 didn't think he was a threat? If I were being shot 
4 and I were being shot at, even though I had my hands 
5 up, I'd get on the ground. 
6 Couldn't it be possible, why didn't he 
7 stop moving? I mean, it would seem to me that there 
8 could still be perceived as a threat if he's still 
9 moving toward the police officer and the police 
10 officer is backing up. Look at it from another 
11 point, I just want you to tell me if it's possible? 
12 A It may be possible in your world. 
13 In my world? 
14 A Yeah. 
15 Okay. What does that 
16 mean? 
17 A That means that you more than likely not 
18 to be shot the way he was shot. So he did not know, 
19 being as young as he is, not knowing the seriousness 
20 the situation. After getting pierced with the gun,

2 A Immediately, but he did not know, 
3 apparently, he did not know to get down on the
