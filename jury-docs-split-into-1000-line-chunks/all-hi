A 
Q 
Sure. (Witness marking on the exhibit.) 
All right. 
I've got a question. Those 
10 trees we see on the left side of the road, are they 
11 cut up six, seven foot off the ground if you are 
12 standing under there you can see through them? 
13 A You can walk under these trees without any 
14 problem. 
15 It is hard to tell from this 
16 photo. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So Image 1G, and we are 
19 going to conclude as soon as we get done with the 
20 first round of photos of the police car if that's 
21 okay. So, again, from the police vehicle now the 
22 photographer has turned a little more clockwise, 
23 what building did you see in that shot? 
24 A Far left-hand side you can see a portion 
25 of Building 4 and then it moves onto the side and

3 what was this one, F and G, can you see where 
4 would have been? 
A Yes. 5

Q

And then in 1G we see 
11 building, correct? 
12 A Correct. 
's 
13 Q And she said she was inside, but then I 
14 can't remember if she says she came outside, but 
15 from her building, if she were looking out a window, 
16 she could see the police car, correct? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 
19 
Q And on 101, Grand Jury Exhibit 101, you 
have 1A and 1B, that's because was walking

1 Q And so from that location, what buildings 
2 do we see? 
3 A We again see Building 5 on the left-hand 
4 side. And further down in the background you can 
5 see a portion of Building 9. And then if we move 
6 over to the right-hand side of the street, you can 
7 see Building 17, a portion of Building 17 and a 
8 portion of building 16 and a small portion of 15. 
9 Q Okay. So based upon the images that we've 
10 seen so far, would somebody in Building 6, for 
11 example, be able to see the police car? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
Building 6? 
No. 
Okay. How about a person who was in

22 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q

1 Building 4. A majority of Building 4 and whatever 
2 photograph this is, 1G is visible, so yes. 
3 Q Okay. And Image 1I. And again, from the 
4 police vehicle, what buildings and what can we see? 
5 A We're again looking at starting from left 
6 to right. We're looking at a portion of Building 
7 15, a portion of Building 16, Building 17, and then 
8 in the far right-hand side is Building 18. 
9 Q So in Image 1J, again, this is turning a 
10 little more clockwise. What building do we see in 
11 1J? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
We're primarily looking at Building 18. 
Okay. An in Building 18 we talk about 
14 that being where was? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And then Number 30, this would be where 
17 says she was standing smoking a 
18 cigarette with somebody in a green shirt or black 
19 shirt? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Photograph 1K. We can see this is also a 
22 portion of Building 2964, which is 18, correct? 
23 A That's correct. 
24 Q And we can see the mailboxes in this 
25 photograph where said she was

3 Q And even more so in lL. See the mailboxes 
4 in that photograph? 
5 Q And this is the last one and then we'll 
6 break. This is 1M, which again takes you full 
7 circle or almost full circle. And here you can see 
8 where said he was working. 
9 
10 
11 
Is that 
A 
Q 
12 okay. 
13 
right here? 
Yes, ma'am, yes. 
So that's something around full circle, 
MS. ALIZADEH: We'll conclude for today. 
14 What I would propose doing is that before next 
15 Friday, I'll mount all of these on a similar board 
16 and you understand the progression of the 
17 photographs. I don't know that it is necessary that 
18 we say what is seen. I think combined with using 
19 the board there, the legend and these photographs, 
20 but I will also ask Detective to return on 
21 Friday to finish. I maybe just have a wrap-up to do 
22 with him. Sheila will have some questions and then 
23 you --
24 MS. WHIRLEY: I just have one concluding 
25 question and that's it. Because I wasn't real clear

1 on something you said, I just wanted to make sure 
2 I'm clear. Would it be correct to say that you're 
3 not here today making a decision about probable 
4 cause or telling the grand jury there's no probable 
5 cause to charge Darren Wilson? 
6 A No, I am not, absolutely not. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: That would be a 
8 misstatement?

I am not here making that statement.

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXIV 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morn1ng. It lS 
3 Friday, November 21st, it is 9:24 a.m. This is 
4 Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is present, all 12 
5 grand jurors are present, as 1s the court reporter. 
6 And we've spent about an hour kind of 
7 talking about some procedural issues and matters and 
8 concerns that the grand jurors had. 
9 We did not discuss any of the evidence or 
10 testimony so that discussion was had not on the 
11 record. 
12 I do want to tell you that as, s1nce you 
13 last met, which was on Thursday, last week, I've 
14 taken this week to go through every transcript that 
15 has been produced, which we are up-to-date. We have 
16 the transcript from last Thursday and what I've done 
17 is I made a chart and I made a chart that had the 
18 name of every witness who testified and whether or 
19 not that witness made statements prior to their 
20 testimony. 
21 As you know, it was originally our plan 
22 that we would put on witness statements prior to the 
23 witness testifying. We play statements, we provide 
24 transcripts when we had them, but over the weeks 
25 because of scheduling issues and problems getting 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 5 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 witnesses in, we kind of got away from that. We'll 
2 put the witness on now and we'll listen to their 
3 statements later. 
4 I wanted to make sure that I had put 
5 everything on and, of course, I discovered that I'm 
6 not perfect and we have not, so I want to make this 
7 representation to y'all. 
8 And, aga1n, names of witnesses will be 
9 redacted from the transcripts, so I'm just going to 
10 go ahead and say their names. But if you will 
11 recall, there was a witness testified, her name 1s 
12 She is the 
13 and she did testify and I did play a statement of 
14 hers that was taken on the date of the shooting by 
15 the St. Louis County Police Department and that 
16 statement was three minutes long. 
17 Apparently there is another statement of 
18 hers that was given to the FBI on September 2nd and 
19 that statement is 11 minutes and 58 seconds. I did 
20 not play that, but I have it hear, all right. 
21 So I'm going to go through each of these 
22 and then we will discuss whether or not you want us 
23 to play or give you just the transcripts of what 
24 have you. 
25 There was another witness or another young 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 6 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 man who did not testify, but you'll recall 
2 he originally made a statement 
3 to St. Louis County Police on the day of the 
4 shooting. It was a ten-minute recorded statement 
5 that we played for you where he described having 
6 witnessed the incident. 
7 testified last week about a 
8 phone call and we played a phone call for you from 
9 that witness where he said, no, he really didn't see 
10 it, he just said he saw it. So there is another 
11 statement of that was given to the 
12 joint investigators, so United States attorney, 
13 Justice Department attorney and FBI people, that was 
14 given on September 26th. It's 15 minutes and 58 
15 seconds long, and I did not play that one for you. 
16 I have listened to it and actually that's how I knew 
17 was recanting the story. The essence 
18 of that statement he says, I didn't really see it. 
19 
20 here. 
But that statement is also, I have it in 
So we can play that for you if you want to 
21 hear that one. 
22 There was a woman testified named 
23 , she's the one who, I believe, was taking 
24 her trash out when she heard the shots. She made 
25 two statements, one on August 9th on the date of the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 7 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 shooting and one on August 16th to the FBI. During 
2 their canvas, remember the week after they did a 
3 knock on door canvas? 
4 I have given you those two transcripts 
5 already, and at the time you all said you didn't 
6 need to hear the statement, the statement played 
7 because you have the transcripts. 
8 But again, I have those statements here 
9 and if you desire to hear them, we can play them. 
10 Then there's , you will 
11 remember she's the woman from who was 
12 taking a drive into Canfield Apartment Complex and 
13 testified that she witnessed the shooting. I've 
14 already played for you a statement that she made to 
15 the joint investigators, the U.S. attorney, 
16 Department of Justice attorney and FBI agents. That 
17 statement was on October 22nd. It was an hour and 
18 38 minutes long and there was no transcript of the 
19 statement at that time, but the court reporter took 
20 down the statement as we played it, and so you've 
21 heard that statement. 
22 There is another statement that was made 
23 previously by her on September 11th to the St. Louis 
24 County Police Department, that statement is 44 
25 minutes and 52 seconds long. I don't have a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 8 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 transcript of that statement, but I have that audio 
2 if you want to hear that as well. 
3 There was witness if you 
4 recall, he was kind of like, he said he was kind of 
5 like the godson to He was on his 
6 balcony trying to make a cell phone call because he 
7 gets better reception out on his balcony. 
8 He made a statement that I played for you 
9 on September 30th. It was a statement made to joint 
10 investigators. It was 33 minutes and 14 seconds 
11 long. And you've already heard that one and have a 
12 transcript of that. 
13 He also made a statement on the day of the 
14 FBI's canvas on August 16th and that statement is 22 
15 minutes and 31 seconds. And I have that statement, 
16 but I have not played it for you, nor do I have a 
17 transcript. 
18 I don't know if you recall 
19 , she's the witness who says she likes 
20 her gospel mus1c and she was rocking to the gospel 
21 mus1c 1n her car when she pulled into the complex 
22 that day and witnessed the shooting from behind, 
23 from inside her vehicle. 
24 She made a statement to joint 
25 investigators that statement was made on 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 9 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 August 15th, 2014. 
2 At the time I asked you if you wanted to 
3 hear y'all told me you didn't think you wanted to, 
4 but I have the transcripts already prepared at that 
5 time because I was thinking we would play it. So at 
6 this time I'll pass out the transcripts for her 
7 statement and y'all can have those and if you want 
8 to hear her statement, we can play that one as well. 
9 Then there was , he's the 
10 gentleman who was making internet kind of video 
11 phone call to a female friend and he unwittingly 
12 recorded the sounds of gunshots, and I didn't play 
13 his statement. His statement was given to the FBI 
14 on August 18th, it is ten minutes and 41 seconds 
15 long. I don't have a transcript, but I do have that 
16 statement if you want to listen to it. 
17 There 1s , he's the 
18 witness who had called into that POD cast show, that 
19 and had made statements that 
20 seem to indicate that he had seen the shooting. And 
21 he came in and testified to you about what he saw. 
22 He made a statement to St. Louis County 
23 Police and the FBI actually on the day that he 
24 testified in the grand jury because he would not 
25 make a statement to the police he actually was 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 10 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 subpoenaed to come into grand jury to testify. 
2 So when he arrived at our office, FBI 
3 
4 
agent and then sat down with him and 
took his statement and that's recorded. I don't 
5 have a transcript, but I do have the statement, that 
6 statement is 53 minutes and three seconds, so if you 
7 want to hear that one you can. 
8 , she was the physician 
9 assistant who treated Officer Wilson on the day of 
10 the shooting. 
11 She made a statement to joint 
12 investigators on August 27th of 2014. Her statement 
13 was recorded and is 16 minutes and 29 seconds long. 
14 I don't have a transcript, but I have a statement if 
15 you want to hear that. 
16 made a statement to joint 
17 investigators on the 9th before he testified 1n this 
18 grand jury. So that would have been on 
19 November 12th and his statement is two hours and 40 
20 minutes long if you would like to hear that. 
21 Actually, I do have a transcript, they delivered the 
22 
23 
transcript to me as well. 
and that statement. 
So I have a transcript 
24 I didn't print out the transcript because 
25 obviously it is quite voluminous. If you need it, I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 11 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 will certainly print out cop1es for everyone. 
2 And then finally , she was 
3 the woman who was in the vehicle with her mom and 
4 dad and sister and her daughter, she made two 
5 statements. Neither of which have been played to 
6 you. One was on August 21st to the St. Louis County 
7 Police, that's 19 minutes and 15 seconds long. And 
8 the other one was to joint investigators and that 
9 was made, I think, the day before she came in and 
10 testified here, that would be November 12th. And 
11 that statement is 35 minutes and 45 seconds long. 
12 And maybe at a morn1ng break, I'm go1ng to 
13 g1ve this chart to the foreperson. I've highlighted 
14 the ones missing statements so you guys can talk 
15 amongst yourselves if there 1s any need to hear 
16 those statements or get transcripts for those 
17 statements, we can do that before you deliberate. 
18 GRAND JUROR: Whatever happened to the 
19 
20 
witness somebody who didn't want to come? 
MS. ALIZADEH: we never were 
21 able to get him subpoenaed. He's hung up on me 
22 twice, he hung up on the Department of Justice 
23 attorney twice, they've not been able to get him 1n 
24 for an interview. 
25 I've had an investigator to his home, to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 12 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 his mother's home, and either people don't answer 
2 the door or when they answer the door they say 
3 isn't here. 
4 Police are not authorized to go into a 
5 house and look for somebody unless they have a 
6 search warrant. And given that he's not, he hasn't 
7 committed a crime, we really can't get a search 
8 warrant to go into a house to find him. 
9 So, you know, I did play his statement for 
10 you to take into consideration the fact that he 1s 
11 unwilling to come in and give live testimony to you. 
12 When you consider how many witnesses have 
13 g1ven different statements after they come in and 
14 testify, just keep that in mind, that you were able 
15 to question him and observe him and judge his 
16 credibility live, okay. 
17 GRAND JUROR: I have one more question. 
18 What would be the reason that a police department or 
19 the FBI or the civil rights will get a statement at 
20 the 9th hour before the witness comes in to testify? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: Well, that would be a 
22 question that you would have to ask them. You know, 
23 as you know, they're running their own 
24 investigation, independent investigation and as you 
25 probably, you might be able to tell even by looking, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 13 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 I didn't g1ve you the whole list. I left out a 
2 page. 
3 A lot of these witnesses who were spoken 
4 to were spoken to by either county police officers 
5 on the day of the shooting or the day after the 
6 shooting and then sometimes on that following 
7 weekend when the FBI did their canvas they were 
8 spoken to. 
9 Some of these interviews are as short as 
10 three minutes. As an example, I'll use 
11 She was interviewed by a county detective 
12 on the date of the shooting. I think her interview 
13 was something like three minutes. Not very 
14 detailed. Not very, you know, there isn't even 
15 anything in her statement at that time as to what 
16 car she was driving. 
17 
18 
19 
As you know, that kind of became an 1ssue. 
She testified she had the and that 
kind of is an 1ssue. I'm only speculating as to the 
20 reason that they were conducting their own 
21 interviews. I think that definitely witnesses 
22 needed more 1n depth interviews and they determined 
23 they were going to do those, but I can't really tell 
24 you, it would be speculating on my part if they had 
25 any other kind of motive or desire, but they are 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 14 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 running their own investigation. They will, they 
2 are prepar1ng a report with recommendations of their 
3 own so they feel a need to actually talk to every 
4 witness themselves. 
5 Okay. Also we did not have it at the 
6 time, but actually emailed a copy of his 
7 CV after he testified, so I marked that as Exhibit 
8 103. 
9 (Deposition Exhibit Number 103 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And at this time we'll 
12 proceed with who I anticipate may be the last 
13 witness and that's who started 
14 last Thursday. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I have one quick question. 
16 referenced his report, do we not 
17 anticipate getting one from his autopsy? 
18 
19 
20 done. 
21 
22 
MS. WHIRLEY: We don't have one currently. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't even know if it's 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You know, honestly, during 
23 the break we can try to contact him if it 1s done, 
24 he maybe can email it to us, and if it 1s not done. 
25 GRAND JUROR: I asked about 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 15 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 report. He mentioned finishing up his report and we 
2 never saw anything. If that 1s of interest of 
3 people to inquire into it or not? 
4 GRAND JUROR: What do you mean he didn't 
5 saw everything? 
6 GRAND JUROR: He never submitted his 
7 report from his autopsy. He referenced he looked at 
8 some pictures when. 
9 GRAND JUROR: He should have written his 
10 report by now. 
11 GRAND JUROR: This lS it, he didn't submit 
12 his autopsy report. 
13 
14 
MS. WHIRLEY: We'll contact and see. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It is worth us reaching out 
15 if he's got it and can email to us we'll get it. If 
16 he doesn't, you know, the only thing would be y'all 
17 would have to discuss if you want to hold up your 
18 deliberations until you get it. This is, aga1n, 
19 your investigation and if there 1s something you 
20 think you need, we're going to get it for you. 
21 
22 
MS. WHIRLEY: Another question? 
GRAND JUROR: We need to decide even if we 
23 need to ask for it. 
24 GRAND JUROR: I thought the only reason 
25 that we would have it is because he was, he had a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 16 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 difference of opinion as to one of the wounds as 
2 opposed to the medical examiner for St. Louis 
3 County, 1s that my understanding? Was that my 
4 understanding? 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: That's something you need to 
6 figure out. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
MS. ALIZADEH: We can't --
GRAND JUROR: I'm sorry? 
MS. ALIZADEH: We've got email. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I can reach out to him. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: We can make quick inquiry. 
12 If he's got it, we'll get. If he doesn't have it, 
13 you guys are going to have to decide if you want to 
14 hold up deliberations until you get it. It 1s easy. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I'm not sure that everything 
16 that we've done so far 1s thorough if we would make 
17 a decision before we have his report that that would 
18 
19 
not reflect good on us, you know what I mean? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Let me tell you this. In 
20 any actual criminal trial, the report of the medical 
21 examiner, the police reports, any reports that you 
22 all have been g1ven 1n your investigation, none of 
23 those or admissible 1n a trial because the report 
24 itself is considered hearsay. 
25 The testimony is the evidence in the case. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 17 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 So has now, typically we have a report 
2 before the witness testifies and we may use that 
3 report to prepare us for their testimony, and then 
4 we may use that report if they testify differently 
5 than what the report says certainly, but in this 
6 case, we didn't have that report in advance. 
7 If we had it and it was a trial, we 
8 couldn't let the jury see it anyway, but that's 
9 something, again, you guys are go1ng to have to talk 
10 about. During this break, we'll go and do, we'll 
11 contact somebody right now. If we get it great, if 
12 we don't get it, you are going to have to decide if 
13 you want to wait for the report, okay. And that 
14 will be the decision you all can make amongst 
15 yourselves during the break or lunch or what have 
16 you. Okay. 
17 Anything else before we take a bathroom 
18 break or stretch your legs? 
19 (Recess) 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley. 
21 There was a request regarding autopsy 
22 report. Fortunately I was able to reach him by 
23 telephone during our break. He said that he was 
24 waiting on some information and hadn't completed the 
25 report, but he could have it ready by Monday. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 18 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 So he wanted me to get back to him and 
2 he'll work on it over the weekend. He wanted me to 
3 get back to him and let him know if that would be 
4 okay, should he work on it or what. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Why don't you guys talk 
6 about it during your lunch break. We'll let him 
7 know after lunch whether he needs to chop-chop, get 
8 that done for you guys, okay. 
9 So at this time, we're go1ng to recall 
10 Detective 
11 DETECTIVE 
12 having previously been sworn, retakes the stand for 
13 further questioning. 
14 EXAMINATION

Q 
A 
Q 
Good morn1ng, Detective 
Good morn1ng. 
This will be your third time appear1ng on 
19 this matter in the grand Jury and I will just remind 
20 you, you are still under oath to tell the truth and 
21 also that you are under oath not to divulge or 
22 disclose anything that happens in the grand Jury or 
23 to even discuss that you were appearing at the grand 
24 Jury or any matters or for the fact that they have 
25 this matter under consideration.

A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So, I first want to clear something up, 
3 and this actually came about at the conclusion of 
4 your day on Thursday, and we were not done with your 
5 testimony, but there was a question asked by Sheila 
6 Whirley and I wanted to clarify something. 
7 Last Thursday I had asked you 
8 questions about your investigation, about your 
9 questioning of Officer Wilson, your reasons for not 
10 placing him under arrest after you had interviewed 
11 him, the reason you did not place him under arrest 
12 sometime subsequent to that and I asked you if you 
13 felt that you had probable cause after you had 
14 interviewed him, if you felt that at that time that 
15 you had probable cause to arrest him, and your 
16 answer I believe was no. 
17 At that time you did not feel that 
18 you did and I want to clarify for the grand JUrors 
19 and Sheila brought up the fact, you are not say1ng, 
20 are you, Detective, that you do not feel that 
21 there's probable cause to indict Officer Wilson of 
22 any offense in this case? 
23 A Correct, I'm not g1v1ng that op1n1on. 
24 Q In fact, in preparation for your 
25 testimony, did we discuss whether or not any 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 20 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 questions about your op1n1on would be answered by 
2 you? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
We did discuss that, yes. 
And I told you that I would not want you 
5 to g1ve your own op1n1on if you have one, nor would 
6 I want any of the grand jurors to ask you your 
7 opinion because that is actually their decision and 
8 not yours? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct, yes. 
So just to clarify for everybody, your 
11 answer about not arresting Officer Wilson after he 
12 was interviewed, which was less than 24 hours after 
13 the actual shooting incident was not a comment on 
14 your part as to whether you feel that there's 
15 probable cause to indict, is that fair to say? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
And you all understand that at no time do 
18 I think would it be appropriate for you to ask his 
19 op1n1on as to whether there is probable cause to 
20 indict. 
21 Also, you may recall that during 
22 testimony of certain witnesses they may have been 
23 asked questions about their opinion as to whether 
24 there was excess1ve force used and in those cases, 
25 those witnesses, if you recall, were all actual 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 21 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 eyewitnesses to the incident. And so whether they 
2 have an opinion or not I think might be relevant, 
3 but given that Detective is not witness to 
4 the incident, I don't feel it is appropriate for you 
5 to ask him his opinion as to any of the issues in 
6 this case. 
7 He's here to testify about the 
8 investigation and the facts that he's discovered and 
9 I leave it to you to determine the issues of law 1n 
10 this case. 
11 Also, Detective after your 
12 testimony you indicated to me that I had asked you a 
13 question about whether or not the investigation you 
14 conducted in this case was any different than any 
15 other investigation you've done regarding use of 
16 force investigations, and I believe you testified 
17 Thursday that no, you have not done anything 
18 differently or something to that effect. And you 
19 told me that you wanted to clarify that; is that
