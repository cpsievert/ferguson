18 will say a minute or two. A minute or two is kind 
19 of long.

22 Michael Brown was behind that car holding on for a

6 hands up, I made a mistake, have thrown my hand back 
7 like this, and police have pulled guns on me, you 
8 know what I'm saying? 
9 He said well, hey, keep your hands on 
10 the wheel at all times. But you know, like I said, 
11 you've some police officers are not that bad, but I 
12 have ran into some nasty police officers, you know 
13 what I'm saying? But I still don't get nasty with 
14 them, but that's my attitude. 
15 You take these young people coming up 
16 today, you know, they're not going to take it like I 
17 took it, you know what I'm saying? 
18 See where I come from, I mean, I 
19 couldn't even walk on the sidewalk when the police 
20 come. I had to get off the sidewalk, you know what 
21 I'm saying? 
22 Without being asked? 
23 A Right, right, without being asked. I just 
24 had to get off, you know what I'm saying? I 
25 couldn't understand that, but my father would tell

1 me, you know, like this is what you got to do. 
2 Cause I come up in rough time, you 
3 know. 
4 I understand, thank you. 
5 To 
6 get some clarification on something. You had let me 
7 see, from the time that first, the shot went off, 
8 Michael is down the street, he is, hands on the back 
9 of the brown car and he's actually facing the 
10 officer still at that time, okay. 
11 A Uh-huh 
12 You see him come away from 
13 the back of the car? 
14 
15 
A Uh-huh. 
And his hands are down by 
16 his side, is that the correct stance? 
17 A As far as I can tell, I couldn't swear on 
18 they were down by his side. It looked, you know, to 
19 me like when he took his hand, you first take your 
20 hand off the car, you know, you're standing. He 
21 took a step and that's when everything just sped up. 
22 Okay. And you see him at 
23 that time, he said it appeared to you that he took 
24 maybe about two or three steps forward? 
25 A Right, uh-huh.

You had to back your car 
Do you recall when you are 
this is a two-lane road? 
12 The officer's vehicle is 
13 already obstructing the roadway. 
14 A Right, right. 
15 So when you're backing up, 
16 are you looking in your side view mirror, your rear 
17 view mirror, side or did you actually turn around?

backed up, 
Gotcha. Let me say this before, when I 
, I said look to the right, what's 
20 coming to the right. I mean, I was looking to the 
21 left, right, because I couldn't hit nothing coming 
22 out the back because the back was just the sidewalk 
23 back there. So I took off ahead this way, and 
24 police hadn't made it there yet, the police hadn't 
25 made it in there until I got back to West

1 Florissant, that's when the police start coming in. 
2 Okay. So you didn't 
3 encounter the other police cars? 
4 A When they got there, no, no, I just see 
5 them coming in past me. 
6 Coming in past you? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 And then from that point 
9 in time, when you are backing up, at what point did 
10 you hear -- you heard the three shots? 
11 A When I backed up, I got like that, by the 
12 time I got straight, pow, pow, pow, I just kept 
13 going. 
14 So you are facing the 
15 other way on Canfield? 
16 A On the last three shots. I'm facing West 
17 Florissant on the three shots, I got turned around. 
18 So during that particular 
19 point in time you can't honestly say, if I can word 
20 this correctly, I don't want to put words in your 
21 mouth or anything like that. 
22 A Right, uh-huh. 
23 It was asked if you ever 
24 saw Michael Brown approach the officer aggressively, 
25 but you said you couldn't see that?

1 A No. 
2 Would that be the reason 
3 why you couldn't have seen that happen? 
4 A Oh, yeah, it could be because my back's 
5 turn, you know what I'm saying? That's the reason 
6 why I tried to get my friend whatever he saw after 
7 that to talk to the officer, you know what I'm 
8 saying? But you know for some reason, he just don't 
9 want to talk to them, you know. 
10 I did get him to call one of the 
11 officers because the officer asked me to tell him to 
12 call him because he kept telling me to tell him to 
13 call him if I saw him. The last two times I saw him 
14 I told him, I say, man, why don't you call these 
15 people so they will leave me alone, you know what 
16 I'm saying? So he said, okay, I'll call them, give 
17 me the number. He said he called and talked to 
18 them, and even my lawyer told me that they had 
19 talked to him. 
20 
21 Mr. 
Okay. Do you know if 
, your passenger, do you know at the time 
22 that you're backing up, I mean, is he still looking 
23 back at the scene as to what's going on? 
24 A Yes, yes, he had to see the rest of the 
25 scene because he was looking to the right for me

1 and, you know, for me watching the street, watch the 
2 other cars as they start coming in, you know what 
3 I'm saying? He was looking back yeah, uh-huh. 
4 As far as I could tell, he was 
5 looking back like this like towards, the passenger 
6 look like that. (indicating) 
7 All right. Thank you. 
8 A All right. 
9 Again, when you 
10 were leaving the scene in your vehicle you said you 
11 passed multiple police cars as they were arriving on 
12 the scene? 
13 
14 
A Right. 
Do you recall if they had 
15 their lights and sirens on? 
16 A Yeah, some of them did. The first one I 
17 think, I scene the second one, I'm not for sure, but 
18 he was behind the first one that had a light on and 
19 then his siren and stuff coming on down, it seemed 
20 like it was coming from the police station right 
21 there on Chambers and across West Florissant on the 
22 other side. I think that's Dellwood, I'm not for 
23 sure.

1 34, I think we understand and it is pretty clear 
2 that you were not looking, you didn't see the very 
3 end of this; is that correct. 
4 
5 
A No, ma'am, I didn't. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Correct. Do you remember 
6 when you were talking to the federal officers back 
7 on September 3rd on page 15. Do you remember when 
8 they were asking you, they asked you, did it look to 
9 you like Mike was coming back to talk with the 
10 officer or did it look like Mike was coming after 
11 the officer, what did it look like to you cause you 
12 said you were scared. 
13 Do you remember saying, you know, I, 
14 something to myself an awful lot, ma'am. Really 
15 honest to God truth, I can't say either way, but you 
16 know, if I was the officer, I would look nervous 
17 too. You coming back toward me and you just hit me, 
18 and you know what I'm saying? You know how like, 
19 you know, but, but I really can't say about that, 
20 ma'am. I'm telling you the truth, do you know what 
21 I'm saying? 
22 Do you remember kind of describing that to 
23 them? 
24 A Oh, yes, ma'am, I remember saying that.

1 back over here again, I'm going to be ducking. I'm 
2 going to be getting out of your way, you know what 
3 I'm saying? I mean, that's just instinct, do you 
4 know what I'm saying? 
5 If someone hit me and I see you, you 
6 know like coming out or whatever, you know, like 
7 that's the way I feel. I'm speaking for me now, you 
8 know what I'm saying? 
9 Q Okay. So if someone had punched you and 
10 then ran away from you, but then turned around and 
11 came back in your direction, you would be a little 
12 on edge or fearful? 
13 A Oh, yes, ma'am. If I had a gun, I 
14 probably would have shot too, really, I'm just 
15 telling you like it is, you know what I'm saying? 
16 You know like, that's just like, I would call it 
17 like, uh, violating. I'm sure if I go to punch that 
18 young fellow, he ain't going to just sit there, you 
19 know what I'm saying? He's going to get up and 
20 knock my teeth out, you know what I'm saying? So

1 that caused him or do you feel like it was anger 
2 that caused the police? 
3 A Caused the police to shoot him? 
4 Yeah. If somebody's 
5 going to hit me, I'm not going to turn --
6 A I never thought about it like that, I 
7 never thought about it being prejudiced or nothing
