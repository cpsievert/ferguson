1 A No, I didn't stick around to tell nobody

Q 
A 
You did your sentence? 
He said I didn't do the crime, okay. And 
13 they figure me no way in that case, you know what 
14 I'm saying? 
15 
16 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
I kept telling them that. When I came to 
17 talk to officers like I'm talking to you now, try to 
18 tell them. Then they just throw me right now, just 
19 because I wouldn't testify against people, you know 
20 what I'm saying?

A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
So you don't like to be --
Page 48 
4 A I don't like them. I know we can't live 
5 without the police, okay, because this world would 
6 be messed up, you know. You turn the TV on all the 
7 time people killing people every day, but I don't 
8 like it when they make a mistake like that and don't 
9 try, you know, to straighten them out. 
10 If someone is telling you over and 
11 over, hey, I didn't do it. At least take the time, 
12 you know, try to see what's going on, you know what 
13 I'm saying? 
14 Like I say, I don't want to see 
15 Michael Brown's family, I don't know how to say 
16 this, I don't want to see nobody hurt. I'm the type 
17 of person, I don't believe in convicting nobody. I 
18 don't believe in accusing nobody of nothing, I don't 
19 really know, you know, what I'm saying. I just 
20 don't like hurting people. 
21 Q So that day you didn't go talk to the 
22 police, but at some point you were talking to 
23 federal authorities and a county detective on 
24 September 3rd, how did that come about? 
25 A They came to my house, they came to my

house and because, I guess, they seen the 
or they heard somebody saying that I told I 
3 know something or something, I don't know, but 
4 anyway, but Wednesday they showed me a picture of my 
5 
6 They got my which is my 
7 , but I drive it. They went to my 
8 and they talked to 
9 As far as I can tell, he told 
10 them 
11 He told them my name and stuff so they start 
12 
13 
looking me up. I used to live on , I moved 
off

So you're saying that basically the police 
Right, right. 
It was because of your ? 
Right, right, and then I went to talk to 
23 them then because I didn't want to get involved and 
24 they gave me a subpoena to come down there to talk 
25 to them. The subpoena, I guess, like you sent me,

1 you know what I'm saying? So I called my lawyer and 
2 asked him, you know, could they do that, you know. 
3 I said, man, I'm here to mind my own business just 
4 trying to enjoy my life, you know what I'm saying? 
5 I want to live what I got left. He said, yes, you 
6 got to go, he said instead of going, he called the 
7 officer and I don't know if he called the officer or 
8 the officer called them so he could meet with them. 
9 So we met with them and talked to them and then I 
10 didn't have to go to this thing here, right. So we 
11 met them the day before or two days before, I'm not 
12 for sure. 
13 Q Let's go back just to clarify. You 
14 actually were given a subpoena to testify in a 
15 but a 
16 different one?

A 
Q 
Right, right, right, not this one. 
And that's because the police somehow 
found you because of your ? 
A Right, that's what I'm figuring. 
Q And that's what they told you, they showed 
you a picture of your and said this is your 
A Yeah. 
Q And you said, yeah?

Yeah, I was driving. 
And here is the subpoena? 
Right. They want something that I didn't 
4 really care for, they said, you come down here of 
5 your own free will. No, I didn't come on my own 
6 free will, I came because you told me I had to, you 
7 know what I'm saying? 
8 Q So once you got the subpoena, you talked 
9 to your attorney and your attorney arranged for you 
10 to come in and be interviewed? 
11 A He said he would be there with me because 
12 like, like you say, I don't trust the police to sit 
13 there and talk to them. There's some type of way, 
14 you know, I don't use all my words right like most 
15 people, but, you know, like they take what I say and 
16 twist it towards me, you know, like ever since then, 
17 I just haven't been comfortable. 
18 Q Okay. So that's how you ended up making a 
19 statement to federal agents is because your attorney 
20 worked it out that you could come in and be 
21 interviewed rather than testify, right? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
That's right. 
And now you know that I had you served 
24 with a subpoena to come here today, right? 
25 A Okay, uh-huh.

1 Q And so when you say you're here of your 
2 own free will, you are only here because I 
3 subpoenaed you?

A 
Q 
A 
Right, correct. 
Are you telling the truth today? 
Yes, yes, you know, like I said, you know, 
7 I've been called a lot of names, but lying isn't one 
8 of them.

We want you to tell us what you saw,

Have I treated you fairly? 
Oh, yes, you know, right, but do you 
16 believe me when I say I just want to be left alone 
17 and just live my life, you know, treat everybody 
18 nice, go to church every now and then. I just want, 
19 that's all I want, you know.
