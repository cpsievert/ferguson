1 MS. WHIRLEY: From firsthand experience 
2 can you tell us? 
3 A I can tell an entrance and exit. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Can you tell us what the 
5 wounds were. 
6 A But on these I couldn't, that's why I 
7 didn't. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
9 The abrasions 
10 that you noticed, were they consistent with where he 
11 would have made contact when he hit the ground with 
12 his forehead and left hand or could that have been 
13 caused by some earlier altercation or something. 
14 A To me it looked like it came from the 
15 ground, that is more of an assumption. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Why does it look like it 
17 came from the ground? 
18 A Because it looked more like a road rash 
19 abrasion as opposed to an altercation abrasion, like 
20 somebody scratching him. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: What's an altercation 
22 abrasion. 
23 A Like somebody punches you in the eye, you 
24 may get a slight, like somebody's knuckles sliding 
25 across your face.

18 up the shirt, take another picture, roll him over,

GRAND JURY HEARING 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. Today's date 
3 is September 3rd, 2014 and it is about, I can't see 
4 my watch, a little before 9:00, 9:55. (sic) This is 
5 Kathy Alizadeh with the Prosecutor's Office and also 
6 present in the room are the 12 jurors and Sheila 
7 Whirley with the Prosecutor's Office and the court 
8 reporter who is taking down everything that's being 
9 said at this point. 
10 Just some preliminary things. First of 
11 all, did everybody get in okay, was there any 
12 confusion, you all got in okay? 
13 
14 
15 
Well, did give you menus for today? 
(All jurors indicate yes.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: What I would like to at 
16 least begin explaining, and we talked to you about 
17 when you want to meet in the future. And we are 
18 going to accommodate you whatever time or date you 
19 would like to meet. Whatever you decide, if you 
20 want to meet, to continue to meet on Wednesdays 
21 because that's what you're used to, we will make 
22 this room available for you on Wednesdays, okay. 
23 We'll do something else with the new grand jury, 
24 they'll meet elsewhere. 
25 So I would suggest that possibly over the

1 lunch break today maybe talk amongst yourselves. 
2 During your lunch break it is not going to be 
3 recorded, you all can talk about amongst yourselves 
4 about future days. 
5 And then maybe at the end of the day today 
6 or after the lunch, we are going to need a list of 
7 some dates. Those dates are not going to be made 
8 public, we're never going to discuss on the record 
9 in advance what dates, you know, you're going to be 
10 meeting, but we'll need to know so we can start 
11 scheduling people. 
12 Keep in mind that unlike typical grand 
13 jury days, we cannot present evidence on this matter 
14 unless all 12 of you are present. 
15 I know you all have the phone number for 
16 the grand jury. If you all make arrangements to 
17 meet on a particular day and then, you know, 
18 somebody gets up in the morning and they're sick, 
19 they've got the flu, you're going to need to call as 
20 soon as possible so we can try to call people and 
21 head them off if they haven't already left their 
22 homes if one of you can't make it, then we're not 
23 going to be able to hear anything that day, okay? 
24 So the 
25 alternates, alternates will not be called in on

1 this, is that my understanding? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: That's correct, they're not 
3 going to have heard everything that you would have 
4 heard. 
5 Okay. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Typically the grand jury 
7 will hear a whole case in a matter of 15 minutes 
8 maybe, but that's not the case here, so there won't 
9 be any alternates that are going to be seated. 
10 All right. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So the way I would like to 
12 progress is that each day when we meet, we're going 
13 to try to be on time and start on time. I think 
14 that's respectful of everybody else. We know you 
15 are dedicating a lot of your time to do this, so 
16 we'll try to be more punctual on future dates. 
17 I also want to tell you as you notice we 
18 have some additional equipment in this room, there 
19 is probably more people in this room than ever 
20 before. I'm probably going to bring in some 
21 additional fans because it will heat up and get warm 
22 in this room. 
23 If anybody at any point feels like they're 
24 feeling, you know, a little overheated, please let 
25 me know because we'll take a break. With this door

1 open when I walk out here it is way cooler out here 
2 than it is in here. If ever you feel like you're, 
3 you know, not being able to be attentive because of 
4 the heat, stop us, okay. 
5 And what I would also like to do is every, 
6 the beginning of every time you meet is to give you 
7 an overview of what to expect for that day. This is 
8 not in the form of like an opening statement where 
9 I'm going to talk about what the evidence is going 
10 to be, I'm just going to give you the names of the 
11 witnesses that we expect to call and who they are 
12 and what we anticipate the content of the topic 
13 they're testifying about. 
14 As you have seen in the past, the witness 
15 will take the stand, be sworn, take the stand and 
16 then I will begin or Sheila will begin by asking the 
17 witness questions. 
18 And I'm not trying to say, I don't want to 
19 discourage anybody from asking any question that 
20 they want to ask, but what I would like to see if 
21 possible, because your questions might be answered 
22 later on in the testimony. Some of these witnesses 
23 are going to have lengthy testimony and at some 
24 point, you know, you might ask a question that I'll 
25 say he's going to talk about that in a minute.

1 If you don't understand something that's 
2 being said at the time, raise your hand, identify 
3 yourself by your juror number and say excuse me, I'm 
4 not understanding what you're saying right now. But 
5 if you have a question that he hasn't, the witness 
6 hasn't seemed to answer yet, if you want to jot that 
7 down in your notes then, you know, at the end, of 
8 course, you know, I will open it up to questions and 
9 Sheila may have additional questions or vice versa 
10 because we are taking turns on putting on different 
11 witnesses because one person can't do all of this. 
12 Are there any questions so far? 
13 There will be times when I'm going to hand 
14 out things to you like maps or reports of other 
15 people just so you can have them for your reference 
16 while you're hearing the testimony. I would 
17 encourage you to still pay attention to the 
18 testimony. 
19 It can be distracting if you are reading 
20 something that's in front of you while a witness is 
21 testifying, you are going to be missing something 
22 that's being said on the stand. Anything that we 
23 give you will be available to you at any time during 
24 the time you're sitting. Certainly for your

1 you've seen before, we'll get those to you. 
2 When you do get maps or reports or 
3 anything of that nature, what I would like you to do 
4 is to just write your juror number on the corner of 
5 it, but I don't want you to put any other writing on 
6 it. 
7 If you have notes you want to take, put 
8 them in your notebook because as we've explained to 
9 you your notebooks are going to be private, they're 
10 locked up, nobody is looking at them and they will 
11 be destroyed at the end of the process here. I 
12 don't want you making notes on anything that is, you 
13 know, not your notebooks, okay. Can we agree with 
14 that? 
15 After our last session Sheila and I sat 
16 down and listened to some parts of the testimony, 
17 the mikes pick up very well. Remember last time I 
18 said I wasn't sure how that was going to go? So I 
19 was kind of encouraging people to lean forward. I 
20 think we're not going to have any problem as long as 
21 people keep their voices up, we should be able to 
22 hear everybody that wants to speak. 
23 And if at all, you know, you cannot hear a 
24 witness as usual, you know, you need to raise your 
25 hand, I can't hear you or I didn't hear what you

2 Any questions about that so far? 
3 Sheila, one other thing I forgot. So the 
4 next time we meet, we will need for you to be on 
5 time because Judge who is the grand 
6 jury judge, is going to be here before we start that 
7 day and she's going to read to you another charge. 
8 When I say charge, it is like she's charging you 
9 with an oath, I guess. 
10 That is having to do with the fact that 
11 you're session is being extended. So I told her, 
12 you know, what time I thought we wanted to get 
13 started. You know she's going to be here a little 
14 before that. So if we can make sure that everybody 
15 is here on time so, you know, she doesn't have to 
16 wait around for us. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: What time we talking, 8:00 
18 or 8:30.

15 disclose to any media outlet or the public in 
16 general your identities, but your families and your

25 all need to work out with the people in your lives.

1 We would like to get this done as quickly 
2 as possible, but then again, we are not going to 
3 rush anything. 
4 If there is a need to meet until after the 
5 first of the year, that's what we are going to do. 
6 I don't anticipate that, but there is no way after 
7 this whole process is over that anybody is going to 
8 say we rushed anything, okay. I want you to have as 
9 much time as you need, hear as much evidence as you 
10 think you need to hear. If we don't call somebody 
11 that you want to hear from, we'll get them here, 
12 okay. 
13 So for the next meeting we'll start at 
14 8:00, the Judge will give you a charge. Today we're 
15 going to have testimony on the investigation into 
16 the shooting of Michael Brown in the morning 
17 session, hopefully we can get done by lunch time. 
18 In the afternoon today you are going to hear a 
19 regular docket of cases that we need to move through 
20 the grand jury. 
21 After that, we anticipate that all of 
22 your, everything you will hear every time you sit 
23 will just be evidence on the investigation into the 
24 shooting of Michael Brown. 
25 I know this is different than other cases

1 because normally when we've charged somebody with an 
2 offense, you have the charge in front of you, you 
3 can read what the charge is, you can read what maybe 
4 the elements are and you don't have that in this 
5 case. 
6 I understand that that kind of leaves you 
7 not sure how you are supposed to look at this 
8 evidence. 
9 So after this morning session, Sheila and 
10 I will sit down and we will come up with statutes 
11 for you on the various degrees of homicide and there 
12 will be some other relevant statutes on the use of 
13 lethal or deadly force when, and possibly 
14 self-defense statutes, so you will have by the time 
15 you are here next time. We'll have that for you so 
16 you can kind of at least understand the law as you 
17 are hearing this evidence. 
18 We're putting on witnesses in a certain 
19 order because we're trying to make this easier for 
20 you to digest and understand the evidence as it 
21 comes in because unlike a trial, I'm not making an 
22 
23 
opening statement. 
the evidence is. 
I can't outline for you what all 
In a trial, you know, a jury gets 
24 to hear that, that's not going to happen here 
25 because I'm not making an opening statement.

1 So we're trying to put the evidence on in 
2 a more logical order so you can kind of understand 
3 as the witnesses progress, oh yeah, I remember 
4 hearing about that the other day. Urn, but as it 
5 happens, sometimes we have scheduling issues with 
6 witnesses, and sometimes things might be out of 
7 order. 
8 There might be an occasion where you hear 
9 testimony from a witness and then you say to me or 
10 Sheila, well, you know, what about that, was that 
11 found at the scene? Well, you're just, I can't 
12 answer those kind of questions for you, you're just 
13 going to have to hope you are going to hear evidence 
14 about that and at the conclusion of all of this, if 
15 you have additional questions and you give us those 
16 questions, we will see if we can get those answered 
17 through witness testimony, okay. 
18 I think the best thing for every day is 
19 for us to tell you how your day is going to go. So 
20 today you are going to hear from two witnesses. The 
21 first witness is St. Louis County Detective, 
22 Detective He is a crime 
23 scene investigator. He will testify about what he 
24 did in relation to his investigation into the 
25 incident that occurred involving the shooting of

1 Michael Brown, okay. 
2 We're going to see pictures, and some of 
3 them are going to be graphic and disturbing and I 
4 have to just get that out there in the beginning. 
5 The next witness we're going to hear from 
6 is going to be I will have him 
7 spell that for you. I don't want to misspell it. 
8 He is the medical examiner who conducted 
9 the autopsy on the body of Michael Brown and he's 
10 going to describe his job and what his findings 
11 were, okay. 
12 So with that, are we ready to get started? 
13 Now, on 
14 the times for next week, we want to be in the garage 
15 at 8:00 so we can be here at 8:30, or we want to be 
16 at the room at 8:00? 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: I think you want to be in 
18 the garage at 8:00, that way you can come through 
19 the way you did. That seemed to work very well 
20 according to So be at the garage at 8:00, 
21 unless you hear differently. I will call you if 
22 something changes, but 8:00 in the garage. That 
23 will probably put us at 8:30, ready for Judge

1 told her earlier this week, 8:30, I thought. 
2 From a frequency 
3 or time allotment standpoint for future weeks, what 
4 is your anticipation from a need, eight hours per 
5 week, two days per week if we can do it, how do we 
6 balance with what you have available to present to 
7 us. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: That's going to depend a 
9 lot on your schedule. Sheila and I have talked 
10 about this. It would be great if we could go five 
11 days a week for as long as it takes to get this 
12 done. As I said to Sheila yesterday, we're not 
13 going to be able to do that. 
14 In a typical case we have a year to 
15 prepare to put on evidence and we don't have that 
16 here. And so, and as you may, you know, find out as 
17 the testimony comes in, we may have additional 
18 witnesses that we don't even know about today that 
19 we will have to, you know, present evidence on. 
20 So that's going to be up to you. If you 
21 guys decide well, we'd like to meet for, you know, 
22 an afternoon on a certain day of the week and all 
23 day on Saturday, you know, or we'd like to meet two 
24 evenings during the week, whatever you all think is 
25 best. Understanding that the more often we meet,

1 the quicker this will go, but I don't think it is 
2 realistic for either side, our side as well as your 
3 side to think that we're going to have, be able to 
4 put this case on Monday through Friday until we get

8 as far as a schedule, okay. 
9 As far as 
10 my job, I know my session is to end next Wednesday,

A 
Q 
A 
Can you state your name and spell it, 
Good morning everybody. My name is 
And where are you employed? 
I am a crime scene detective with St. 
14 Louis County Police.

Q 
A 
Q 
Are you a police officer? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And can you briefly describe for the 
18 jurors what training you went through to become a 
19 police officer? 
20 A After receiving a bachelor's degree, you 
21 attend the police academy. You start as a police 
22 officer like everyone does on the street in a patrol 
23 car. After different various assignments and 
24 training and interviews, I was accepted into the 
25 crime scene unit about five years ago. Once in the

1 crime scene unit, here again, subjected to another 
2 10 to 12 weeks of field training and ongoing classes 
3 and training after that. 
4 Q What does a crime scene investigator, what 
5 is your job, what do you do? 
6 A Primarily our number one job is evidence 
7 at various crime scenes that we are requested to, 
8 photographing evidence, collecting evidence, 
9 diagramming scenes, videotaping various scenes. 
10 Q And so you say that you have been a crime 
11 scene investigator now for approximately five years? 
12 A Yes, ma'am. I was assigned to this unit 
13 in January of 2009. 
14 Q And during the time you have been a crime 
15 scene investigator, have you also received any 
16 additional training either through course work or 
17 attending conferences or seminars that are 
18 particularly directed toward crime scene 
19 investigations? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. Everything from interviewing 
21 interrogation techniques, to scene photography, 
22 setting up death cases, forensic anthropology 
23 courses, several things. 
24 Q So as a general rule, before we get into 
25 the particulars of this investigation, it is fair to

1 say that you have to be called to a crime scene by 
2 other police departments or agencies; is that 
3 correct? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q So you're not driving around in a van 
6 looking for crime scenes? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Not at all. 
So you have a van that you use? 
I do. 
And it has all kinds of things in there 
11 that you use during your investigation; is that 
12 right? 
13 A Equipment, tools, supplies, those sorts of 
14 things. 
15 Q And so when you are called, are you 
16 on-call, like you could be called in at any time? 
17 A There are 17 of us in the unit and we 
18 work, we cover 24 hour shifts. So at any given time 
19 there is a minimum of two of us St. Louis County 
20 crime scene detectives on duty, 24 hours a day. 
21 Q When you receive a call to go to a crime 
22 scene, you get your stuff, go, and you drive your 
23 van to the crime scene; is that right?

25 
A 
Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, typically when you arrive at a crime

Page 23 
1 scene, what's the first thing you do? 
2 A First thing I would do is contact either 
3 the person in charge of the scene or an officer that 
4 knows what's going on. They would typically give me 
5 a rundown what they know at that time and walk me 
6 through the scene to show me, again, what they know, 
7 what occurred and where it occurred. 
8 Q And so it's, you are not the first officer 
9 arriving at a crime scene, other officers are always 
10 there before you; is that right? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes, ma'am. 
And so you talk with them about what they 
13 know, what they might have already found, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Urn, and so after you get that 
16 information, is that necessary for you to then 
17 decide what you are going to document, what you are 
18 going to search for and so forth? 
19 A Yes, it helps greatly knowing what they 
20 know and then I can take my time and start digging 
21 further into finding evidence and stuff like that. 
22 But knowing what they know prior to my arrival helps 
23 me establish a starting point for my investigation. 
24 Q And I would imagine every crime scene is 
25 going to be unique, correct?

A Every one. 1 
2 Q And whether it is a shooting or a burglary 
3 or sexual assault, those are all different crime 
4 scenes, correct? 
5 A Yes, ma'am. 
6 Q So after you have spoken with the officers 
7 there and gotten some information, what's the next 
8 thing you typically do? 
9 A I would walk through the scene with them, 
10 they typically would point out evidence that they've 
11 already found or stuff that may have obvious to 
12 them, stuff that other witnesses or victims may have 
13 shown them already. From that point, for homicide
