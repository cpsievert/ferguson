4 days off.

14 
A 
Q 
A 
Did I say that or did I say it in

I wouldn't be at all surprised, it sounds 
15 something ignorant that I would have said online,

1 take me, you get up in the morning, and you want to 
2 go to a random black neighborhood? 
3 A Correct. I picked Florissant because I 
4 knew a friend that lived up there, or at least I 
5 thought I did. 
6 So you stopped at, okay, 
7 can you tell me how did you get up to the QuikTrip?

5 
6 
7 
8 way. 
A 
A 
Highway, yes. 
They told you --
They told me one way and I went the other 
9 Which way did you go? 
10 A I believe it was to the left and then to 
11 the left again. 
12 And you did what, you 
13 turned around? 
14 A No, I ended up in the complex. 
15 You can't figure out how 
16 you got there, but you can figure out how you got 
17 inside the apartment complex? 
18 
19 
20 
A From QT. I don't know how I got from 
to where I was, no. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Can I interrupt here, don't 
21 spend much time looking for a transcript because I'm 
22 thinking maybe we don't have one. I don't have one 
23 in my folder. And so I want to make sure everybody 
24 is catching what's being said and I will double 
25 check to see if we have one, but I'm kind of

1 thinking we don't. That would explain why no one 
2 can lay their hands on one. All right, I'm sorry to 
3 interrupt, but I didn't want anybody looking for 
4 something that wasn't there. 
5 So this random black 
6 neighborhood, did you find it? 
7 A Did I find it? Yes, turned out to be 
8 Ferguson. 
9 Okay you just kind of 
10 
11 
A I know lives in Florissant, but at 
the time I thought lived off of Florissant and 
12 the address I have 
13 You already stated that 
14 your intentions was notes to see ? 
15 A Correct. What I said was that was not the 
16 intent, but that -- can you reread what I said? 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: About when? 
18 A I was going up there 
19 To find a random 
20 neighborhood. 
21 A I'm sorry? 
22 Okay. 
23 Let her finish talking and then you ask her again 
24 what you want her to answer. Don't talk over top of 
25 her because we don't understand what you say or what

1 she say. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: And that is true. Also for 
3 the court reporter because he can't, it is very 
4 tough for him to take it down when people are 
5 talking at the same time. So go ahead, continue. 
6 I'm just 
7 getting to the point where you said you were going 
8 to find a random black neighborhood and then you 
9 just made a statement you were looking for 
10 that lived in Florissant. I'm trying to figure 
11 which one is it? 
12 A That's not the reason I went up there. I 
13 went to find the random black neighborhood like my 
14 journal says. Then I thought, I mean, I picked that 
15 neighborhood because of had no idea that I 
16 was anywhere in the area or that I was coming. 
17 You picked the 
neighborhood before you left ? 18 
19 A Correct. I picked the general vicinity, 
20 yes. 
21 When 
22 you are reading your journal from 4:00, basically 
23 what I have here is you explained what you saw, and 
24 it wasn't a lot of previous statements that you said 
25 before, a lot of it was different. But in your

1 journal you said the little one had the cops leg? 
2 A Correct, that's what I remember at the 
3 time that I wrote this. 
4 Okay. 
5 
6 
A I don't know where that came in. 
Okay. And I just want to 
7 make sure, you know, I understand that you are 
8 confused and it helps us. 
9 A I know it sounds like I'm lying too, 
10 that's why--
11 I don't think you are 
12 lying, I believe you are confused, I think you are 
13 confused. I understand that. I want to know, just 
14 look at me and tell me, what you are telling us --
15 A Yes, ma'am. 
16 Is you saw Michael Brown 
17 charging the officer without a doubt in your mind. 
18 This young man didn't have a reason to do this, so 
19 could you have been mistaken about what you saw? 
20 A It looked to me like he was going after 
21 the officer like a football player. 
22 Okay. 
23 A 
24 No.
