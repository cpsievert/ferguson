GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME X 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
Page 5 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is October 6th. This is 
5 Kathi Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office. 
6 Present is Sheila Whirley with the prosecutor's 
7 office. All 12 grand jurors are present here today, 
8 as well as , the stenographer, who is taking 
9 down and recording matters that are going on today 
10 in the grand jury. 
11 It is about 8:39 a.m., and my 
12 understanding is we are going to go to about 2:30 
13 today, correct? We have a witness that's here 
14 already this morning. Her name is 
15 We heard from her husband, 
16 last week. 
17 She wanted to come in first thing in the 
18 morning, so we're going to go ahead and have her 
19 testify first, and after her testimony, we will 
20 listen to the statement of and 
21 We didn't get a chance to do 
22 that last week. 
23 I have a witness scheduled to be here at 
24 1:00 this afternoon. So her name is 
25 and she is the fiancee, or girlfriend, I can't

3 So we'll probably listen to her statement 
4 in the morning if we have time. We probably should, 
5 and then at this point, we might be done for the day 
6 after testifies. 
7 Sheila and I have been talking about 
8 trying to schedule your time and make use of your 
9 time as best we can. We're running into the issue 
10 now that some of these witnesses are not very 
11 anxious to come in and meet with you. And so we're 
12 going to probably need to be searching for some 
13 people and giving them written invitations to appear 
14 before you. 
15 So I'm trying desperately to get your day 
16 scheduled tomorrow, so I know you are here until 
17 6:00. We want to be able to keep you busy all day. 
18 And then we've got, I've got some 
19 witnesses lined up, and then on Thursday we have 
20 witnesses lined up too, but as of right now, I don't 
21 have necessarily the whole day filled. So we'll try 
22 our best. And it may be that we go ahead and call 
23 some other witnesses. 
24 We have lab people, we have police

1 Q This is Caddiefield Road, this is also 
2 Caddiefield Road because it goes around like that. 
3 A Can I stand? This is hard for me to do 
4 because it's peripheral vision, I'm not used to 
5 looking at. 
6 Q Correct, I understand. Do you know the 
7 number of unit? 
8 A I think it is this one right here. 
9 Q Okay. So when you proceeded down Canfield 
10 Drive, you turned on Caddiefield, did you park in a 
11 parking space? 
12 A Right here. This is building, I 
13 believe, and would have parked right in here. 
14 (indicating) 
15 Q Okay. Now, did you have, do you recall if 
16 your windows were up or down? 
17 A That I don't remember. It was hot, I 
18 imagine that the air was on. It was hot that day.

vehicles approaching you? 
No. 
In your direction?

1 Q And so did you, after you parked your car, 
2 what's the first thing you noticed going on around 
3 here? 
4 A Well, once we were going up the steps, the 
5 police car came down going towards West Florissant, 
6 and I said to my husband, oh, he's going to stop 
7 them and tell them to get on the sidewalk. 
8 
9 the steps. 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Urn, and we just kind of proceeded up 
Now, earlier you had pointed to this one. 
See, I'm not used to looking at these. So 
12 once we got on the landing, the police officer had 
13 stopped and said something to them. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Now, could you hear what he said? 
No, I'm assuming, I'm not going to say he 
16 said, but from the activities that we saw from the 
17 porch, he stopped and the kids, the children 
18 stopped. I don't know what he said, I didn't hear 
19 that, we were too far away to hear. I'm just 
20 assuming that he said the same thing I had said to 
21 my husband, get on the sidewalk. 
22 Q So now you, the stairs that go up to the 
23 apartment unit, those are exterior stairs, correct? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So you're going up the stairs and you're

A 
Q 
A 
Uh-huh. 
What floor did live on? 
There is only three floors. There is the 
5 basement and that would be the first floor and then 
6 the second floor, or you can say the second floor 
7 and then the third. 
8 
9 
10 
Q on the top level? 
A No, on the second. Well, there is a 
basement apartment and then apartment. So

12 how they classify the floors.

idea, were we talking a matter 
6 of seconds or a minute or two that he paused and 
7 there was some kind of exchange between those kids?

9 
A 
Q 
10 happen? 
11 A 
It may have been maybe a minute. 
And then what happened, what did you see 
He said whatever he said, then we heard 
12 two gunshots. He was still in the car, the boys 
13 were outside of the car. Well, before we heard the 
14 gunshots, I don't know what he said or what they 
15 said or what the conversation was, but the car was 
16 headed west on Caddiefield, on Canfield, and he, I 
17 guess, backed the car up and was at an angle. 
18 Q Let me ask you this. The time when he 
19 paused that you thought that he might have been 
20 saying, hey, get on the sidewalk, or what you 
21 assumed he might have said, was that after he backed 
22 up? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
No, it was before. 
Okay. So he stops, pauses for a little 
25 bit, and then does the vehicle proceed west on

1 Canfield then a little ways? 
A Yes, uh-huh. 2

4 
Q 
A 
And do the boys, what do the boys do? 
They just were kind of standing there, 
5 and, like I said, it happened really fast, but the 
6 car was headed east, and then whatever conversation 
7 they had, the officer backed the car back, but it 
8 was at an angle and that's when we heard two 
9 gunshots inside the vehicle. 
10 Q Okay. So when the officer, I think you 
11 said east, but you meant west, right? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
I'm sorry. 
He's going westbound and then he puts it 
14 in reverse, backs up, and he's at a little bit of an 
15 angle in the street? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Did you hear tires squealing or screeching 
18 or anything? 
19 A No, it wasn't like it was a chase or 
20 anything. I mean, he just, I mean, I don't know 
21 what happened, they exchanged words, I'm quite sure, 
22 and, you know, you just, I think he kind of whipped 
23 the car in reverse so it was at an angle. 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Not a full complete angle, it was no

2 Q When the first time the officer 
3 encountered the boys, were the boys on the driver's 
4 side of his car or on the passenger side? 
A 5 All the way on the driver's side. 
6 When he reversed it around to where it was Q 
at an 7 angle, are the boys still on the driver's 
8 side?
