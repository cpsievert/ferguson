And is he, how long has been 
3 an employee? 
4 A I'm not sure, I don't know exactly. 
5 Q And what does he do for the medical 
6 examiner? 
7 A He's an autopsy technician and he's, he's 
8 responsible for one, helping me during my 
9 examinations. He's helpful for, you know, drawing 
10 any fluids I need for toxicology. He's helpful for 
11 weighing the body, checking in the body, and check 
12 the body for any type of personal belongings. 
13 Q And you've already testified that when the 
14 body was received by the Medical Examiner's Office 
15 and eventually the body bag was unlocked and opened, 
16 that Michael Brown still had his clothes on him; is 
17 that correct?

1 some of the morgue photos? 
A Yes, he does. 2 
3 Q And you testified that it's procedure for 
4 someone such as to check the personal items 
5 that might be on the body, any body that is received 
6 by the medical examiner's, correct? 
7 A That is correct. 
8 Q And then once the personal items are 
9 removed, are they photographed? 
10 A Yes, they are. 
11 Q All right. So previously I had introduced 
12 or offered or identified for the grand jurors a 
13 packet of photographs which I marked as Number 9, 
14 which are, I call the morgue photos. Those are 
15 different than the photos that the police took 
16 during the autopsy; is that right? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q Okay. And so I'm going to hand you a 
19 photo which was, is in the packet of Grand Jury 
20 Exhibit Number 9, and this is, on the back it says 
21 looks like, well, it says 039CD. I'm not sure if 
22 that's the JPEG number or not. But I'm going to 
23 just show you where I'm reading 039CD on the back 
24 there. And then I'm going to show you this photo.

Q 
Yes, I do. 
Okay. And the items in this photo would

3 Q And you indicated or you testified last 
4 time that you thought that that looked suspicious 
5 for possible soot or something that you wanted to 
6 examine further? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And you also testified back then that you 
9 had cut a piece of that tissue off of the body for 
10 you to then later examine; is that right? 
A Correct. 11 
12 Q So I know you've already testified about 
13 that, but we, I want to go into a little more detail 
14 because since you were in grand jury, you've 
15 completed a report about your examination of that 
16 tissue, correct? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q And so once you cut that tissue out 
19 because you and I talked about this in a little 
20 greater detail since you were here previously, once 
21 you cut that tissue out, what did you do with it? 
22 A Okay. So anything that I have on the body 
23 that I'm concerned about that I would like to 
24 perform histology on, which I will get to in a 
25 second. I take that fresh tissue, I mean, it hasn't

1 been altered or anything, it hasn't been washed, it 
2 hasn't been manipulated. I take those pieces of 
3 tissue and I put them in a cassette. The cassette 
4 is simply a plastic chamber that holds the tissue so 
5 that it doesn't get lost or moves around and it 
6 stays positioned how it's put when I put it in the 
7 gray cassette. 
8 From that point I take that gray 
9 cassette and I put it in another container and it is 
10 filled with a fluid called formalin. Formalin is 
11 simply a preservative that gets the tissue in a 
12 state of preservation where it can now be prepared 
13 for the next step of processing. 
14 So when I took the piece of tissue 
15 off to put in a cassette and I put it in formalin 
16 for later processing, that's what I did initially. 
17 Q So did you do with then, is it still in 
18 this cassette then? 
19 A Yes, the tissue remains in that cassette 
20 in that fluid until it is transported to another 
21 facility where they will process the tissue. 
22 Q Okay. And so where does the tissue go 
23 from there? 
24 A So after it leaves my position at the St. 
25 Louis County Medical Examiner's Office, it is then

Q 
A 
Yes, I do recognize what is in these 
And what are those pictures of? 
The pictures that I'm looking at right now 
14 are the samples of tissue that I took from 
15 Mr. Michael Brown's right hand that I put in that 
16 formalin liquid that I spoke with you earlier, 
17 transported it to the St. Louis Medical School for 
18 Histology and then it is processed. That tissue is 
19 then put in a wax to keep everything positioned and 
20 that's what I'm looking at right now.

22 has put the tissue in a wax?

8 the cassette or is that a box? 
9 A It could be either/or. It could be 
10 representative of the cassette or something else 
11 that they used. 
12 Q So these reddish, beige-ish brown things 
13 inside, that's the actual tissue? 
14 A Yes.

16 the same tissue; is that correct?

2 you had removed? 
3 A Yes, I do. 
4 Q Okay. And I just put on the overhead 
5 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 1 through 5 to show the 
6 grand jurors. 
7 Now, we see this is a larger kind of 
8 tray, do you know what that is? 
9 A It was just a tray for transportation 
10 purposes. 
11 Q Okay. All right. So once the medical 
12 school histology lab places this tissue in paraffin, 
13 what does it do then to prepare it for examination? 
14 A So after the tissue is put in that wax 
15 substance that you saw, that's the paraffin 
16 material, at that point, that block of tissue is now 
17 taken to be sliced with a microtone blade, which is 
18 a very sharp blade that slices very thin segments, 
19 about five micrometers, which is very thin, pieces 
20 of wax tissue with the tissue embedded. 
21 That slice is then put on a glass 
22 slide and it is then counterstained by adding a pink 
23 solution and a purple solution. One is called eosin 
24 and the other is called hematoxylin. And then that 
25 slide now has been prepared where I can look at it

2 level. 
3 Q Did you ultimately receive some slides 
4 from the medical school that were actual, this 
5 tissue that you had removed from Michael Brown's 
6 right palm? 
7 A Yes, I do. 
8 Q Okay. Did you examine those slides under 
9 a microscope? 
A Yes, I did. 10 
11 Q And again, you've already testified about 
12 this, but I'm going to, did you take photographs of 
13 those slides as well? 
14 A I did take some photographs of the slides. 
15 Q Okay. 
16 A Or representative photos of some of the 
17 pieces. It is not everything. 
18 Q And you know, Dr. , I didn't have 
19 the opportunity to show you this this morning 
20 because by the time you got here, the grand jurors 
21 were already here. So I'm going to show you a 
22 photograph that's on Disc Number 79, Grand Jury

2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes, I did. 
Okay. And we're going to hear from that 
4 doctor after we hear from you. Actually, just have 
5 to ask you if you recognize this picture? 
6 A 
7 Q 
8 there? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, I do. 
You recognize what you are seeing up 
Yes, I do. 
And so is this a picture of what you would 
11 see in the microscope when you were examining that 
12 tissue? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q And does this picture help you to explain 
15 to the grand jurors what you are looking at when you 
16 previously testified that you saw some particulate? 
17 A Just to take a step back and just to 
18 preface again, this is just, there are a lot of 
19 pieces of tissue that you saw on that paraffin 
20 embedded block. So when you take a slice of that, 
21 all of those slices are represented on one slide. 
22 So what you are looking at right now 
23 is just a small corner of one of those tissue 
24 fragments. So we are not looking at all of those 
25 slices at one time.

1 So this is merely just a corner or a 
2 piece of some of that tissue. 
3 Q You can use this if you feel it will help 
4 you. It will pick up your voice. 
5 A All right. So for histology, what I was 
6 telling you about the colors and the purple and the 
7 pink, once that waxed tissue is stained, it give us 
8 this pinkish color and some of these things here is 
9 the purple color. I spent a lot of time knowing 
10 what each thing is, I will just try to keep it as 
11 simple as possible. 
12 So you are looking at the edge of the 
13 tissue and the tissue that I took was from that 
14 wound that I passed around and showed up before. I 
15 took little samples of those and those were 
16 represented in the paraffin block that I showed you. 
17 This is the histology. 
18 So here, this is just regular, you 
19 know, normal tissue of the hand, this pinkish 
20 material, but here you can see these little darker 
21 areas, these little pigmented flakes, these are the 
22 foreign particulate matter that I was talking about 
23 that is not native to his hand. It had to be 
24 introduced into his hand from another source and 
25 that's some of those particulate matter that I was

1 talking about previously. Like that right there, 
2 that right there, that right there. (indicating) 
3 As I said before, this is merely just 
4 a representation, there are other areas on this 
5 slide, but this is just a representative of some of 
6 that matter that I saw. 
7 Q And so you have already testified that in 
8 your opinion those particulate, the particulate? 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Particulate matter. 
Matter, that is consistent with soot? 
I would say it is consistent with products 
12 that are discharged from a firearm. What I was 
13 telling you guys before, there is lots of things 
14 that can come out of a firearm. Remember I was 
15 telling you guys talking about the primer, the 
16 primer on the cartridge is the combustible material 
17 that ignites that, then lights the gunpowder, which 
18 then propels the bullet. All of those substances 
19 together are kind of coming out of that barrel. 
20 So the definition of soot is actually 
21 burned gunpowder. So there can be different types 
22 of things in there. You can have burned, you can 
23 have unburned, you probably could have primer, have 
24 lots of different types of materials. 
25 For myself, a better way to say it is

1 this is just foreign particulate matter consistent 
2 with products that can be discharged from the 
3 firearm. 
4 So soot could be in there, I mean, 
5 it's a lot of material. 
6 Q Now, did you do any testing to determine

In my area, I do not do that. 
Okay. And, Dr. , could those 
14 black or darker particulate matters that we can see 
15 on that image on the slide, could that be dirt? 
16 A In my personal opinion it is not. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 A But it is due to the circumstances and 
19 things that I know about in this case why I feel 
20 that that's not dirt. 
21 Q And what would those circumstances be that 
22 you feel that it's not dirt? 
23 A So, got to kind of follow me here, okay.

Page 22 
1 something of interest that I'm trying to see. 
2 So in this particular situation when 
3 I look at some Michael Brown's hand there was kind 
4 of an area of discoloration in his thumb area on his 
5 right hand that I was concerned about that this 
6 could be some type of material discharged from a 
7 firearm. 
8 To myself in looking at it, it is 
9 kind of like an experience thing, when I was looking 
10 at it, just the color of it, the nature of it, it 
11 didn't look like dirt to me. Specifically right 
12 near the wound, when I think about dirt, we have all 
13 been children or working on things that you have 
14 dirt, like dirt is all over your hands, it is not 
15 like in one little particular corner. 
16 So essentially it was associated with 
17 that particular area and it just looked different to 
18 me. I did not think that this was dirt and that's 
19 why I decided to take the next step to look under 
20 the microscope to confirm what I was looking at 
21 through my eyes. 
22 So that the next step was doing 
23 histology. So when I did this and I saw these 
24 little molecules here, the fact that they are very 
25 darkly pigmented, they are embedded in the tissue,

1 it is hard for dirt to introduce itself into tissue. 
2 Dirt usually sits on top of things, it doesn't get 
3 into things. 
4 So the fact that this is in the 
5 tissue, that let's me know that it had to be 
6 introduced into the tissue and that is going to be 
7 more consistent with products that are going to be 
8 discharged from a firearm that would be able to 
9 insert itself or get itself into those tissue. So 
10 that's why I feel this is not dirt, and this is 
11 particulate matter from the discharge from the 
12 firearm, if that makes sense. 
13 Q And, Dr. , we talked about the 
14 fact that, you know, you've already testified about 
15 what the immediate affects would have been to 
16 Michael Brown once the gunshot wound that entered 
17 the top of his head and traveled through his brain 
18 and exited out by his jawline, somewhere around 
19 there, that that was actually, would have 
20 immediately rendered him incapacitated? 
21 A Right. And just to back up, the wound 
22 that was going to be the more incapacitating, you 
23 know, the one that actually went in the top of the 
24 head and stayed in, there was another one that came 
25 over the brow that came out of the face, but the one

1 that went in and stayed in, that's the one that was 
2 going to render him immediately unconscious. 
3 Q And a person who was still perhaps on his 
4 feet who would receive that wound would immediately 
5 fall? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q And would they be able to put their hand 
8 out to brace themself for a fall? 
A No. 9 
10 Q I don't know if you've seen those 
11 photographs at this time. These were images that 
12 were taken at the crime scene by Detective 
13 and they are contained in a packet that I've 
14 marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 3. And I'm going 
15 to show you Image Number 70 through 75, which are

20 Q And if you can look at various pictures 
21 because it might show different views of that. His 
22 right hand is alongside his body, a little out from

1 because 
2 A I will try my best. So start from the 
3 very beginning, upper left-hand corner you have 
4 Michael Brown and then upper right-hand corner you 
5 have our case number 2014-5143, exam case. And then 
6 it is headed as Supplemental Microscopic Examination 
7 Report. 
8 Then the next line is, Microscopic 
9 Slide Examination. 
10 And then the next paragraph, that's 
11 where I start to begin to describe some of the 
12 particular features that I'm seeing on the slides 
13 that were prepared of Mr. Mike Brown's gunshot wound 
14 to the hand. 
15 So starting with skin and muscle I 
16 say, sections of the tissue from the right hand show 
17 multiple fragments of skin and single fragment of 
18 skeletal muscle. 
19 What I was telling you before there 
20 is all of those little bits of tissue there, there 
21 is different fragments there and then one of those 
22 pieces was a piece of muscle, but it is not 
23 represented on what you just saw there. That was 
24 just one of the pictures and there is lots of things 
25 to look at, but that's in totality what I'm looking

1 at. 
2 So all of those fragments in that 
3 tissue block I looked at each individual one of 
4 them, every little corner under the microscope, so 
5 that is what that first sentence means. 
6 Next, I say there is a darkly 
7 pigmented foreign particulate matter present on the 
8 superficial surface. 
9 So that dark material that you guys 
10 saw, that is more in a deeper layer of the tissue, 
11 but on the top. Like if you think of the top of a 
12 cake, some of that similar type of material is 
13 sitting on the superficial, that means the top 
14 portion of some of those skin fragments. 
15 And the stratum corneum, on your hand 
16 skin has different layers. On your palmer skin, you 
17 have a very thick layer called stratum corneum, it 
18 is kind of the more superficial layer of your skin. 
19 It is kind of like where your skin eventually sheds 
20 and it's kind of similar to what dandruff is. That 
21 is what the stratum corneum is. 
22 So that particular layer there is 
23 pigmented material embedded within that superficial 
24 layer. 
25 As I was telling you before,

1 something has to introduce or cause those little 
2 particles to get pushed into that particular area, 
3 and that's what I'm talking about right here. 
4 Also embedded within the stratum 
5 corneum of the skin fragments. A mixture of 
6 pigmented and non-pigmented foreign particulate 
7 matter is present focally within the dermis. 
8 So when I was showing you that 
9 previous picture, there was pigmented material, that 
10 was the darker material and there was some, some 
11 things a little white in there, kind of shiny, 
12 that's the non-pigmented material. So there is a 
13 spectrum of items within the skin and that pink area 
14 that I was showing you, that's the dermis. 
15 So when you have skin, you have the 
16 stratum corneum, you have a granular layer, beneath 
17 that you start to get into your connective tissue 
18 layer of your skin, which is the next layer beneath 
19 and that's where you will kind of see pinkish 
20 tissue, that's the dermis. 
21 So in the dermis, deeper into the 
22 tissue below the skin, you still have those little 
23 foreign particulate matter introduced into the 
24 tissue. 
25 So some of the skin tissue fragments

1 within the skeletal muscle tissue fragment. So as I 
2 was telling you before, in all of those little 
3 pieces that I had there were different types of 
4 tissue, I had a piece of skeletal muscle. Skeletal 
5 muscle is even deeper than the skin, deeper than the 
6 dermis and the next layer will be muscle. 
7 So deep in that tissue injury I took 
8 some muscle out too. The muscle that I looked at 
9 under the scope also had some of that foreign 
10 particulate matter. So this matter, this foreign 
11 material was getting embedded deep into the tissues. 
12 Some of the non-pigmented particulate 
13 matter is polarizable. All that means is that when 
14 you polarize something, polarize means basically 
15 reflecting light. So there is some of the material 
16 that's in there is able to reflect light and some of 
17 the material doesn't. It is kind of a nonspecific 
18 thing, but it is important for me to describe 
19 everything that I'm seeing to let, you know, let 
20 people know that there is a mixture of things in 
21 here. 
22 But some reflect light, some don't. 
23 The previously described particles of foreign 
24 particulate matter are consistent with the products 
25 that are discharged from a barrel of a firearm.

1 That last statement is simply meaning 
2 that the things that I'm seeing under the scope in 
3 my opinion are being introduced into the hand as 
4 foreign material coming from another source. And 
5 that other source, in my opinion, what I'm seeing is 
6 consistent with coming from the barrel of a firearm, 
7 not being dirt introduced from another place, but 
8 specifically coming from something else due to the 
9 nature of the particles, how they're distributed in 
10 the skin, where they are distributed in the skin, 
11 and how they got into those particular levels. 
12 Q Dr. , you previously testified 
13 about how close the barrel or the muzzle or the end 
14 of the barrel of a firearm would need to be deposit 
15 those type of particulate or those products once the 
16 firearm is discharged. 
17 Can you give us an estimate or a 
18 range as to how far away the barrel would have been? 
19 A In my opinion, the range would be about 6 
20 to 9 inches away. 
21 Q Okay. Could, do you have a terminology 
22 that you use such as contact, close contact, medium 
23 range or something of that nature? 
24 A I would say this is consistent with a 
25 close range wound.

1 Q Okay. Now, contact wound that would be 
2 with someone actually, the barrel could possibly be 
3 touching the skin; is that right? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q Could you, if the barrel was touching the 
6 skin, would it look the same or different? 
7 A It would look different. 
8 Q Okay. And so, in your opinion, is it your 
9 opinion that the barrel of the gun was not touching 
10 the hand of Michael Brown if, in fact, one is to 
11 conclude that this is gunshot products from a gun? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
That the actual barrel of the gun would 
14 not have been up against the hand? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, let's talk about one more finding 
17 that you made after you had testified previously. 
18 You were given something to examine that was 
19 described by our St. Louis County Crime Laboratory 
20 as skin or hardened nasal mucus? 
A Correct. 21 
22 Q Were you aware that the St. Louis County 
23 Lab had done a DNA analysis on that --

2 Q Were you aware that they had concluded 
3 that, whatever that thing was, contained Michael 
4 Brown's DNA?

So was that thing given to you for you to

Q

Okay. 
it was. 
And what did you 
10 in order to determine what it was? 
do with that thing 
11 A So as I described to you all previously 
12 with those tissue fragments from Mr. Michael Brown's 
13 hand, that process of taking the fresh tissue, 
14 putting it in the formalin, putting it in the 
15 cassettes, sending it to SLU for processing, getting 
16 it sliced out of the paraffin block, put it on the 
17 microscopic slide, getting it stained and then 
18 coming back to me on a glass slide. That whole 
19 process happened again with this extra piece of 
20 tissue that I was given to look at independently. 
21 Q And when you looked at it, did you make 
22 any findings as to what that thing was? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, I did. 
And what did you conclude that it was? 
I determined that it's a fragment of skin

1 associated with some connective tissue, that's just 
2 supportive tissue beneath the skin layer. 
3 Q Can you tell where on the body that skin 
4 comes from? 
A Urn, not definitively. 5 
6 Q Okay. Do you have an educated guess or in 
7 your medical opinion, do you suspect it comes from 
8 one place as opposed to another? 
9 A Urn, I guess I'll preface it with this. 
10 Within a skin sample, there's a variety of cellular 
11 elements meaning different types of cells that are 
12 present within our bodies and, urn, at times there is 
13 a cell called melanocyte. It's our cell that's 
14 responsible for producing pigment. 
15 That particular cell when it makes 
16 its pigment, it kind of gives it away to another 
17 cell type, which is called a keratinocyte. In this 
18 particular cell at the junction between the dermis 
19 where I was telling you guys that connective tissue 
20 layer is, it's at the bottom part of the legitimate 
21 skin layer. 
22 These two cells are kind of in 
23 contact with each other and they communicate. So 
24 the melanocyte makes the pigment, gives it to the 
25 keratinocyte, which kind of absorbs it and then it

1 kind of allows skin to kind of display its pigmented 
2 characteristics. 
3 And the particular sample that I 
4 received to look at independently, there are 
5 keratinocytes there, but they are not picking up a 
6 lot of pigment. 
7 So in my personal opinion, this 
8 particular skin fragment has to be from an area of 
9 the skin that is not highly pigmented. There is a 
10 few places on the body, especially for someone whose 
11 skin is of a pigmented nature, where you can have a 
12 more likely pigmented type skin. 
13 And I'd like to show you, if you look 
14 on the back side of my hand here, if I looked under 
15 a scope on a piece of my skin under the microscope, 
16 I would see more pigmented keratinocytes present, 
17 but on this side of my hand it is more lightly 
18 pigmented, they are not going to be as prominent or 
19 being as significant. 
20 So saying all of that, the fact that 
21 that's specimen that I do have, there aren't a lot 
22 of pigmented keratinocytes. So I suppose that this 
23 fragment is coming from an area where the skin is 
24 lightly pigmented.
