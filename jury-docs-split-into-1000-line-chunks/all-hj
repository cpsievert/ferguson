20 fair? 
21 A I did, yes. 
22 Q Why don't you explain for the grand jurors 
23 about what, if anything, is different about your 
24 investigation in this case? 
25 A Sure. When I answered that question last 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 22 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 week, I was referring to the fact that Darren Wilson 
2 was treated no differently in this investigation 
3 than other officers have been treated in any other 
4 investigation we have conducted or that I have 
5 conducted. 
6 He received no special treatment and 
7 1n terms of the investigation, the same legal and 
8 general procedural guidelines were followed in this 
9 investigation as they were in any other officer 
10 involved incident that I have conducted. 
11 Having said that from the beginning, 
12 there were certain aspects of the investigation that 
13 were different. Typically we would do a 
14 walk-through at the scene with the individual 
15 involved in the incident, that wasn't possible 1n 
16 this particular instance based off of circumstances 
17 taking place at the scene. It wouldn't have been 
18 safe, I felt, for him to go back to the scene and do 
19 a walk-through at the scene. In a relatively short 
20 period of time, there was a significant amount of 
21 media attention that had been garnered regarding 
22 this incident and obviously, that can impact 
23 witnesses' statements if a witness sees media 
24 account of it, so that would have obviously impacted 
25 this investigation more so than previous 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 23 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 investigations. The FBI and Department of Justice, 
2 obviously, began conducting a parallel investigation 
3 within a relatively short period of time. And that 
4 obviously lent itself to a variety of coordination 
5 issues that needed to happen, a variety of other 
6 laboratory reports that we would have needed to get, 
7 other methods of doing things. In that sense, there 
8 were things that we did differently. 
9 And also just in terms of the sheer 
10 volume of work and the amount of witnesses that we 
11 contacted that was different in this particular 
12 instance, based on the amount of people that needed 
13 to be contacted, the amount of evidence that was 
14 presented. And so in some instances, I was at the 
15 same time as much a project manager as I was an 
16 investigator. 
17 But ultimately there were a lot of 
18 things that were, I should say, different about this 
19 investigation, but it is nothing that would have 
20 impacted the integrity of the investigation or the 
21 manner 1n which Darren Wilson was treated, so I just 
22 wanted to clarify that. 
23 Q All right. And 1n the course of this 
24 investigation within hours of the shooting, you did 
25 have a number of people who actually came forward 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 24 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and indicated that they had witnessed the incident; 
2 1s that correct? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And you learned shortly after the shooting 
5 that there was an individual who was with Mike Brown 
6 during the shooting and did it take several days for 
7 you to identify him and to contact him? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
It did. 
And then during this investigation were 
10 there also a number of witnesses that did not come 
11 forward that you were able to later identify either 
12 through canvass1ng or through other investigative 
13 techniques such as getting phone records, Facebook 
14 records, Twitter records and so forth, to try to 
15 locate people who might have seen something? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes, that's correct. 
And so is that something that was atypical 
18 1n your investigation of an officer involved 
19 shooting the vast number of witnesses that actually 
20 were not coming forward on their own? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
It was, yes. 
Urn, all right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm go1ng to then kind of 
24 resume with talking about this perspective picture. 
25 At this time does anybody have any questions, of 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 25 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 course, you can always ask later as well. Before I 
2 move on to doing these pictures again, anybody have 
3 questions about the investigation itself or things 
4 that were done or not done? 
5 Okay, all right. So now, Detective 
6 we had you testify Thursday about this map, 
7 which is marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 101. What 
8 are these? 
9 A Extra. 
10 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Extra, okay, that's 
11 right. And you indicated that you, along with other 
12 investigators prepared this, which is your 
13 interpretation based upon the statements made of 
14 witnesses as to where various eyewitnesses were 
15 during, when I say shooting, obviously, there was a 
16 time period that goes along, the beginning of the 
17 time of the beginning of the incident until after 
18 the shooting had been done. And do you still feel 
19 that this map accurately reflects where witnesses 
20 said they were? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I do. 
And just for your instruction, this just, 
23 this map is for your purposes in your deliberations 
24 and if you disagree with anything that's on the map, 
25 these little sticky things come right off. So 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 26 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 supposedly they come right off. 
2 A They do. 
3 Q If you feel that this witness is not in 
4 the right place, you can move any of these stickers 
5 that you want and put them in the places where you 
6 think they belong. 
7 This 1s just something that is 
8 representative of what this witness believes where 
9 people were. If you all do with this what you will. 
10 Also there was a legend that was 
11 provided for all of you regarding the numbers 
12 because the numbers that were assigned witnesses are 
13 not the same numbers as the witnesses testimony in 
14 this grand Jury. 
15 So Witness Number 10 in the grand 
16 Jury 1s not necessarily Number 10 on this chart. 
17 Actually, he's Number 6. So those numbers for the 
18 map are only for the map, okay. Is that fair to 
19 everybody? 
20 All right. Now 
21 GRAND JUROR: I just want to clarify, the 
22 red where it says Michael Brown, that is where he 
23 died, that is where he fell? 
24 
25 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: You don't indicate anywhere 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 27 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 where he was to begin with, just where he fell? 
2 A Just where he fell, yes. 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the blue would be 
4 where the police officer's car was when you began 
5 your investigation, correct? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So these photographs, which we already 
8 started some testimony about, I did a little better 
9 job attaching them. And just so for the grand jury 
10 to understand what I've done here, I have three 
11 boards and each board represents a vantage point. 
12 So the actual vantage point, the picture of that 
13 vantage point is on the back of the board. 
14 So as you see here on the back of 
15 this board, there 1s a cone in the middle of the 
16 street. That would be where the police vehicle was. 
17 And so when you then look at the pictures that are 
18 on front of the board, and you've heard Detective 
19 testify about how the photographer stood 1n 
20 that location over that cone, actually stood, 
21 straddled the cone and would take pictures moving 
22 clockwise 360, so that we would have an idea of what 
23 can be seen from that vantage point to help you 
24 figure out where people were, what they might have 
25 seen, parts of it they might have seen. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 28 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 And actually, when I prepared these 
2 boards, I did it us1ng what's called removable tape 
3 because I wanted y'all to be able to take these 
4 pictures off if you needed to or move them around if 
5 you needed to. But unfortunately, removable tape 
6 doesn't stay very well and the next day I came 1n 
7 and these pictures were like all on the floor. 
8 As you see they're coming off 
9 somewhat and so I've provided a tape dispenser for 
10 you. If you see that, see how this is coming off 
11 here. This is because this tape doesn't stick well. 
12 I'm taking these down so they stay. 
13 You should be able to pull them off. If there is a 
14 need to remove them and move them around 1n any way. 
15 But I believe we finished up with 
16 this board which I did not mark last week, but I'm 
17 going to mark now. 
18 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 104 
19 marked for identification.) 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody have, before 
21 anybody I move onto the next board, we kind of 
22 finished with the last picture. Anybody have any 
23 other questions about this board? 
24 And just so you all know too, you will see 
25 that there are, I think, five easels in this room 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 29 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 right now. There 1s one 1n the corner that's 
2 holding that flip chart, one that's in this corner. 
3 The one I just put up there, there's another one in 
4 the corner and one over here. 
5 So when it 1s time for you to deliberate, 
6 if you feel like you want to get all of these out 
7 and put them up, it is just hard for me to move 
8 around by doing it right now. 
9 I'm just go1ng to do them one at a time. 
10 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 105 
11 marked for identification.) 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Next board I'm going to 
13 mark Grand Jury Exhibit 105. 
14 Again, I put the picture on the back of 
15 the board that shows the vantage point of these 
16 pictures. You see a cone in that picture, and 
17 Detective looking at the photos on the front 
18 of the board. Can you tell what vantage point that 
19 is? 
20 A This would be the far eastern point that 
21 we took, the 360 degree photos from. 
22 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And why 1s it that this 
23 cone was placed at that location on Canfield Drive 
24 or Canfield Road? 
25 A As best we could tell based off of witness 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 30 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 accounts, that would have been the furthest point 
2 east that Michael Brown would have went to. So that 
3 intersection of roughly Coppercreek Court and 
4 Canfield Drive. 
5 Q If you want to point to where that 1s on 
6 your other map? 
7 A So essentially the western corner, or what 
8 would be the northwestern corner, I should say, of 
9 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive is where this 
10 cone was placed roughly right about there. 
11 (indicating) 
12 Q And so we see 1n the photograph that is on 
13 the back of this board, the cone there, did the 
14 photographer straddle that cone and take 360 
15 photographs in the same manner that she did from the 
16 vantage point from where the police vehicle had 
17 been? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Same procedure was used, yes. 
Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Is this from the 
21 perspective, you said from the farthest point that 
22 the Michael Brown got to, is this the point where he 
23 stopped in the roadway and turned? 
24 A Yes, ma'am. We are basing that off of 
25 witness statements as best we could tell. That was 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 31 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the point that they had made reference to and so we 
2 used that as the furthest eastern point to go to. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, I'm go1ng to put 
3 
4 
5 this up, Detective. If you want to come up here if 
6 it is easier for you to see. We're go1ng to start 
7 with the top left-hand photo is the first photo 1n 
8 the group and then we're going to move left to 
9 right, and then down to the second row left to right 
10 and then down to the third row left to right. 
11 So the first photograph, can you 
12 describe for the grand jurors where the photograph, 
13 what the photographer is seeing in that image? 
14 A This photograph right here would be, 
15 aga1n, if I move to this map at the intersection of 
16 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive, the 
17 photographer would have been taking a photo that 
18 would have been essentially almost due east. So 
19 taking a photograph due east. 
20 Q And so 1n that photograph, can you see 
21 Building Number 
22 A There would be Building Number and a 
23 portion of Building Number 
24 Q Can you put the laser pointer on Building 
25 Number 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 32 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A This would be Building Number right 
2 here. And then if we move to our left that would be 
3 Building Number 
4 
5 
Q 
of the 
Now, from this perspective, the location 
would, if they were, 
6 according to their statements, can you see where 
7 they would have been? 
8 A They discussed being near, essentially 
9 this area right here, the corner of this building 
10 somewhere in this area right here. (indicating) 
11 Q And there's a dumpster that you can see 1n 
12 that photograph; is that right? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q Okay. And then also there was a witness 
15 1n Building Number 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
And who was that? 
Q We can see Building Number 
first photograph? 
A Correct. 
from this 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q And then there were also possibly two 
23 witnesses that were near this dumpster? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And that would be? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 33 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A 
Q All right. 
and 
Is that the dumpster that 
3 appears in the top left-hand side of that first 
4 photograph? 
5 A Yes, ma'am. 
6 
7 
8 
Q Okay. Now, mov1ng onto, well, let me ask 
you this. Building 
and 
which would have been where 
would have been, can 
9 you see Building 1n this, 1n that first 
10 photograph? 
11 A Yes, it looks like you can see a portion 
12 
13 
of Building over here. 
Q Okay. So depending on the angle of that 
14 photograph and where they would have been, it's 
15 possible that someone from Building could see 
16 where the photographer was standing? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then the next photo, 1s this mov1ng 
19 clockwise or counter clockwise? 
20 A This next photo would be counter 
21 clockwise. 
22 Q Yeah, did I put these up wrong? 
23 A I think these two are transposed. 
24 Q Good thing I used removable tape, huh. 
25 All right. Tell you what, let's take a pause as we 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 34 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 try to get this right. 
2 (Recess) 
3 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So we've discovered that 
4 I have some photographs in the wrong order and we're 
5 going to move on to the next board so that I can 
6 during maybe a break we can rearrange those 
7 photographs and put them up the way they should be 
8 and we will revisit that after a break. 
9 So the next board is going to be 
10 marked Grand Jury Exhibit 106. 
11 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 106 
12 marked for identification.) 
13 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Detective, looking at 
14 the photograph on the back of that board, can you 
15 tell me where the photographer is standing for these 
16 photographs? 
17 A This would be at the point where Michael 
18 Brown's body was located when we arrived at the 
19 scene. 
20 Q All right. Before we start, can you look 
21 at that real quickly and tell me did I get that 
22 right or is that wrong too? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: This lS what happens when 
24 you do live theater. 
25 A The top is clockwise. This one 1s 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 35 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 clockwise. This 1s clockwise, we're good. 
2 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Is this supposed to be 
3 there? 
4 A That's correct. 
5 Q All right, good. So looking at these 
6 photographs starting at the top left. And what 
7 direction is the photographer facing? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Primarily west. 
And that would be on Canfield Drive? 
That's correct. 
And from that first photograph, 1s she 
12 straddling the cone that appears in the photograph 
13 on the back of the exhibit? 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And so from this location, can you 
14 
15 
16 see the location where would have 
17 been? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
You can. 
And where 1s that? 
It would be at this point right here. 
And in the photograph you can see kind of 
22 the corner of a white house or structure? 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
That's correct. 
Is that the house where he was? 
That is the house where he was working. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 36 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: I have a question about 
2 You mentioned, I guess, when we 
3 were here Thursday that you talked to the homeowner? 
4 A I talked to the individual who resides at 
5 that home and I also talked to the homeowner, yes. 
6 GRAND JUROR: And they said, what was 
7 their response to him being there? 
8 A Neither one could remember exact dates, 
9 but it was around that time they did both confirm 
10 that there was work being done on the home around 
11 that time and they both confirmed that there was an 
12 individual there. They didn't know names, there was 
13 an individual there that was doing some sort of 
14 drywall and painting work at the house. 
15 GRAND JUROR: I kind of find that a little 
16 strange because when he sat down with us, he told us 
17 that he specifically told whoever was at that house 
18 what had happened? 
19 A I asked her about that, and she said that 
20 she remembered talking to him briefly, didn't 
21 remember what they had talked about and that she 
22 ultimately left for work. 
23 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Let me ask you this, 
24 given that you actually have been to that residence, 
25 did you make any attempts for yourself to stand in 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 37 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the location where you believe stood 
2 and look down Canfield to see for yourself what 
3 someone in that position might be able to see? 
4 
5 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And from where, from your observation, 
6 would a person standing at the location where 
7 said he was, could they see where the 
8 police vehicle was? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
They could. 
And could they see where the farthest 
11 easterly point where Michael Brown, witnesses say he 
12 may have stopped and turned around? 
13 A Yes, he could. 
14 Q Could you also see the place where Michael 
15 Brown's body came to rest? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Are there any obstructions between where 
18 from your observation from that vantage point to any 
19 of those locations is there any obstructions that 
20 would be in your way? 
21 A The only obstruction would have been the 
22 trunk of this tree right here. I don't know if 
23 everyone can see that. There is a tree right there 
24 and the trunk of that tree would have been the only 
25 obstruction. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 38 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: How big lS that trunk, how 
2 wide? 
3 A I don't know specifically, but clearly the 
4 only reason I mention that is in the interest of 
5 full disclosure, that's the only 
6 GRAND JUROR: According to your judgment, 
7 it 1s not a big, wide tree? 
8 
9 
10 
A 
A 
No, it 1s a grown 
GRAND JUROR: Full grown tree? 
It 1s clearly a grown tree, but 1n the 
11 grand scheme of looking at a particular incident, 
12 one tree that is at a distance, I didn't view it as 
13 something that would have impeded my ability to see 
14 the entire incident. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
GRAND JUROR: Thank you, Slr. 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: 
was standing, 
From his distance where he 
could he actually see 
19 the movements, you can see a person standing, but 
20 could you actually physically see the movements of 
21 Michael Brown? 
22 A So just by chance when myself and another 
23 detective were at this home right here, there was 
24 quite a few people walking around 1n this general 
25 area and up to and including someone walking what 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 39 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 would be roughly, aga1n, at the intersection of 
2 Coppercreek Court and Canfield Court. And you can 
3 clearly see that individual and I could clearly see 
4 that individual and I could see hands moving and I 
5 could see where they were moving their hands if 
6 walking like this, I would be able to see the 
7 movement of their hands, yes. (indicating) 
8 GRAND JUROR: Could see their facial 
9 expressions? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
A 
A 
I don't remember. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
I don't remember. 
GRAND JUROR: All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions? 
GRAND JUROR: How soon after the incident 
16 were these photos taken? 
17 A I don't, I could check for you and get you 
18 an exact date. 
19 
20 
21 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
But I don't remember. 
MS. ALIZADEH: The dates the photos were 
22 taking, is that what was asked? 
23 
24 
GRAND JUROR: Right uh-huh. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm guessing that might be, 
25 you know what, it might be the date they were

I do. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) He brought that so he 
5 could answer questions if there were questions like 
6 this.

12 
A 
GRAND JUROR: The 1st? 
The 1st of October, yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: Could I make another 
13 comment? Conceivably the abundance of foliage 
14 during that course of time from August until October 
15 when the photos were taken, so there may not have 
16 been as much foliage? I know you are not a 
17 botanist, I understand that. 
18 A That was a consideration that we took, we 
19 took that into consideration in doing those photos. 
20 We wanted to get it, obviously, before the leaves 
21 started to change. If you look 1n these photos 
22 here. The foliage is still green. I'm not saying 
23 that, obviously, there are leaves in these photos 
24 right here, but the foliage is clearly green at that 
25 point when photos were taken.

3 also looking at this first image, if there were

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
What number would that be? 
That would be Building 
What witnesses were ln Building Number 
And in Building would have been 
Okay. And so if they were on the front of 
12 their building and looking toward the photographer, 
13 who is standing 1n this grouping, this is where 
14 Michael Brown's body was; is that correct? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
They would be able to see Michael Brown's 
17 body 1n the street? 
18

10 the western side of this stairwell right here, but 
11 this balcony right here is connected and there 1s 
12 obviously a balcony on this side that you cannot see 
13 that would be consistent with this one on the 
14 eastern end. 
15 Q We talked about the fact that there is, 
16 there's a balcony that's connected on the fronts of 
17 these buildings, but there's a wall that will at 
18 some point block somebody's vision depending upon 
19 where they are on their balconies and what they are 
20 looking at, is that fair to say? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
That's fair to say. 
So depending on where somebody 1s on these 
23 balconies would depend on whether or not they could 
24 see something in the street? 
25 A Right.

15 which is basically slightly below street level, 
16 correct? 
? 
17 A Correct. As a frame of reference, I would 
18 say roughly about that high below street level. 
19 Q So if he were on his patio right outside 
20 his front door street level would be about three a 
21 and a half, 4 feet? 
22 A Roughly. 
23 Q And then clockwise, aga1n, looking at 
24 Photograph Number 7, I think? 
25 A We're looking at the same building, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 47 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014

8 then in the far right-hand side of the photograph we 
9 can see building, a portion of Building 
10 Q All right. Would this parking lot that we 
11 see here, I'm not sure on this, thinking from my
