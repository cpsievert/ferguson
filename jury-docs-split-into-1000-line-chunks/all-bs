It was facing towards me. 
So it was facing West Florissant? 
Yes. 
And was the car, police vehicle moving 
still when you saw it? 
It was still, it was at a slight slant. 
Okay. And so what then did you see 
or 
14 A I seen Mike Brown was leaned over inside 
15 the police officer's window. I didn't see 
16 Mr. Johnson at any moment during this time.

1 took place for seconds, I'm not sure how long. I 
2 know that it appeared that some confrontation was 
3 taking place. 
4 And one shot, the first shot was let 
5 loose and after the first shot, Mike Brown came out 
6 of the window and took off running. 
7 With that happening, I thought 
8 instantly because the police officer didn't 
9 immediately react on how I would have thought it 
10 would have went down. Where he didn't immediately 
11 get out of his car and chase after Mike Brown. 
12 So my initial thought was that wow, 
13 did I just witness this young guy kill a police 
14 officer. 
15 So after that, Mike Brown ran some 
16 distance, the police officer exited his vehicle with

right here, but he 
was already in pursuit of 
22 him. He stopped. He did turn, he did some sort of 
23 body gesture, I'm not sure what it was, but I know 
24 it was a body gesture. And I could say for sure he 
25 never put his hands up after he did his body

1 gesture, he ran towards the officer full charge. 
2 The officer fired several shots at 
3 him and to give an estimate, I would say roughly 
4 around five to six shots was fired at Mike Brown. 
5 Mike Brown was still coming towards 
6 the officer and at this point I'm thinking, wow, is 
7 this officer missing Mike Brown at this close of a 
8 range. 
9 Mike Brown continuously came forward 
10 in the charging motion and at some point, at one 
11 point he started to slow down and he came to a stop. 
12 And when he stopped, that's when the officer ceased 
13 fire and when he ceased fired, Mike Brown started to 
14 charge once more at him. When he charged once more, 
15 the officer returned fire with, I would say, give an 
16 estimate of three to four shots. And that's when 
17 Mike Brown finally collapsed right about even with 
18 this driveway. (indicating) 
19 And during this whole time there was 
20 a blue Monte Carlo parked almost right where that 
21 car is while this altercation was taking place. 
22 And the car drove around and stopped 
23 right here and when Mike Brown collapsed in the 
24 street, that's when his friend came out, I don't 
25 know out of what direction he came from. All I know

1 is I seen him run across from in front of the squad 
2 car and he ran across and he stopped like evenly 
3 with the car that was parked right here and yelled, 
4 "he just killed him, he just killed him." 
5 I'm not sure if he was speaking with

16 confrontation taking place in the vehicle. I 
17 couldn't make it out, I couldn't say who did what 
18 within that time span within that vehicle. All I 
19 know is that it just looked out of the norm with 
20 somebody being leaned over inside the police

19 officer exited his vehicle and within that time I 
20 would say the officer maybe was here when Mike Brown 
21 stopped there.

21 I wrestle with to this day, I'm not sure. I'm not 
22 sure if he knew the people that was in that car and 
23 he thought maybe he had time to go back to wrestle 
24 with this officer. To this day, why would he turn 
25 around and not give himself up.

3 need to stand up to demonstrate, you can do that

5 A I can't say for sure what sort of body 
6 gesture, I cannot recall fully. All I know is it 
7 was not in a surrendering motion of I'm 
8 surrendering, putting my hands up or anything, I'm 
9 not sure. If it was like a shoulder shrug or him 
10 pulling his pants up, I'm not sure. I really don't

All right. And so as you then see Mike 
12 Brown begin to charge at the officer, how far does 
13 he get before you said the officer fires a number of 
14 shots? 
15 A The officer is right here. I would say 
16 Mike Brown gets to right there, even with the car 
17 before the officer starts to fire. 
18 Q Okay. And just for the record, when you 
19 say even with the car, we are talking about the car 
20 that's on this map? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
That's in the map, it is just a random 
23 vehicle that happen to be on that street when they 
24 took this picture, correct?

6 range? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q So when you heard those five or six shots, 
9 did you see any blood on Mike Brown that you could 
10 see? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
No. 
Did you see him react in any way that 
13 might make you think that he was hit, like, you 
14 know, flinching or anything? 
15 A It was more kind of a flinch, yes. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 A It was more of a flinch and, urn, with my 
18 thoughts of, I thought he was missing him because me

1 still at a charge? 
2 A He gradually slowed his pace. And it 
3 became, it came to a stop and when he stopped, the 
4 officer ceased fire and he began to charge once 
5 more, and that's when the officer with fatal rounds. 
6 Q So when he became, when he stopped, about 
7 how many seconds or fraction of seconds do you think 
8 it was before he began to charge again? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
I would give it maybe two seconds. 
Okay. And then how far did you get on 
11 that, after stopping and then he's charging again, 
12 how far did he get about, if you can estimate feet, 
13 that's fine, or if you want to say how many steps he
