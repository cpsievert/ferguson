Q 
Yes. 
Now he's already got to the point where 
18 he's shot him and a fatal injury has him on the 
19 ground. So now he backtracks a little bit and says 
20 when he was chasing him? 
21 A When he was chasing and I'm sorry, I'm 
22 explain that a little better. He knows there are a 
23 lot of people around once Michael Brown was on the 
24 ground. He said while he was chasing him, this is 
25 all within a matter of seconds, he didn't notice

1 anybody else. Once Michael Brown went to down to 
2 the ground, he saw a lot of people in the community, 
3 an apartment complex around. 
4 He said Officer was the first 
5 one on the scene. And he had, Officer Wilson had 
6 Officer secure the scene or block the 
7 street. 
8 Wilson called for an ambulance. The 
9 next two arrivals were Ferguson Police Department 
10 Officer and at the time because there was 
11 really, West Florissant to get onto Canfield is the 
12 only way to connect to a major roadway, both were 
13 west of the scene. So Officer Wilson had Officer 
14 move his vehicle to the east side so they 
15 could block that, so they could secure the scene, 
16 maintain some scene control. 
17 Q To block vehicular traffic that might be 
18 coming westbound on Canfield? 
19 A Yes. Officer Wilson described feeling 
20 unsafe standing next to Brown's body since he was 
21 the shooter. He thought, the area is known for 
22 violence, guns, gangs and drugs. They did not have 
23 a good relationship with the police. He kind of 
24 felt he really had a spotlight on him. 
25 He walked towards his vehicle which

So he reached in to turn the car off? 
And grabbed the keys. 
And take the keys out of the vehicle? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then he shut the door? 
Yes, ma'am. 
He didn't get in the car? 
He did not. 
All right. 
I don't know if other officers arrived, 
I'm sorry, the Ferguson Sergeant responded. 
Wilson told Sergeant that he had killed Brown. 
16 He quoted himself as saying, "he grabbed my gun and 
17 I shot him." 
18 told him to go, told Wilson to 
19 go sit in Wilson's car. And Wilson said, no, 
20 because then everyone will know it was me because 
21 everyone around him is working and he's not. 
22 So Officer, I'm sorry, Sergeant 
23 told him to go back to the station, to not take

Wilson's vehicle. Sergeant had to let him take

And Wilson described that he thought 
that it was strange that Sergeant wouldn't have 
3 another Ferguson police officer go back with him 
4 because he was just involved in a shooting, that 
5 even minutes after the scene a lot of people showed 
6 up. I think he described it the police officers 
7 being outnumbered 300 to 1. 
8 So he drove back to the station, he 
9 noticed that his handheld radio was on channel 3 
10 instead of channel 1. Channel 1 was the Ferguson 
11 dispatch and channel 3 was St. Louis County Police 
12 Department Dispatch. He wasn't even sure, while he 
13 could hear St. Louis County, he wasn't sure if he 
14 keyed up that they would hear him whatever he said. 
15 He believes that the radio switch 
16 during the struggle in the car, but he's not 
17 positive, actually, because he's not usually on 
18 channel 3, excuse me, not channel 3. 
19 When Wilson got back to the station 
20 he washed the blood off of his hands. His primary 
21 concern was not of evidence, but as a biohazard or 
22 what possible blood hazards it might attract. 
23 So no one at the station photographed 
24 Officer Wilson's hands because there was no one 
25 there to photograph them.

1 Right after he washed his hands he 
2 went to the roll call room, he made his gun safe, 
3 which means he took out any bullet and packaged it 
4 as evidence, that's how he described it to us. 
5 He did not wait for somebody else to 
6 bag that as evidence because he saw blood on the 
7 gun, thought it was Brown's blood, wanted to 
8 preserve the DNA. He didn't want to risk because he 
9 believed that would prove that he had his hand on 
10 the gun.

Wilson knew that was the attorney to call 
22 if he was ever involved in a shooting.

10 comment on what happened. 
11 After the Attorney arrived, 
12 St. Louis County Police Department Detective 
13 and Lieutenant Colonel also came to 
14 speak with Wilson. 
15 Between and 
16 Wilson, they noticed Wilson's face was red and 
17 swollen, so they collectively decided they were 
18 going to take him to the hospital. They took him to 
19 Christian Northwest emergency room. Shortly before 
20 they took him there, Wilson described Detective

22 continued it after they got to the emergency room.

1 one had ever before attempted to take his firearm. 
2 Officer Wilson had been trained to 
3 use physical force when a physical threat was 
4 present. 
5 Michael Brown became an immediate 
6 threat to Wilson's safety when Michael Brown came 
7 into the car, when Michael Brown hit Officer Wilson. 
8 Michael Brown went for Officer 
9 Wilson's firearm and Michael Brown charged towards 
10 Officer Wilson after Brown had already run away. 
11 Michael Brown was a threat to the 
12 safety of others as he ran away from Officer Wilson.

19 saying was what was relayed to me by Mr. Wilson. In 
20 no way, shape or form am I offering any opinion 
21 whatsoever.

23 of the statement? 
24 A Yes. The last thing was it is the

1 report. It is Wilson's responsibility to write an 
2 incident report, but as of August 28th, 2014, 
3 Officer Wilson had not been back to the station, so 
4 he has not had the opportunity to write an incident 
5 report. 
6 Q So he's basically told you that after the 
7 shooting and contacting, having contact with 
8 Sergeant he goes directly to the Ferguson 
9 Police Department, can't talk to anybody about this 
10 until possibly his attorney arrives and then 
11 ? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And he also tells you that no one had 
14 possession of his gun from the time he left the 
15 scene until he made it safe and packaged it in that 
16 envelope? 
17 
18 
A 
Q

19 should use notes, did he tell you that he had 
20 sustained any other injuries to the backs of his 
21 hands or on his hands?

3 far after the incident. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, do you have any 
5 additional? 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: I do. 
7 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So he, on August the 9th 
8 this occurred and you didn't interview him until 
9 August 28th? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
However, he told you that he saw the 
12 Cigarillos in Michael Brown's hand at some point? 
13 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
At what point was that? 
That was, initially when he made contact 
16 with both Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown, his 
17 attention was drawn to Dorian Johnson because Dorian 
18 was first and also responded to his, hey, can you 
19 guys use the sidewalk, or whatever verbiage he had 
20 used. 
21 When he said what's wrong with the 
22 sidewalk, his attention was then turned towards 
23 Michael Brown because Michael Brown responded to 
24 him, "fuck what you have to say," or excuse me, I'm 
25 sorry, yes, that's what he said. Once Michael Brown

1 said that, his attention was drawn, Officer Wilson's 
2 attention was drawn to Michael Brown, at which time 
3 he then saw the Cigarillos that Michael Brown was 
4 holding. 
5 Q All right. So he saw the Cigarillos 
6 before any physical altercation, right?

Q 
Before attempting to arrest. 
Did he say why, I guess that changed, 
22 because what happened to change that, did he say?

24 stall, try to have a conversation with them in a 
25 sense, well, at least he was not going to ask them

1 about the robbery. I don't necessarily, forgive me, 
2 I don't think he said arrest, he just said before he 
3 even mentioned anything about the stealing in 
4 progress, he was going to wait for other officers to 
5 get there. 
6 Q Okay. So did he, so he said he knew about 
7 the stealing in progress because of the Cigarillos. 
8 He was not going to mention the stealing in 
9 progress, he was just going to stall them? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
Did he talk to you about what he went out 
12 on his radio to say that he was doing a check with 
13 two people, to send him a car? 
A Yes. 14 
15 Q Did he say that he told the dispatcher 
16 hey, I've got two guys involved in this stealing at 
17 this Ferguson Market and I see one with Cigarillos? 
18 A Right, no, he did not say that. He 
19 specially mentioned the fact he doesn't often asked 
20 for assistance on calls, so when people hear him 
21 over the radio saying, send me more cars, they know 
22 he needs another car. 
23 Why he didn't mention the stealing 
24 would be my conjecture. 
25 Q But let me say he didn't?

call?

11 Michael Brown was running away, was not an immediate 
12 threat?

14 
A 
Q 
To him. 
To him. Did he say why he thought Michael 
15 Brown would continue to run? I think that's what 
16 you said that he knew he would continue to run? 
17 A That was based on his training and 
18 experience that he believed Michael Brown starting 
19 to run away, and based off his training and 
20 experience he believed Michael Brown was going to 
21 continue running versus stop and turn around. 
22 Q And did that factor into his thought 
23 pattern, did he say? Did you understand what that 
24 meant? 
25 A In that limited perspective, yes. But

1 again, I also am trained in law enforcement, so I 
2 understand. So to go further to explain why he may 
3 have thought that would be putting my personal 
4 understanding, not using, putting words into his 
5 mouth. 
6 Q Okay. And you certainly cannot speak for 
7 that officer and we don't want you to. 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes. 
But tell me what you mean by your personal 
10 experience as a law enforcement officer? 
11 A Someone running who runs away, who as he 
12 described it, attempted to assault him. And then 
13 was not going to and had not yet complied, would 
14 likely not, but you would still be prepared at this 
15 point for whatever happens. 
16 Q So when Michael Brown said something like, 
17 "fuck what you say," or something, did he say that 
18 that was a comment that required him to confront him 
19 about it?

21

Q 
22 backed up? 
23

He reversed the vehicle. 
That was strictly about confronting about

13 received a letter of accommodation for handling a 
14 call when he was an officer with Jennings Police 
15 Department. 
Q Anything else? 16 
17 A There was, there were, he did have use of 
18 force reports, but that's standard practice. I 
19 didn't see anything out of the ordinary. There was 
20 a complaint made against him and two other officers 
21 describing that was ultimately found to be 
22 unfounded, to describe Officer Wilson and two others 
23 attacks, an African-American male who was just

2 What was found to have actually 
3 happened was this gentleman was breaking in and was 
4 inside Officer Wilson's car. The three officers who 
5 were off duty at the time went outside and tried to 
6 detain him, he ran away. 
7 When they chased him, I don't know 
8 which one of them tackled him on the ground, he hit 
9 his face on the way down. 
10 This was an internal affairs

12 they discussed with the hospital that the 
13 individual, the person who was either the victim of

1 if we could, you mentioned that Darren in reference 
2 to this neighborhood said it is an area known for 
3 gangs, violence, guns and he didn't feel safe. And 
4 I think that really, I don't know, is alarming to 
5 hear. So how would you kind of say that fit into 
6 the case or was there more depth to it when he said 
7 that. 
8 A It had to do with, I guess the atmosphere. 
9 He described that when almost immediately after, 
10 he's not sure when it happened, but once Michael 
11 Brown was down on the ground, the residents were 
12 outside. He said, and the crowd kept growing 
13 increasingly hostile because he knows from being a 
14 police officer in that area, people generally don't 
15 like to see the police. 
16 So based on the fact of what just 
17 happened, he did not feel safe. Whether it means 
18 by, it would be my conjecture and I can't do that. 
19 Is there 
20 any part of Officer Wilson's testimony or statement 
21 that you believe is in conflict with any of the 
22 physical evidence you are aware of? 
23 A I don't, I cannot make that judgment. My 
24 sole purpose is simply to collect the facts. It is 
25 up to the prosecuting attorneys and any future jury

2 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask you a question, 
3 though, prior to you questioning Darren Wilson, to 
4 your knowledge had he read any police reports 
5 documenting the investigation? 
6 A Not to my knowledge, no. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Have any reports, first of 
8 all if he has, I haven't gotten any reports, so I 
9 don't know where anybody else would have them. To 
10 your knowledge, he had no knowledge of the 
11 investigation? 
A Correct. 12 
13 
14 
MS. ALIZADEH: And then regarding autopsy 
reports, to your knowledge, Dr. who was 
15 the medical examiner in this case, he had not read 
16 that report; is that correct? 
17 A No, he had not. If Officer Wilson knew 
18 anything about the case, it is the same thing anyone 
19 who heard in the news what was ever released to the 
20 news is what he would know. Ferguson Police 
21 Department is not doing an investigation, that was 
22 turned immediately over, the homicide investigation 
23 was turned immediately over to St. Louis County. 
24 As far as civil rights is concerned, 
25 FBI is notoriously tight lipped. So, no, we would

1 not give him any information. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We can ask him when he 
3 testifies what he may have learned or whatever or 
4 what have. Are you aware that there is all kind of 
5 rumors and talk about various things involving what 
6 people believe happened in this case, correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And to your knowledge though, as far as 
9 the physical evidence like where the shell casings 
10 were or where blood was found or any of that type of 
11 evidence, he wouldn't have privy to? 
12 A No, he would not be privy to, other than 
13 being actually on the scene, but no, no reports. 
14 When 
15 you first, when he said he got to the police 
16 station, he washed his hands and he didn't have 
17 anybody take pictures because there was nobody else 
18 there. But then later he said that he saw 
19 
20 
21 
a police officer, so was 
there. Was the only officer that was there? 
A At that time, I think the way I 
22 interpreted his statement to us is he gets to the 
23 station, no one is there that he sees immediately. 
24 I don't believe he went searching, he didn't say he 
25 went searching, but he has blood on his hands. His

8 Your interview with him 
9 was on 8/28? 
10 A It was. 
11 The incident took place 
12 on 8/9? 
13 A It did. 
14 Was there a reason why

17 after or three days after it took place?

21 that you demonstrated from, just to describe for the 
22 court reporter. He said head down. At what angle,

2 MS. WHIRLEY: 
3 I'm just hoping that I 
4 have written this down correctly. But I believe you 
5 had mentioned that Officer Wilson, Darren Wilson 
6 said he went to his vehicle, which was still

8 the first I heard of that.

He pulled the keys out of the car. 
It was still running? 
Yes, that's the impression that I got that 
12 the car is in park, I'm assuming because the car 
13 would have been rolling away if he didn't at least 
14 put it in park.

17 the keys out of the car.
