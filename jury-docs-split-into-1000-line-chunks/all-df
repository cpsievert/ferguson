A No, ma'am. 
Never. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Do you know if anyone was 
12 asked to fingerprint the gun, is this something you 
13 would know? 
14 A I don't know off the stop of my head. I 
15 would think that they would bring it to -- since 
16 they brought the gun belt and everything down, I 
17 think they would bring the gun to me, but I don't 
18 know that. 
19 Just to comment 
20 on a question for you, but I do remember that they 
21 specifically went the DNA route.

MS. WHIRLEY: Anyone else? 
Kathi, since you don't know what we've 
24 covered. I don't know if you have any additional

MS. ALIZADEH: This October 7th at 
6 3:21 p.m. I'm present, as well as Sheila Whirley, 
7 and 12 grand jurors are present, as well as 
8 the court reporter. And we've had a little break 
9 and I just want to put on the record that during the 
10 break there was some discussion, but it was 
11 primarily about logistics and scheduling and 
12 planning. There was really nothing discussed that 
13 had to do with any substance of the case and the 
14 evidence that has been presented. 
15 Would you all agree with that, we didn't 
16 talk about the evidence? 
17 (All indicate yes.) 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So for now we are going to 
19 resume this afternoon and we would first start off 
20 by playing a statement by a witness named 
21 I expect that she will be here a little 
22 later this afternoon. And this is a statement that 
23 made to County Police officers on August 13th, 
24 and the statement is recorded and contained on Grand 
25 Jury Exhibit Number 24.

12 anybody need to hear that or a portion of it over 
13 again? I really, as you all notice it was, I would 
14 say poor quality recording. Difficult to hear at

17 review that again, you have difficulty hearing that,
