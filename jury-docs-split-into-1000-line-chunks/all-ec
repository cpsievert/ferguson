6 talking about pictures of Jesus on the wall and 
7 different things. 
8 Q Okay. Did Mike, and we know who we are 
9 talking about Mike Brown, the young man that was 
10 killed. Did he appear to you to be in an agitated 
11 mood or aggressive, or anything like that? 
12 A He flinched his fist a couple times and 
13 looked up at the sky when they were over here 
14 talking, I came around to see what's going on, he 
15 flinched his fist a couple times and like looking 
16 up. I kind of found it odd. 
17 You know, take a step back whenever 
18 we were over here in this conversation, they were 
19 talking about the socks, and Mike said, you know, 
20 you've got to try everything in this life, you know, 
21 everything to figure out where you want to go in 
22 this world. And that kind of led me to believe he 
23 is probably high.

A It was them talking about pictures of 
Jesus on the wall and said something to the 
7 effect of how you might have a picture of Jesus on 
8 your wall, well, the devil has got a picture of me 
9 on his wall. Whenever I come down, he's going to be 
10 the person in charge. he's a character. I 
11 don't know if you guys have seen him. 
12 At the end of the conversation when 
13 it was all said and done, Mike said, you know, nice 
14 talking to you, and he shook hand. I could

The socks. 
Oh, the socks, okay. He said nothing was 
9 wrong with smoking? 
10 A I was up there for four weeks and it was a 
11 day-to-day thing I smelled marijuana a lot around 
12 all of the apartment buildings. Don't get me wrong, 
13 you know, I don't want to stereotype anybody, but a 
14 guy with marijuana leafs on his socks is probably 
15 smoking marijuana. 
16 Q I was curious about whether you thought he 
17 appeared high though that morning when you saw him, 
18 and that's why I was asking a few detailed questions 
19 about it. There was nothing that made him appear 
20 high except for the socks? 
21 A Right. And the fact that he came down 
22 asking if one of us were mad, you know, kind of 
23 paranoid, you know.

1 Q Later at some point you came from behind 
2 that building and could see him on the ground? 
3 A After it all happened, we walked up to 
4 this knoll right about here and that's when they 
5 were taping it off and everything. 
6 Q Could you see the officer when he hit the 
7 ground, from your vantage point? 
8 A Where this car is at, I mean, they were 
9 about 10 feet apart. And the officer kind of backed 
10 up. He might have been standing right here at this 
11 corner, the officer and I didn't see the final part 
12 of that so. 
13 Q Could you tell, and maybe you just told 
14 us. I'm going to ask to make sure, could you tell 
15 how far apart Mike Brown and the officer was when 
16 you saw him shoot him six or seven times?
