11 So in that case, 
12 something were obstructing it other than the 
13 stovepiping, you wouldn't have to do this or do this 
14 with the slide to make it fire again. You would 
15 just have to remove whatever was obstructing that 
16 and then fire that without that added step? 
17 A Correct. If you had the hammer obstructed 
18 and it did not fire, this firearm is designed to 
19 function with another pull of the trigger. 
20 So if that obstruction is removed, it 
21 would have then fired. There are firearms that will 
22 only give you one opportunity, one pull of the 
23 trigger. If it didn't fire, then you have to work 
24 that action. This is not that kind of gun. This is 
25 one that if it doesn't fire once, pull the trigger,

4 A Yes. 
5 If it were this type of 
6 situation, you have to do it this way or use your 
7 arm whatever to clear it, but not always. I mean, 
8 only for this situation would you have to do that if 
9 there was something else obstructing it?

If you remove that hand, you're good to 
MS. WHIRLEY: That stovepiping situation, 
5 would you actually lose the cartridge trying to 
6 clear it so that you could fire again? 
7 A Well, if it is a fired cartridge case that 
8 is obstructing the action, you want to lose it, you 
9 want it out of the firearm, so yes. 
10 Q (By Ms. Whirley) If it was feeding and 
11 never fired? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Right, then you have got a live cartridge. 
You want to clear it because it is in that 
14 standing up position, you would lose that cartridge? 
15 A You would lose a live cartridge because it 
16 would automatically, it needs to load the next live 
17 cartridge. So you want to lose that as well. 
18 Q And in this case you did not find any live 
19 cartridges other than the one that was in the 
20 chamber. Is that the other witness? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: That's not how it came to 
22 him. 
23 MS. WHIRLEY: There were 12 cartridges 
24 that were used when the bullet was gone out of this 
25 weapon?

But I have no live cartridges submitted to

MS. WHIRLEY: So there is 12 that were

13 A Correct. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: And so in a stovepiping 
15 situation when you lose a live cartridge, to clear 
16 it to get it to fire the next cartridge. 
17 A Not, there is two different scenarios. If 
18 the fired cartridge case failed to eject and got 
19 trapped. The firearm might not necessarily have 
20 grabbed the next live cartridge to feed it. So in 
21 clearing it, you might not lose a live cartridge. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: But you would have to clear 
23 it? 
24 A Yes, you would have to clear that, but if 
25 you have, the other scenario is if you failed to

1 feed a live cartridge to clear that, you would 
2 definitely lose a live round. Yes. 
3 Does a live 
4 cartridge have the firing pin strike on it so that 
5 it doesn't fire? 
6 A In that scenario it should not 
7 I think not. 
8 A however, bad ammunition would be a 
9 reason a gun might not fire. If it doesn't have a 
10 priming compound or any powder in it because the 
11 manufacturer, you know, the machine skipped that 
12 one, then you very well may have failure to fire. 
13 And it wouldn't be a stovepipe situation, but then 
14 you would still have to work the action to eject 
15 that unfired live cartridge that would have firing 
16 pin impressions, although it is still unfired. 
17 But in a stovepipe situation where a 
18 live cartridge was suspected to have failed to feed 
19 and had to be cleared, I would expect no firing pin 
20 impression. 
21 Obviously, a stovepipe situation with 
22 a fired cartridge case, yes, I would expect a firing 
23 pin impression. 
24 I was trying to figure out 
25 if tried to be fired, it did not strike --

MS. ALIZADEH: Today's date is 
3 October 7th, it is 10:15 a.m. This is Kathi

4 Alizadeh with the prosecutor's office. All 12 grand 
5 jurors are present this morning, as is the court 
6 reporter, , who is taking down the proceedings 
7 and also audio recording the testimony of witnesses. 
8 Sheila Whirley is here and will be in the room in a 
9 minute, but I wanted to just give you an idea of 
10 what we expect to happen today. 
11 We're getting a late start because as 
12 Roseanne Roseannadanna said, it's always something. 
13 So we had some difficulties this morning that we had 
14 to hammer out and we do have two witnesses here this 
15 morning who are going to testify. 
16 And they will, first one is going to be 
17 He's right out here with Sheila. 
18 He's going to be walking in as soon as I give them 
19 the high sign and he'll, after his testimony is 
20 completed, then we will hear from 
21 If you recall, she made a statement that 
22 was recorded that she made to the County Police, we 
23 heard that yesterday. She also made another 
24 statement to the FBI, which we'll play after we're 
25 done just to give you an opportunity to hear that as

2 And so we also have witnesses lined up for 
3 this afternoon. This is just one of those things I 
4 never know if people are going to show up at this 
5 point. People call me and say, I don't think I can 
6 make it now. Well, I call you a cab. So I'm going 
7 to do my best to make good use of your time today. 
8 I've got a couple witnesses who are police 
9 officers or technicians who I've already notified 
10 them to be available if I need to fill a slot if 
11 somebody doesn't show up. So hopefully we'll have 
12 stuff for you for most of the day today, okay. 
13 Does anybody have anything to bring up, 
14 questions before we get started? All right.
