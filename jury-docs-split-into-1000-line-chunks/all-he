19 me, I apologize for having him have to explain to me 
20 once again what he had told me ten minutes earlier.

12 Ferguson. 
13 Q So drove directly to Ferguson?

2 police officers on scene? 
3 A I did. 
4 Q Did observe a number of St. Louis County 
5 uniformed patrolmen on the scene? 
6 A I did. 
7 Q So when you went up there that day, you

17 A Sure. I drove up by myself, however, 
18 other detectives were arriving at the same time in 
19 
20 
their vehicles. I came in off of West Florissant 
and drove east on Canfield. I was unable to drive 
21 even into the apartment complex itself. There was 
22 quite a few cars, police cars and police officers 
23 and then a crowd of individuals who blocked my way. 
24 So I parked, I think it is 3000 block 
25 of Canfield, and walked up to the scene, as did most

6 A That's correct. 
7 Q So the place where you said you had to get 
8 out and walk, can you see it on the map, which is 
9 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 25? 
10 A It would have either been 3027 Canfield or 
11 possibly even beyond 3720 Canfield to the west, so 
12 further off the map. 
13 Q So from when you got out of your car you 
14 walked on foot, where did you go on to? 
15 A I walked up and contacted the other 
16 detectives from my unit who are arriving on the 
17 scene and then we made brief contact with Chief 
18 from Ferguson Police Department who was 
19 already on the scene.
