No, not at all. 
Okay. And so when this came in though, it 
7 was described or it was explained to you that this 
8 was something that they needed to have tested ASAP? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
When you said it was rush, did you mean 
11 rush the test or just that it needed? 
12 A We call them rush cases if it needs to be 
13 worked quickly. 
14 Q Okay. But did you rush the test, in other 
15 words, did you go through the testing process faster 
16 than normal? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
No, I have my own pace. 
Okay. So you have a wait for testing 
19 substances, isn't that fair to say? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
It can be in the normal scheme of things 
22 it could be several weeks or even months before an 
23 evidence item that a police department brings in? 
24 A Yes. We have a backlog so, by meaning 
25 rush, we were putting this case ahead of other cases

15 described the chain of custody that must be 
16 completed on the bottom of the sheet. 
17 So looking at the copy of the 
18 evidence receipt that you had with this evidence 
19 item, can you tell from there where this was seized 
20 from? 
21 A Oh, it says that, well, it says who the 
22 officer is and the department, St. Louis County PD. 
23 Q Okay. The officer who seized the 
24 evidence, does it give his name?

1 Q So in this case had you suspected or had 
2 you noticed on the packaging that there, for 
3 example, that the evidence tape appeared to have 
4 been cut open or that there was something odd about 
5 the way the evidence was packaged that we might

7 noted that in your report? 
8 A I wouldn't note as if, like if there's a 
9 piece of evidence from the officer and then maybe 
10 they had to go back in and reopen somewhere else, 
11 no, I don't note that.

1 it was in a plastic container, a baggy in a plastic 
2 container, I can't remember if you said that in here 
3 or you said that out there when we were talking?

8 sealed plastic container. 
9 Q Okay. And that's how it appeared to you 
10 when you first got it; is that right? 
11 A There would also be the outer container as

I weigh the substance. 
Do you weigh it in the baggy or remove it 
4 from the baggy?

A 
Q 
I remove it from the baggy. 
And so when you weigh it, you weigh it on 
7 a digital scale?

9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And are those scales calibrated on a 
10 regular basis to insure their accuracy? 
11 A They're calibrate once a year, they're 
12 checked weekly. 
13 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
They're checked with certified weights. 
So when you weighed the substance that was 
16 in the baggy, could you remove all the substance in 
17 the baggy, every little leaf and every little--
18 
19 
A 
Q 
As much as I can get out of the bag. 
And according to your report, you had a 
20 weight of 1.589 grams? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Can you describe for me maybe using some 
23 kind of familiar object, is this smaller than a 
24 baseball? 
25 A Yes, a little bit smaller than a baseball.

Grand Jury Volume XI 
October 7, 2014 
Page 95 
2 Q After you weigh the amount of the 
3 marijuana and I see down here in your remarks there 
4 is a remark that you include about uncertainty of 
5 measurement. Do you all see that in the, close to 
6 the bottom? What does that mean, the established 
7 uncertainty of measurement due to balance utilized, 
8 what does that mean? 
9 A We take into consideration any kind of 
10 factor that could make the weight slightly different 
11 than the 1.589. We take into consideration things 
12 such as the readability of the scale, the linearity 
13 of the scale, the stability of the scale, the 
14 sensitivity. 
15 And so what we do is over a course of 
16 time we will analyze, we will take our weights that 
17 we normally have with our certified weights. And we 
18 will record, for example, you have a 1 gram weight 
19 and our scale reads out to 1.000. If you get a one 
20 point 1.001, and during your checking we write down 
21 1.001, then that is documented. 
22 Anything that's different than what 
23 the actual weight is, that's considered, there is a 
24 standard deviation involved. Calculating that and 
25 then you find that we come up with this 1.008 for

Page 96 
1 this balance is the most that that scale would ever 
2 be off. 
3 So basically what we are saying here 
4 with this K factor of three, we're saying that 997 
5 times out of 1,000, this weight here of 1.589 will 
6 be right at 1.589 997 times out of a thousand. 
7 Three of those times it might be 
8 1.589? 
9 
10 
11 
Q 
A 
Q 
And it could be .0008? 
Correct. 
And that's important especially in cases 
12 with marijuana and other drugs when there might be a 
13 criminal legal implication depending on the weight 
14 of the substance? 
15 A I would like to go back about that weight, 
16 just to make sure that we're clear on that. 
17 It's possible that those three out of 
18 the thousand times could be outside the .008. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
I think I did missay that. Basically 
21 statistics are involved, and we're 95 percent 
22 confident that 99.7 percent of this will be within 
23 the .008 of that weight. 
24 Q Okay. And in this case, I mean, you know,

1 circumstances of how much this substance weighed is 
2 really not important or crucial, this isn't a 
3 scenario where we need to have over 35 grams to 
4 charge a certain level of offense. 
5 So let me also ask you, when you 
6 removed the green vegetation from the baggy, did it 
7 appear that it was dry? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
It wasn't wet or moist or sticky? 
Not that I recall. 
And so then after you've waited, what do 
12 you do next? 
13 A Then I perform a microscopic examination 
14 in that we look for characteristic hairs. I look 
15 for cystolith and silicotic hairs.

20 believe that's S-I-L-I-C-0-T-I-C. 
21 Q Okay. What are these things that you are 
22 talking about? 
23 A So cystolith hair, it looks like a bear 
24 claw shape, tiny bear claw shape hair. It is 
25 characteristics to marijuana plants.

1 Q 
Page 98 
Okay. And the other thing that you are 
2 looking for, what is that? 
3 A Silicotic, they are more slender like

5 but knowing that's also on a marijuana plant. It is 
6 not as confirming as a cystolith hair.

A Hair. 
Q But it is not like animal hair or human

A 
Q 
A 
Yeah, I would assume so, yeah. 
Okay, all right, go ahead. 
So basically as it goes over the plant, 
5 gravity takes effect and it will absorb the resinous 
6 material, which is concentrated with the THC that 
7 will go out the exit hole and into a pan. So you 
8 have a nice little surface area there and they let 
9 that evaporate off and then you're left with a very 
10 sticky substance, which that is high THC content. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Which is what the last thing 
12 you said about THC. 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Which has a high THC content. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) That's sticky substance, 
15 is it a combination of the butane and the THC that's 
16 been extracted from the marijuana?

21 THC? 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
At first until butane evaporates off. 
Will the butane evaporate off? 
Yes. 
And so is what your left with almost pure 
I don't know for sure. I haven't done 
23 like a quant on that. 
24 Q But it is higher concentration than it 
25 would be in the plant itself?

A 
Q 
Page 103 
Yes, definitely. 
So if you're going to ingest, you know, 
3 smoke a marijuana joint, if you consume the same 
4 amount in that sticky substance, it would be way 
5 more THC than what was in that joint? 
6 A You have taken the volume of plant 
7 material, let's say, the size of this paper and you 
8 are condensing it down to, you are taking the 
9 cannabinoids and you are condensing it down without 
10 the plant material matrix and all those steps. 
11 Q Okay. This process that you talked about, 
12 is this something like anybody could do if they have 
13 the marijuana and then the right materials? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Sure. 
And then why do people do this process? 
I'm not really sure. 
Okay. If someone, do you know how they 
18 then will consume or ingest the sticky substance 
19 that they've gotten? 
20 A This is pure assumption, but I assume it 
21 is just like marijuana, marijuana is commonly smoked 
22 and marijuana can be ingested. And there are also 
23 those food items that contain marijuana that they 
24 come from Colorado and so forth. 
25 Maybe they're finding ways of using

1 the butane hunting oil to put it in those substances 
2 so it doesn't look like there is plant material in 
3 there. 
4 I've also heard of lollipops that 
5 have THC on them. I would assume it would have to 
6 come from butane hunting oil, not marijuana. They 
7 can't put the marijuana plant in lollipops. 
8 Q So you've heard of people consuming or 
9 ingesting this, you are calling it hunting oil? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Butane hunting oil. 
Butane hunting oil. You have heard of 
12 people ingesting that, correct? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Heard of it. 
If one were to ingest that, you would be 
15 consuming a higher level of THC than you would if 
16 you were to have smoked or ingested the plant 
17 material? 
18 
19 
20 
A Yes, you would. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have anything else. 
MS. WHIRLEY: I don't have anything. 
21 If 
22 someone is containing the substance that you 
23 examined, which was the marijuana, would there be 
24 like some type of detection that you could tell that 
25 they're on marijuana or using marijuana or would

1 there be like a scent or something like coming from 
2 their body, within their skin. You know how you can 
3 tell a person is smoking because it is in their skin 
4 cells, but could you detect that? 
5 A This is getting out of my expertise, but I 
6 have heard that officers are trained to, they know 
7 what the smell of marijuana, I've been around 
8 marijuana. I know the smell of marijuana myself. 
9 As far as what to look for on a 
10 person, I mean, I've heard of like bloodshot eyes, I 
11 haven't heard anything about the skin, there 
12 probably is, there are probably some things out 
13 there. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And just so you all know, 
15 obviously, we've talked about the fact that there is 
16 going to be other witnesses testifying that will at 
17 some point maybe have the expertise to explain this 
18 to you. We're going to have a toxicologist who 
19 testifies about his findings and he'll explain what 
20 that means or what he can tell you about that. 
21 And then there also could be some other 
22 evidence that makes this make sense to you. It is 
23 kind of hard, I can't give you an open statement and 
24 tell you why I was asking these particular 
25 questions, it might not mean anything to you right

2 You 
3 mentioned that the normal procedure that it comes to 
4 an intake person and then goes to the vault and it 
5 would go to you? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Or somebody in your 
8 office, in this instance you said it did not go into 
9 the vault? 
10 
11 
A No, it did not. 
Is that because the rush 
12 was put on it, is that the only reason it didn't go 
13 to the vault or you wouldn't call this miss 
14 handling? 
15 A No, no. Usually when this happens, I hear 
16 this on the intercom that, hey, would somebody, a 
17 drug chemist come up front. So that means the women 
18 who are accepting the evidence up front, there is 
19 being a rush requested and they are trying to assign 
20 it to a drug chemist right then and there instead. 
21 Instead of putting it in 
22 the vault and when you have time to get to it, next 
23 on the list. First come first served. 
24 A Basically they want it done right then a 
25 there.

And on the scale, I just 
2 want some clarification, you said the most it could 
3 be off was 0.008 grams and that's, but then you went 
4 back and you said, that it could be outside of that 
5 amount three times out of a thousand. 
6 A Yes. 
7 You do try to error on 
8 the side of caution, but there is always three out 
9 of a thousand could be incorrect? 
10 A Consider the way this was calculated when 
11 we determine that we were going to put a K factor of 
12 three on it, there's common K factors of two and 
13 three. And two is, would be 99 point, I think it is 
14 maybe 97 percent. I'm not real sure on that but I 
15 do know that K three is higher up, so it is 99.7. 
16 So we're saying statistically we are 
17 95 percent confident that 997 out of a thousand 
18 times that if you were to weigh this substance that 
19 many times it would be within .008 grams of that 
20 actual number we have. 
21 Of the weight that you 
22 have listed here? 
A Yes. 23 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask a question. I 
25 don't know if I was thinking that maybe this is what

1 you were getting at, I neglected to 
2 ask you this, when you looked at this evidence item 
3 that you were testing, can you test marijuana to see 
4 if there's butane on it?
