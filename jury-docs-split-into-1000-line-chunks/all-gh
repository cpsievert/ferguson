Yes. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Would he be able to raise 
up towards his head? 
Yes, but with pain. Now you have a 
clavicle, you have a gunshot wound through 
side of your chest. It is

1 but also that the bullet entered the lobe of right 
2 lung? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q And there was a significant amount of 
5 blood from that, which I imagine you did not see in 
6 your autopsy? 
7 A Of course, that's correct. A lot of these 
8 things that I'm telling you I could not tell from 
9 our autopsy. We actually had to go back and look at 
10 Dr. report and his images. And that's 
11 because, as you can imagine, after the autopsy, all 
12 of these organs have been dissected and they're 
13 dissected again on a second autopsy. And they're 
14 put in a bag and they are in the abdominal cavity 
15 after embalming. 
16 So we basically just have a bag of 
17 organs to look at. We lay them all out, we do our 
18 best, but it can be challenging to interpret gunshot 
19 wounds at that point. 
20 Q If the lung was injured in two different 
21 places at that point, could a person scream loudly? 
22 A Yes, I see no reason why a person couldn't 
23 scream loudly. 
24 Q And the other lung was uninjured by any 
25 gunshots wounds, correct?

A Correct. 1 
2 Q Even a person with one lung can speak, can 
3 yell and scream, correct? 
4 A Correct. 
5 But a 
6 person of that size where only one chest cavity, 
7 might be very short of breath, he might be short of 
8 air. 
9 A To answer your question, yes. That 
10 undoubtedly would make it difficult to breathe with 
11 two gunshots affecting your right chest, 
12 undoubtedly. 
13 You said that 
14 entrance wound and it affected the lung and the rib 
15 was broken? 
16 A Correct. 
17 And it also affected the 
18 clavicle? 
19 A Correct. 
20 So when someone's hurt, I 
21 know when I'm hurt for whatever reason, my instinct 
22 
23 
is to do this? (indicating) 
A Correct. 
24 My instinct when I'm in 
25 pain would not be to do this, not arms up, but that

1 could be misleading. If we were hurt like that, our 
2 instinct would be to bend over? 
3 A I agree, that's possible. 
4 Okay. And he would be 
5 out of breath, so he'd be breathing heavy probably. 
6 A Yes, he would have labored breathing. It 
7 would be difficult to get a good breath at this 
8 point. 
9 With that 
10 same out of breath, he's out of breath, maybe he 
11 can't move as fast? 
12 A Oh, I agree, undoubtedly. These are 
13 definitely, they're not fatal gunshot wounds, but 
14 they are difficult to breathe afterwards. I mean, 
15 having any injury to your right chest like that. 
16 Once a bullet goes through your lung, a lot of 
17 things can start happening physiologically. Your 
18 lungs can shrink down, it can be a real difficult 
19 time to breathe after that. 
20 You could still run or 
21 walk? 
22 A You have a lot of reserves, especially in 
23 a certain situation like this and you have a lot of 
24 adrenaline going, you will be surprised what you can 
25 do after you receive a gunshot wound.

2 run, talk, and do all of that despite having injury 
3 to his right chest. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.

16 better appreciation of all the abrasions that he had 
17 suffered here above the right eye and below the 
18 right eye.

16 whole body? 
17 A Yes, ma'am, head to toe. 
18 I have one question, 
19 On that forehead shot, I know we talked 
20 about some of the lungs, would he be able to still 
21 stay on his feet and run? 
22 A In my opinion that would be a very 
23 disorienting thing to experience. If you think 
24 about it, you have a gunshot wound going from here 
25 through your right eye and exiting. Fracturing

3 concussive effects of a bullet passing through your 
4 forehead. 
5 We've seen people knocked out from 
6 punches, now imagine a bullet going through 
7 forehead. Yes, I believe it could be very difficult 
8 to not be disoriented after receiving that. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: What's disoriented going to 
10 look like? 
11 A That's just going to depend, you could 
12 just look like you're in a stooper, it is going to 
13 depend. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: But it would not have put 
15 him down necessarily? 
16 A I think it is just going to depend on 
17 situation. It depends on his constitution. I can 
18 see this putting somebody down. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: Was it the fatal shot in 
20 your opinion? 
21 A This is not in and of itself an instantly 
22 fatal gunshot wound, no.

4 From 
5 these can you tell the duration between the time 
6 each of these wounds? 
7 A We cannot. 
8 Going back to back, 
9 seconds in between now. 
10 A We cannot do that. 
11 This is a stupid 
12 question, but you can't even tell if those abrasions 
13 were happening, what time they happened? 
14 A We can't. I mean, this all happened, I

16 these injuries look like they are from weeks ago or 
17 anything.

21 sutures in there.

16 make any sense of them myself. I don't want to go

1 His abdomen would be up here, his back is against 
2 the gurney. 
3 So this has been previously shaved, 
4 Dr. had done this, I did not. And now we 
5 can see an entrance gunshot wound basically right at 
6 the top of your head right here. And I think we 
7 have a closer up image if we can go one more. Go 
8 one more, maybe we have one more. Go ahead one

16 gunshot wound to the top of the head. These red 
17 marks that you guys are seeing here, that was caused 
18 by the scalpel blade when Dr. had basically 
19 taken the hair off. Those are abrasions for where 
20 the scalpel kind of ran across the top of the skin. 
21 Now we have an entrance gunshot wound here. Again, 
22 we don't see any close range discharge with the 
23 firearm. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: And just let me ask you 
25 this. This is an entrance wound, correct? 
FAX 314-241-6750

A Correct. 1 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Was there a corresponding 
3 exit wound for this injury? 
4 A There was not. On the x-rays we noticed a 
5 projectile on kind of the right side of his head. 
6 So this particular trajectory through the head went 
7 downward and to the right. It went right through 
8 the right hemisphere of the brain, clear through it. 
9 Clear through the parietal lobe, clear through the 
10 temporal lobe and then they recovered a bullet next 
11 to the base of the skull beneath the brain, and that 
12 was also fractured. 
13 So there were skull fractures at the 
14 top of the head and also at the base of the skull 
15 and quite a bit of what we call intracranial 
16 bleeding. There was a lot of blood associated with 
17 this bullet going through the head. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you explain what the 
19 effects of this wound would have been on Michael 
20 Brown? 
21 A Right. So, you know, we had some debate 
22 with the gunshot wound to the forehead if that could 
23 immediately debilitate you and make it impossible to 
24 have purposeful movement. This gunshot wound, in my 
25 opinion, would be instantly fatal.

1 You know, there are things that we 
2 hear about in the media and the literature, people 
3 getting gunshot wounds through the head and still 
4 being able to do purposeful things. This one in 
5 particular went right through the right hemisphere 
6 of the brain. And then through really important 
7 areas. Motor control of the left side of your body 
8 would have been right there where the bullet went 
9 through. I don't think he could do any purposeful 
10 movement after this. He would have been instantly 
11 unconscious in my opinion. 
12 Q When he received that injury, would his 
13 body become limp? 
14 A In my opinion, yes. I think he would fall 
15 rapidly once receiving this gunshot wound. 
16 He would fall 
17 forward? He would not be able to go to his knees? 
18 A Okay. So that's going to depend on where 
19 your center of gravity is when you receive this 
20 gunshot wound. Again, gunshot wounds in three 
21 dimensional space, they're difficult. I mean, 
22 there's a possibility he could have been leaning 
23 back at this point. It is difficult to say. 
24 If he was leaning forward when he 
25 received this, I think it is still possible he could

1 have hit his knees on the way down. 
2 If he had hit his knees, 
3 is it possible to be no abrasion on his knees? 
4 A Well, I took a look at his clothing, which 
5 we didn't have and obviously he wasn't clothed when 
6 he came in for his third autopsy, but his shorts do 
7 seem to go beyond his knees, around the level of the 
8 mid calf. I think they would have offered some 
9 protection to his knees, so it is possible he could 
10 have hit his knees on the pavement and not gotten an 
11 abrasion. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, hold on. Is this the 
13 last gunshot wound. 
14 A Well, we haven't talked in full detail 
15 about the one to thumb yet.

20 looking. If you want to see those other images that 
21 show the eye and the mouth, let me ask you this, you 
22 talked about the injury to his right eye. Did you 
23 notice anything remarkable about his mouth? 
24 A Uh, no. So when we open the mouth, we are

1 intact. We also look at the frenulae, that's 
2 basically the part that attaches the gum to your 
3 lip, that was all intact. I didn't notice any 
4 significant injury to the mouth. 
5 The tongue was still in place, we 
6 took the tongue out and we didn't see in any 
7 injuries to the tongue either. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. Did you examine 
9 the neck of Michael Brown? 
10 A So with any autopsy we first look at the 
11 exterior of the neck, we didn't see any lesions at 
12 all on the surface of his neck, any lesions on the 
13 back of his neck. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: What's a lesion, Doctor? 
15 A Any kind of a defect out of the ordinary 
16 that you wouldn't expect to see. So we didn't see 
17 any abrasions, any contusions, any lacerations, no 
18 injuries. 
19 During the autopsy you reflect the 
20 skin over the face and then we can look at 
21 underneath, we can look at all of the musculature of 
22 the neck, we can look at the deep layers of the 
23 skin. We didn't see any evidence that there was any 
24 bleeding in any of the neck structures.

1 through your autopsy or examining the photographs 
2 and the report from Dr. autopsy, did you 
3 note that there was any bruising to the neck area? 
4 A No, we did not, nor through our 
5 examination or review of what Dr. had done, 
6 there was no injury to any of the neck structures. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: We talked yesterday a 
8 little bit about this bruising is a very difficult 
9 thing to interpret, would that be fair to say? 
A Correct. 10 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: And people bruise 
12 differently? 
13 A Correct. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: And people have different 
15 skin tones, might make it more difficult to see a 
16 bruise, visualize a bruise, correct? 
17 A Correct. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Can you see a bruise after 
19 you've reflected the skin? 
20 A Yes, especially once we reflect the skin, 
21 you can actually see, a real bruise is going to 
22 diffuse in the skin beneath. 
23 So you can take your scalpel blade 
24 and run it over a bruise. If there is contusion or

1 bruise. But in this situation, we didn't see 
2 anything like that in the neck. 
3 Just so I understand what 
4 you're saying, I know I want to make sure that I 
5 understand it. 
6 It is easier to see a bruise under the 
7 skin than it is on the skin? 
8 A Oh, no, not necessarily. It depends on 
9 the skin tone, it depends, you know, how old you 
10 are, because it is pretty easy to see bruising on 
11 some people that are over the age of whatever. Very 
12 old people have thinner skin. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Be careful, Doctor. 
14 A That is true. 
15 Just because they 
16 couldn't see it doesn't mean the bruising wasn't 
17 there? 
18 
19 
A There was no evidence of bruising. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Again, visually on the 
20 surface, no evidence of bruising, correct?

15 someone were to have grabbed Michael Brown around 
16 his throat with one hand and were to have hold 
17 tightly enough with that grasp so that Michael Brown 
18 could not get away from that grasp, would you expect 
19 to see bruising? 
20 A I would, I would. Strangulation in 
21 general is a very violent act and it requires a lot 
22 of force. And in order to do it effectively, you 
23 need to be doing it hard. So you are going to have

7 do that. And these are again photographs that were 
8 taken during the autopsy by Dr. , which are 
9 contained in State's Exhibit Number 7. 
10 I'm going to show you one that is Image 
11 Number 49, and the picture is always clearer than it 
12 is when I put it up on the overhead here. So if you 
13 need to look at it on the overhead, I can have that, 
14 I can show you the picture, but can you see it 
15 clearly enough to describe what you need to see to 
16 describe your conclusions about this injury? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 Q Explain for the jurors, you have already 
19 talked about this being a tangential wound and you 
20 describe what that means. There is no bullet 
21 recovered in this wound; is that correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
You believe this was caused by a blunt 
24 force as oppose to like a sharp object? 
25 A

I believe this was caused by a gunshot

1 wound. 
Q Why do you think that? 2 
3 A So this is very classic once again for a 
4 tangential gunshot wound. It was going in this 
5 direction towards the base of the palm here and the 
6 reason why I can say that is because whenever these 
7 injuries occur, these skin tags will form and they 
8 point toward the direction from which the bullet 
9 came. 
10 So you can appreciate them a lot 
11 better here than you can on our autopsy photograph. 
12 And again, the body has been embalmed, the tissue's 
13 kind of contract and it makes it difficult, but you 
14 can appreciate several tags that point in that 
15 transaction. 
16 Trajectory is going this way, and in 
17 this area, and I know it is difficult to appreciate 
18 projected on the screen, but I'm sure you guys have 
19 seen these photos in person before. 
20 Again, I would suggest you take a 
21 close look at this area. This was from the first 
22 autopsy, it is after he washed the hand, but before 
23 he took sections of it for special microscopies. He 
24 was interested in this area right here which is the 
25 origination of this gunshot wound where the bullet

1 came from. 
2 So right in this region, the skin is 
3 slightly discolored, it's a little gray in 
4 comparison to the skin around it. It's hard to see 
5 on the screen, but on these images you can see it up 
6 close. That is our interpretation of soot. It is 
7 from the barrel of the gun. 
8 And we can confirm that when we take 
9 this and we look at it under the microscope and we 
10 can see the soot deposits on the skin and within the 
gunshot wound track. (indicating) 11 
12 Q Now, at some point after your autopsy, did 
13 you receive some slides and some photographs of 
14 slides that were sent to you by ? 
15 A Yes, ma'am, I did. took 
16 photographs of a slide from this location and sent 
17 it to me and then eventually sent me a slide to look 
18 at under my own microscope. 
19 Q And we've seen actually a picture of the 
20 slide that you have talked about. Actually, the 
21 slide we had shown during Dr. testimony I 
22 received from the Department of Defense, but the 
23 image that you looked at through the microscope, did 
24 you draw any conclusions about whether or not there 
25 were any foreign particulate in the tissue?

1 A Yes. So what we're actually seeing, if 
2 you guys have already seen this image, it might be 
3 easier to explain. Little black deposits, foreign 
4 material. It is highly consistent with soot. 
5 And again, we see the same thing in 
6 people that are in and around fires that get smoke 
7 inhalation. Inside the airways when we look at it 
8 under the microscope, we can see soot deposits, this 
9 black particulate matter.

11 soot.

Q 
A 
Q 
I don't know what else it is, it's 
Could it be dirt? 
It is not my opinion that it is dirt. 
What does it tell you then if you looked 
15 at the tissue samples provided to you by 
16 Dr. as well as the pictures of the slides 
17 that he has taken. What is your conclusion once you 
18 determine that he believed that there is soot 
19 deposited in the tissue that you examined? 
20 A That this is officially close range 
21 discharge of a firearm at this point. This entrance 
22 wound was extremely close to the barrel of the 
23 weapon. 
24 Q And what would be the farthest distance 
25 that you would consider before you would say it was

1 not close range? 
2 A So we discussed this briefly before, 
3 again, in order to get soot deposition, standard 
4 ballpark number, standard handgun about one foot 
5 out. After two feet, you no longer see soot 
6 certainly, and you don't see any gunpowder 
7 stippling. Beyond 2 feet you won't see any evidence 
8 of close range discharge. 
9 
10 
Q 
A 
Did you see any gunpowder stippling? 
We did not see any gunpowder stippling on 
11 any of the gunshot wounds in this case. 
12 Q It is your opinion that the foreign 
13 particulates, the little black specs that you saw on 
14 the slide that was the tissue sample from the wound 
15 of the right hand, that that was soot and that would 
16 indicate to you that it was a close range wound? 
17 A Correct. 
18 Q Did you do any gunshot residue test on 
19 that wound? 
20 A We do not. The Arm Forces Medical 
21 Examiner System does not do gunshot residue testing. 
22 It is usually through CID or NCIS, one of the other 
23 investigative agencies. We did not do that in this 
24 case. 
25 Moreover, it would have been for the

1 most part useless. The body had been autopsied 
2 twice before, it has been washed a number of times, 
3 embalmed, it wouldn't have given anything valuable 
4 at that point. 
5 I was writing 
6 while you're talking. Are you saying in order to 
7 get soot they would have to be one foot or closer? 
8 A Within a foot, ballpark within a foot. 
9 With gunshot wounds, if it is right up against the 
10 skin, at that point all the soot is going to be 
11 inside the wound. It's not going to deposit around 
12 the skin because the muzzle is pressed against the 
13 skin. 
14 As you start to pull back, the other 
15 thing you will see when it is right up against is a 
16 muzzle imprint. You can actually see the barrel 
17 basically abraded and stamped right on the skin 
18 around it. 
19 So you will soot and you also get 
20 searing of the skin, like a thermal burning affect 
21 from the hot gases of the gun going onto the skin. 
22 As you start to move the weapon back, 
23 the soot will start to disburse around the entrance 
24 wound a little bit and then as you move further and 
25 further back, you will start to get stippling. And

1 what stippling is, is basically the gunpowder 
2 particles, both burning and unburning that come out 
3 of the barrel, they pepper the skin, it's abrasions. 
4 They are not burns, they're abrasions from the 
5 gunpowder hitting the skin. 
6 You usually have to be a few inches 
7 back before you start to get stippling. Soot 
8 indicates to me it is close, we're within a few 
9 inches here, this is close. 
10 So if it were up close 
11 right to the skin, it would be almost like a 
12 branding. 
13 A Right, you would see a muzzle imprint. In 
14 this case we don't, but remember, though, this is a 
15 tangential gunshot wound, the gun is not 
16 perpendicular to the skin at this point. So the 
17 muzzle, you know, if I'm trying to recreate this as 
18 it is in my left hand. The muzzle is going to be 
19 like this compared to the skin, it is going to be 
20 close, it is not right on it. We would probably see 
21 some kind of a muzzle imprint at that point. 
22 Is that the 
23 direction that the stippling shows the gun was 
24 fired? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
The direction of fire, again, is this

1 direction. Starts here and goes in that way and 
2 that's why the soot is deposited here because that's 
3 the closest to the barrel in this location. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Dr. , you 
5 made a further finding in your examination of the 
6 slide or slides, you received several images and 
7 slides; is that right? 
8 A Correct, yeah. Dr. has sent me 
9 at least three or four images of his slide. 
10 Q We actually just used one today. For our 
11 purposes, it kind of all looks the same to me, if 
12 you feel it would help you to explain, we've got 
13 images of all of your slides. If I put up the slide 
14 that you and I looked at yesterday, would it help 
15 you to explain? 
16 A Sure, we can go over it, that's fine. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: I'm not sure. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: You figure out how to 
19 change it back to this. 
20 
21 
MS. WHIRLEY: What do you want to do? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Change it back to this. At 
22 the very end of this we are finally getting the hang 
23 of that.

FAX 314-241-6750 
MS. WHIRLEY: Oh, I got it. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) What we're looking at,

1 Dr. , you and I met yesterday and we talked 
2 about this image and can you describe for the grand 
3 jurors what you are seeing? 
4 A Okay. So we don't really have an 
5 establishing low power shot to kind of explain where 
6 we are. I can tell you this is the dermal part of 
7 the skin, it is the deeper layers of skin. 
8 So you have the surface which is the 
9 epidermis and under that is the dermis. It's a 
10 little deeper, but it's not quite into the fat, 
11 which is pretty deep into the skin. 
12 So what we are seeing here along this 
13 side, this is the gunshot wound track that was from 
14 that gunshot wound into the thumb, okay. And what 
15 we are seeing along the edge here are these 
16 polarizable fragments here, and then this black 
17 carbonation looking deposit. 
18 This is soot, in my opinion. There's 
19 really nothing else on my differential. Dirt, I 
20 don't see how dirt is going to get into that wound 
21 in this situation and not really be deposited 
22 somewhere else on the palm that we're going to be 
23 able to see it. 
24 Furthermore, when tissue is processed 
25 in histology, it is a pretty destructive process and

1 there's a lot of washing, a lot of chemicals. I 
2 would think that simple dirt would get washed away, 
3 okay. 
4 And also look at where this stuff is. 
5 It is actually getting inside the tissue a little 
6 bit. For dirt to just crawl inside of the tissue, I 
7 think it would be difficult to do. I think this was 
8 deposited by force with a gunshot. 
9 Q So this jagged edge along the right side 
10 of the tissue, that's the track of the bullet or it 
11 shows the track of the injury at least? 
12 A Yeah. So in order for me to explain 
13 exactly where this is, I have to go back again to 
14 the photograph of the hand. But this is the bullet 
15 would have gone right through this location and it 
16 would have literally touched and injured this skin. 
17 Q Okay. And so you mentioned the polarized 
18 particles, are those little white things? 
19 A Yeah, these things that are standing out 
20 as clear like that and these guys, those are called 
21 polarizable foreign debris is what that is. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
And the black things are? 
Again, we would just call this soot. I 
24 cannot tell you exactly what that is. It's 
25 polarizable foreign debris.

1 So if you think about when you shoot 
2 a gun, a lot of things come out of that barrel than 
3 just a bullet. You have vaporized pieces of metal, 
4 all sorts of things coming out. So it could be 
5 that, I'm not sure. 
6 Q Okay. Now, you also made a particular 
7 finding about some thermal changes to the tissue? 
8 A Correct. So thermal changes to the tissue 
9 again, it just means it is in close proximity to 
10 that barrel, so the heat from the gun can actually 
11 thermally coagulate the skin. A lot of what we see 
12 in those situations, these are nuclei down here, the 
13 nucleus is inside the cell. They can start to blur 
14 and stream, it is kind of hard to see these as clear 
15 as you would if it hadn't been heated up. 
16 Again, here, there is some indication 
17 that there were nuclei here, but they're all kind of 
18 homogenizing and blurring and blending. It is a 
19 soft indicator there was probably some thermal 
20 affect here. 
21 Q And so when a bullet passes through the 
22 barrel of a gun, does the barrel itself heat up? 
23 A The barrel itself would, there is a lot of 
24 pressure in that barrel, it would heat up. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And then the gases that are expelled?
