5 A I don't think that there's any good way of 
6 testing that. My assumption, and this is just 
7 purely assumption, since butane would be a liquid, 
8 it would be wet, but I think it would be evaporated 
9 off at that point. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: You don't test for it in 
11 your lab? 
12 A We don't normally test for it. Butane 
13 could be tested on instrumentation. I don't have a 
14 procedure, it's never been presented to me to test 
15 for it. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So in this case you 
17 didn't test this substance to see if it had butane 
18 on it? 
19 
20 
A No, I did not.

2 I am going to 
3 ask if it did have butane on it, there would either 
4 be a sticky substance to the bag, it would be wet, 
5 there would be some sort of sticky substance at the 
6 bottom of the bag, but because it was dry and it was 
7 not wet, you determined just from the appearance of 
8 it that it would not be butane in it? 
9 
10 
A That would be my assumption, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Without any real chemical 
11 test, this is just your assumption, correct? 
12 
13 
A Just my assumption. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And it was not tested at 
14 your laboratory to see if there was any butane on 
15 it?

What does latent mean? 
Latent is a term used for fingerprint. 
18 Bottom line is a latent kind of refers to a print 
19 that is when you touch a surface or object, your 
20 print that is left behind is referred to as a latent 
21 print. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
What's a patent print? 
Patent print is a print left like in paint 
24 or blood or dirt, if you have some something on your 
25 hands or fingers and you touch a surface. For

1 and the FBI fingerprint print classification. I've 
2 been through the St. Louis County Latent Training 
3 Program, I am a member of the Missouri and 
4 International Association for Identification, which 
5 are both associations that provide training 
6 throughout, through conferences every year that I 
7 attend for training for fingerprints. 
8 I am also a certified latent examiner 
9 through the International Association for 
10 Identification and I'm also a certified AFIS user 
11 through the Missouri State Highway Patrol. And AFIS 
12 stands for Automated Fingerprint Identification 
13 System. 
14 Q What does AFIS do, I mean, tell us a 
15 little bit about AFIS? 
16 A Bottom line is, when a person is 
17 fingerprinted, those prints are put into the AFIS 
18 system. And then it would be my job to search those 
19 prints to see if I can find a match through the AFIS 
20 system. 
21 Q Okay. What technical equipment, if any, 
22 do you use in your job in doing your latent 
23 fingerprint examination? 
24 A With the AFIS, with the AFIS system 
25 basically I use magnifying glasses.

1 Q So a lot of us we watch CSI and other 
2 programs, and we believe that computers somehow 
3 generate prints and tell us when there's a match and 
4 you see all of these numbers. You've seen these 
5 programs, is that the way it is really done? 
6 A Partially yes, partially no. 
7 Q Okay, tell us about it? 
8 A Urn, when I search a print, the AFIS system 
9 searches the print itself and then it gives me a 
10 candidate list. Of the candidate list, the computer 
11 is saying, for instance, if it comes back with 20 
12 candidates. The computer says this is the closest 
13 thing that we have to what you just searched. And 
14 it is up to me to go into each candidate and do a 
15 one-to-one comparison to see if it is or is not a 
16 match. 
17 So the bottom line is, the computer 
18 does not tell you it's a match, it just gives you a 
19 candidate list. It is up to the individual person 
20 to say this is a match or it is not a match. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
How do you determine if it is a match? 
I check for the minutia points in each 
23 fingerprint. Minutia points or bifurcation, 
24 bifurcation, any ridges, ridge dots, ridge islands. 
25 And arrangement of these minutia points and each

2 each person. 
3 Q And unlike DNA, which identical twins can 
4 have the same DNA, correct? I mean, to your 
5 knowledge? 
6 A To my knowledge, yes. 
7 Q Right, I mean, that's kind of common 
8 knowledge, not that we know DNA here, but can two 
9 people have the same fingerprint? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. And when you talk about the minutia 
12 points, are there a number of points you are looking 
13 for in making an identification of a fingerprint? 
14 A The St. Louis County Police Department, we 
15 have a standard of eight or more points. So 
16 basically what that means is, if I get a partial 
17 fingerprint on whatever I'm looking at, if I can 
18 only find seven or less of these points, we deem 
19 that print insufficient. It has to have eight or 
20 more for us to say it is good evidence and then we 
21 go to the next step. 
22 Q Okay. Any idea how many times you've made 
23 a fingerprint identification? I know I didn't tell 
24 you to look for that information, but do you have 
25 ever a conservative number, have you ever thought

Q

More than 100? 
Probably hundreds of thousands for the 
5 last 21 years, yes. 
6 Q Do you do palm prints also? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And tell us a little bit about palm print 
9 identification, how do you do that? 
10 A Palm prints are the exact same thing as 
11 fingers. Your palms are as unique as your fingers. 
12 And actually, so also is the bottom of your toes and 
13 the soles of your feet have the same friction ridges 
14 and they're as unique as the your palms and your 
15 fingers. 
16 Q Is it possible, like for you, right there 
17 to sit there and touch every surface of that little 
18 table or desk like thing you are sitting at, and not 
19 leave fingerprints? 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, it is. 
And how is that possible? 
There are several factors. The first 
23 factor is the person himself. Some people secrete 
24 their perspiration. What I mean by that, on your 
25 friction ridges you have pores. And you secrete

Page 117 
1 your perspiration through your pores and it coats 
2 your ridges. So when you touch something, you could 
3 leave your print behind by that means. 
4 Some people don't secrete that much, 
5 so they don't have enough moisture on their fingers 
6 or palms when they do touch something to leave 
7 something behind. 
8 The other factors are the surface 
9 itself. Some surfaces are not good to get 
10 fingerprints off of. Another factor would be the 
11 weather. If I was processing these glasses and 
12 they've been sitting outside for the last week or 
13 two or three, any type of weather condition, rain, 
14 snow, heat, cold could possibly destroy a print that 
15 was left on there. 
16 Q And so fingerprints are transferred from 
17 the person to the item. It has to do with the 
18 moisture in there, on their skin? 
A Yes. 19 
20 Q And some people, like who have very dry 
21 skin may not leave a print? 
A Yes, that's correct. 22 
23 Q Okay. So tell us how you compare 
24 fingerprints, a latent print with an ink print, how 
25 does that work?

1 A I do a side-by-side with the aid of an 
2 magnifying glass and I'm checking for the minutia 
3 points, I'm checking for the quality of the minutia 
4 points and I just find a specific area to start from 
5 and just do my comparison from there.

7 you've done and agree or disagree, or is it just

2 would you be checking a deceased fingerprints? 
3 A On deceased prints is usually, you know, a

5 found dead, they do not know their identity and they 
6 take their prints and then we check them through the 
7 system to see if we can find who they are.

1 Q So what were you told to check for prints 
2 on?

4 first thing I do is I check each latent lift, and as 
5 I spoke of earlier, I check to see if each, if the 
6 latent print, if there is any good latent prints on 
7 the lift, if it is has eight or more points. 
8 In the second, if I do find a print 
9 that is good, then I will check if we have any 
10 victim eliminations. I would see if it is the 
11 victim's prints or not. If there is any suspects in 
12 the case, if they have something listed as a 
13 suspect. If we have him on file, then I'll pull his 
14 prints and check them against the good print.

1 any mace can or mace holder or anything on this gun 
2 belt? 
3 A No, huh-uh, not that I recall. 
4 Q What's on the evidence receipt is supposed 
5 to be everything that you looked at correct? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q All right. So what were you supposed to 
8 be doing with this gun belt? 
9 A Uh, I use a chemical called Super Glue on 
10 this. Basically what we do with Super Glue is I 
11 take all the items, I put it into a Super Glue 
12 chamber. Uh, put a little bit of Super Glue in the 
13 bottom of a cup, turn on the Super Glue machine. 
14 The fumes from the Super Glue will adhere to any 
15 prints that are left behind on that surface. And 
16 then once the cycle has run through, I will pull out 
17 the items, and check to see if there is any latent 
18 prints on there. 
19 Q 
20 items? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Okay. And you did that on all of the 
Yes, I did. 
And on the three that you had sufficient 
23 enough points, a sufficient number of points, were 
24 you able to make an identification? 
25 A Can I clarify something?

Q

Yes, please do. 
The evidence, the fingerprints that were 
3 good enough to make ID were from the police car, not 
4 the gun belt. 
5 
6 
Q I see. Copy of this envelope, the five 
lifts that Detective dusted and lifted, 
7 that's where the good prints were. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Of the items brought to me that I 
10 processed, were no identifiable prints. 
11 Q Okay. And did you have, just to make sure 
12 I'm clear, were you not supposed to check the 
13 Michael Brown prints that were lifted, right? You 
14 had a sample of his prints, correct? 
15 A Yes, but when you say lifted, it is more 
16 fingerprinted. 
17 
18 
19 
Q 
A 
Q 
Fingerprinted, thank you. 
Uh-huh. 
You were not asked to compare Michael 
20 Brown's fingerprints with the officer's gun belt? 
21 A I was if there was any good prints to 
22 compare it to and there was none. 
23 
24 
25 
Q 
A 
Q 
There were no good prints? 
On the gun belt. 
Got it. I'm going to reiterate just to

1 make it clear. There were no fingerprints that were 
2 of sufficient number, as you talked about, to make 
3 any kind of comparison; is that correct? 
4 A That is correct. 
5 Q On the gun belt? 
6 A That is correct. 
7 Q You would call that negative prints? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q That doesn't necessarily mean there were 
10 no prints, it just means there wasn't enough for you 
11 to make an identification? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. Now, for the car, which is what 
14 this represents; is that right? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. So let's talk about the car. Where 
17 prints were lifted, is that the exterior left front 
18 door? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And this is where there were 
21 three prints that had sufficient number to make an 
22 identification? 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
That is correct. 
Who did the prints come back to? 
On Lift A, I was able to identify Officer

1 Wilson's print. Lift Band E are good evidence, but 
2 have not been identified to anyone as of today. 
3 
4 
5 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Lifts C and D are insufficient. 
So on lift B and E, they did not come back 
6 as identifying Michael Brown? 
7 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
That is correct. 
Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Questions? 
10 So these 
11 tests, you talked a little bit maybe about the life 
12 expectancy of the print. If it is not identified as 
13 Darren or Michael Brown, how long or how much 
14 earlier do you think those would have lasted? Say 
15 it would have happened that morning, would it be 
16 something from a previous day or any thoughts if 
17 those are not those two prints, when those might 
18 have been put there, any idea? 
19 A Really, no idea. On cars it is very 
20 difficult because, and I don't know how the Ferguson 
21 Police Department, how they, how their cars, how 
22 many guys go in and out of their cars or if they 
23 share their cars. It is kind of difficult to say. 
24 
25 
Thanks. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anyone else?

1 Did you 
2 say what date you did your examine? 
3 A On which one, ma'am? 
The car. 4 
5 A I received, I did my examination on August 
6 11th. 
7 11th? 
8 A Yes, ma'am. 
9 The prints were 
10 lifted the day of, correct, or no? 
11 A On the envelope he has August the 9th as 
12 the date. I don't know if that's, sometimes that's 
13 the date they do it, sometimes that's the date of 
14 the occurrence. Detective is the one who 
15 filled this out. August 9th is the date that he has 
16 in the corner here. Like I said, it is either the 
17 date of the occurrence of the offense or it is the 
18 date that he actually processed the car. 
19 So lifts 
20 B and E were good prints, but they did not match but 
21 you had prints of Michael Brown? 
22 A That is correct. 
23 And they also 
24 didn't match the police officer or you would have 
25 put that on, right?

2 Have you run those two 
3 prints through AFIS to see if they match anybody 
4 that would have been on the scene? 
5 A Yes, I have. 
6 And they didn't match 
7 anybody that could have been there? 
8 A No. 
9 And I doubt we 
10 have any reason to suspect, but as Dorian Johnson 
11 was present, do we have the ability to test for his 
12 prints to see if those are his? Maybe that's not a 
13 question for you. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Dorian Johnson, was he 
15 tested against? 
16 A I was not given that name to check. 
17 Thank you. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: 
19 Would his prints be in 
20 AFIS if he had been arrested at some point? 
21 A Yes, they would. There is something on 
22 the AFIS system, the AFIS system is not perfect. It 
23 is only about a 65 percent hit rate. So, in other 
24 words, I'm in the AFIS system. If I leave my print 
25 behind and I search that print, 65 percent of time

1 it is going to hit and 35 percent it is not going to 
2 hit. The factors that come into play, and the 
3 biggest factor, the two biggest factors of that is 
4 quality of the latent print. 
5 If I touch something on my tip and I 
6 leave enough minutia points of eight or more in 
7 order for that to be a good print and I search that, 
8 now when I got fingerprinted. They may not have 
9 fingerprinted my tip. So that tip may not be in 
10 there. So there's factors that do come into play. 
11 The bottom line is, the system is not 
12 perfect. Just because the person is in the system 
13 and I search a print knowing, if I know that person 
14 is in the system, it still may not hit. 
15 The 
16 only way to say whether or not these two that were 
17 evidence, could be, that were real good prints, but 
18 not Michael Brown's, to see if those were Dorian 
19 Johnson's would be to fingerprint him? 
20 
21 
A That is correct, to check his prints. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Or if you had a card, you 
22 would just need to look at it visually. You could 
23 not count on AFIS? 
24 
25 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: You could do a visual
