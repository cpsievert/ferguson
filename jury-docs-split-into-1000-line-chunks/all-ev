A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am.

Initially.

You realized he wasn't shot in the back, 
15 does that make sense with what you saw? 
16 A Yes, it does, it makes sense, it does, it 
17 makes sense to coincide with what I thought. 
18 Q Okay. Now, did you see anyone with 
19 Michael Brown when you saw this incident occurring? 
20 A No, ma'am. All I seen was Mike Brown 
21 running eastbound on the street. 
22 Q And tell me again why you believe that he 
23 was hit before he turned around? We now know he 
24 wasn't shot in his back. You said you believe he 
25 was shot in his back, why did you think he was hit

1 before he turned around? 
2 A Because I heard gunshots, you know, I 
3 heard the gunshot and when he turned around, I 
4 figure he was hit. And so he immediately submitted, 
5 subdued hisself like, okay, this is real, you know. 
6 Q You didn't see anything that gave you the 
7 impression that he was injured? 
8 A No, I did not. I didn't see no physical 
9 indication on his body whatsoever based on distance. 
10 Q Okay. Was it strange to you that he was 
11 walking towards the police officer? 
12 A No, it was not because he was ready to, I 
13 guess, give hisself up from running based on being 
14 grazed by the bullet and I did not know that 
15 information until, like you said, the autopsy came 
16 out. 
17 Q But, I mean, with his hands up and walking 
18 towards the officer, what was your thinking when you 
19 saw him do that?

16 the beginning because I don't know where the bullets 
17 was flying to, I can only assume that they landed 
18 where they landed. 
19 And that wasn't the truth of the 
20 matter being the autopsy came out and gave clarity 
21 based on what I thought I saw. The autopsy didn't 
22 lie. I didn't know in the beginning, I was full of 
23 emotion and I knew that this individual was getting 
24 shot. So I assume the portions of the body that I 
25 named, he was getting shot. The autopsy came out to

1 where it clarified everything where he got shot at 
2 so. 
3 Q So you assumed when you made your first 
4 statement that the officer stood over him and empty 
5 his clip into him and finished him off? 
6 A Once again, based on me being in 
7 and that's , I can only assume. I can 
8 only assume. 
9 Q Why did you assume that? 
10 A Because some individual getting shot by 
11 police, it was like, really, this just didn't 
12 happen. 
13 Q I mean, don't you think is it possible 
14 that you said that because that's what other people 
15 were saying they seen? 
16 A I didn't base that on anybody else's 
17 knowledge of. I only based it on my assumption, 
18 once again, because I'm in and that's 
19 and that's a blind spot. I only assume 
20 based on bullets being fired and a dead body laying 
21 on the ground. 
22 Q You never saw Michael Brown fall on the 
23 street? 
24 A No, I did not. I can only assume that he 
25 did because of the bullets that was due to his body.

And you said that you could clearly hear 
2 Michael Brown saying the thing he said screaming, 
3 right? 
4 A He yelled, don't shoot me, stop shooting. 
5 Q You remember in your first interview 
6 Michael Brown put his hands up and said okay? 
7 A He was saying that too as well as the 
8 bullets was going off of his body, okay, he was 
9 saying okay. 
10 Q You never told the agent in your first 
11 interview that he was saying don't shoot me, you 
12 said he was saying okay. 
13 A I never told him in the first interview? 
14 Q Yes. Do you recall? 
15 A It comes out, to actually see somebody get 
16 gunned down, you might miss a couple of things, you 
17 know, because it's just a shock to see an officer 
18 shoot somebody the way he did. So you might forget 
19 something. 
20 Q And I'm going to correct myself, I've got 
21 my notes from your first interview. You said 
22 Michael Brown said don't shoot, and then you said 
23 you saw him fall to the ground and the officer 
24 continue to shoot him. The officer stood over him 
25 and finished him off in the head.

Once again, based on my location, 
When you were interviewed first, you said 
4 Michael Brown said don't shoot? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
He was saying that, he was saying that. 
And then in your second interview you said 
7 Michael Brown was saying okay. 
8 A He was saying okay based on getting shot 
9 in his upper torso once again. 
10 Q And now you are saying he was saying stop 
11 shooting me? 
12 A He goes don't shoot, stop shooting, okay. 
13 There was a whole bundle of things of getting 
14 pierced with a bullet to his upper torso once again. 
15 Q And in your interview, your second 
16 interview with the FBI, do you remember an attorney 
17 
18 
19 
named 
A 
Q 
that was talking to you? 
Maybe. 
Black hair guy. And he said, you know, 
20 that it is important that you talk about what you 
21 saw and not what you assume happened? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
And it was after he explained to you that 
24 you have to talk about what you actually saw and you 
25 also at that point knew that there was no shots in

1 Michael Brown's back, correct? 
2 A At that point you're saying I didn't know 
3 there was shot to his back? 
4 Q Well, in your second interview you talk to 
5 about the fact you knew he was grazed 
6 in arm because of the autopsy? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q You knew about the autopsy results during 
9 your second interview? 
10 A Based on what I seen with the graze on the 
11 arm and him turning around. As far as the other 
12 bullets are concerned, I wasn't concerned about them 
13 because of the fact the closure of the bullets, I 
14 was only concern of the graze of the arm based on 
15 his turning around and putting his arms up and what 
16 I seen when he was walking toward the police. He 
17 was getting shot in the upper torso and lower torso, 
18 that's all I can give you based on me visualizing 
19 and seeing what I saw, that's it. 
20 I can't give you the closure of him 
21 standing over him and finish him off with a head 
22 shot. I don't know. I don't know. I assume, once 
23 again, based on me being where I was at in 
24 there's a blind spot. I 
25 can only assume by common sense that occurred.
