10 MS. WHIRLEY: I have one other question. 
11 When we talked about this orange alert button, you 
12 talked about it too. If shots were fired or officer 
13 discharging his weapon in some way like that, would 
14 you expect that alert button to be enabled?

But that is usually, I mean, their walkie 
18 is attached on their hip and it's pulled over. So 
19 they have to reach down on their hip to push that 
20 button. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And then there's an 
22 alert button inside the car also? 
23 A Yes, but it is on the radio itself.

11 We just finished with our lunch break and 
12 so we're going to resume for the afternoon and so 
13 what we're going to start with right now, last week 
14 there was a request for me to try to get some clips 
15 of a press conference or press conferences that 
16 Chief gave or made after the incident in 
17 Ferguson. 
18 So I did find online several clips or 
19 press conferences. And I'm not 100 percent sure 
20 which one you might be referring to, so I know that 
21 there was a question of whether or not he talked 
22 about whether the officer knew or what he might have 
23 known. 
24 So I have two, I have two clips where that 
25 might be what he's talking about.

1 everybody for coming out. Sorry about being late, I 
2 know that the timeline hasn't really played out like 
3 I expected it would. But as some of you are aware, 
4 I've had a lot of Sunshine request, Sunshine Law 
5 request for information and documents about a 
6 variety of things, some of which is not available to 
7 me. 
8 But anyway, I'm here to talk about two 
9 things. First of all, the name of the officer 
10 involved in the shooting and then I've had a lot of 
11 Sunshine request for information I'm going to be 
12 releasing information about a robbery that occurred 
13 on August 9th immediately preceding the altercation 
14 and shooting death of Michael Brown. 
15 It's important to know that I have made 
16 contact with someone who is in contact with 
17 Officer Brown's (sic) family making them aware of 
18 this information being released. 
19 What we are making available today is the 
20 dispatch records, the video footage of a robbery, a 
21 strong armed robbery, a use of force that occurred 
22 at a local convenience mart. 
23 I cannot discuss the investigation 
24 about the attempted apprehension of the suspect and 
25 strong armed robbery, that goes to the County

1 Prosecutor's office. I won't be taking any 
2 questions today right now, but I won't be taking any 
3 questions here. I want to get this information to 
4 you, everybody digest it and then later on sometime 
5 in the afternoon we can get together again and then 
6 I'll take questions. 
7 So I just want to give you a little 
8 timeline of what happened. On August 9th from 
9 11:48 till noon the officer involved in the shooting 
10 was on a sick call on Glenark. There was an 
11 ambulance present. 
12 At 11:51 there was a 911 call from a 
13 convenience store nearby, not this one. At 
14 11:52 dispatch gave a description of a robbery 
15 suspect over the radio. A different officer arrived 
16 at the store where the strong armed robbery 
17 occurred. 
18 A further description with more 
19 detail was given over the radio and said that the 
20 officer was walking toward -- the suspect was 
21 walking toward QuikTrip. 
22 Our officer left the sick call, he 
23 encountered the, sorry. At 12:01 p.m., our officer 
24 encountered Michael Brown on Canfield Drive. At 
25 12:04 a second officer arrived on the scene

1 immediately following the shooting. And 12:05 a 
2 supervisor was dispatched to the scene and 
3 subsequent officers arrived. 
4 There has been some questions about 
5 the calling of an ambulance, the ambulance that was 
6 at the sick case on Glenark was coming by 
7 immediately following the shooting and they did 
8 respond to assess Michael Brown. 
9 So I'm going to have some police 
10 officers going to be handing out packets that have 
11 all the information that was requested on the 
12 Sunshine request concerning the robbery. We're 
13 going to give those packets, first of all, to those 
14 agencies that had made the Sunshine request and then 
15 anybody else who wants them, I think we have enough 
16 to give out. We've got quite a few. 
17 Sorry. The officer that was involved 
18 in the shooting of Michael Brown was Darren Wilson. 
19 He's been a police officer for six years, has had no 
20 disciplinary action taken against him. 
21 He was treated for injuries which 
22 occurred on Saturday. Again, I won't be taking any 
23 questions at this time, but the packets will be 
24 handed out by my officers. The name is Darren,

3 MS. ALIZADEH: I just finished playing 
4 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 91. I'm now going to play 
5 another disc, which is Grand Jury Exhibit 92. 
6 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 92 
7 marked for identification.) 
8 (Playing of the recording of the press 
9 conference and the following is a transcription:) 
10 CHIEF Okay, thank you. All 
11 right. So I gave you a whole bunch of, first of 
12 all, thank you for coming out here. We wanted to do 
13 this in this environment so we can hear each other 
14 and get whatever information we have left out. 
15 So I gave you a lot of information this 
16 morning. I wanted to give you a chance to let you 
17 go over it. And if we've had some questions that 
18 have been coming into our Twitter and so forth, so 
19 I'm going to a address some of those. 
20 A question about the timing of the release 
21 of the tape. So we have had this tape for a while 
22 and you know we had to diligently review the 
23 information that was in the tape, determine if there 
24 was any other reason to keep it, anybody else to be 
25 charged in the crime, we had determined that that

1 was not going to be the case. 
2 We got a lot of Freedom of Information 
3 request for this tape and at some point it was just 
4 determined we had to release it. We didn't have 
5 good cause or any other reason to not release it. 
6 And so decided at the same time it wouldn't be 
7 prudent to release that information which, you know, 
8 could be a little bit, I don't know. 
9 We needed to release that at the same time 
10 we would release the name of the officer who was 
11 involved in the shooting. So that we could just 
12 keep open and give you all the information we had. 
13 We pretty much have given you every bit of 
14 information that we have now. I don't think there 
15 is anything else that we have to give out. 
16 Regarding the second suspect who was in 
17 the store and the tape, Dorian Johnson, we 
18 determined that he did not commit a crime and was 
19 not complicit in the crime. 
20 And clarifying one of the other questions 
21 that came quite a bit was on the role of two 
22 officers. Some were thinking it was the same 
23 officer that handled the robbery as was involved in 
24 the shooting, that is not the case. There were two 
25 separate officers.

1 This robbery does not relate to the 
2 initial contact between the officer and Mike Brown. 
3 Having said that, I will take a few questions. 
4 QUESTION: Do you have any information to 
5 justify the incident of force, particularly outside 
6 department? 
7 CHIEF Okay. I understand that 
8 and these are questions that have to go to the 
9 investigation and I don't think anything from the 
10 investigation is going to be released until it is 
11 complete. 
12 QUESTION: The officer who fired the shots 
13 whether he knew Mr. Brown was involved in this 
14 incident, whether he knew that Mr. Brown was 
15 involved? 
16 CHIEF I can only go up to a 
17 certain point and then it is unreleased information 
18 in the investigation. And that certain point is the 
19 initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown 
20 was not related to the robbery. 
21 QUESTION: (Inaudible) Can you as a 
22 matter of protocol describing conditions under which 
23 a weapon was discharged?

QUESTION: 
CHIEF 
(Inaudible.) 
Okay. All I did was 
12 release the videotape to you because I had to. I've 
13 been sitting on it. Too many people put in a 
14 request for that thing so I had to release that tape 
15 to you. 
16 QUESTION: (Inaudible.) 
17 CHIEF I understand that, but 
18 considering if I just release that tape and didn't 
19 release the officer's name, there would be similar 
20 questions. 
21 QUESTION: Michael Brown's family was the 
22 media's way the police chief has chosen to 
23 disseminate piecemeal information in a manner 
24 intended to assassinate the character of Michael 
25 Brown. What is your response to that?

4 you everything that we have now and everything that 
5 we can give you. From our police department you 
6 have everything we've gotten. There is nothing else

QUESTION: (Inaudible.) 8 
9 CHIEF No, I had meetings 
10 scheduled with the family yesterday morning, 
11 representatives from the family came, the family did 
12 not, they haven't had a chance to completely consult 
13 with their attorney. 
14 QUESTION: We asked you guys questions 
15 about the way you handled this case happened this 
16 case why you are releasing the information you said 
17 was under investigation, you just put more citizens 
18 in trouble by releasing that video. Now they have 
19 to be protected because their store and their 
20 business have been placed in the media. You say you 
21 are concerned about safety, but you talking about 
22 your officer?

2 came here? 
3 CHIEF Yes, he was A police 
4 officer for six years. Two of those years were with 
5 Jennings and four years with us. I can't go into 
6 the security of that officer. 
7 QUESTION: Can you talk about (inaudible) 
8 The officer involved in the shooting was he aware of 
9 the robbery call? 
10 CHIEF I don't know. I don't 
11 know what came out in his interview. I know his 
12 initial contact was not related to the robbery, it 
13 was related to blocking the road. 
14 QUESTION: So you're telling us that when 
15 the officer stopped Michael Brown the first time, he 
16 was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery? 
17 CHIEF No, he was just coming off 
18 of a sick case, which is why the ambulance was there 
19 so quickly, but yeah, okay. 
20 QUESTION: You're saying, what are you 
21 saying, Chief, did he know that he was aspect in the 
22 a case or did he not know? 
23 CHIEF No, he didn't. He was --

2 saying he only shot Michael Brown because he was 
3 blocking traffic being?

6 following the robbery because he was on a sick case.

2 The one question the 
3 reporter asked about why did he earlier say that the

11 does say something about you earlier said this and 
then officer Chief responds. 12

14 know that typically we tell jurors not to do any
