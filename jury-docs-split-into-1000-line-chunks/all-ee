MS. WHIRLEY: When you mention anger, or

That's the words. Those 
15 were my words, I said angry, but you said vibe. I 
16 meant the same thing. Those are not your words? 
17 A I'm getting a bad vibe, were you two angry 
18 about something, that's what he said. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm sorry, I just want to 
20 say, this is very important. 
21 
22

MS. ALIZADEH: All we're trying to do is

A I'm just trying to be honest. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
6 At the 
7 point when Michael Brown turns around with his hands 
8 up and the police officer, I guess, starts shooting 
9 at him, did you ever see him or appear that he was 
10 reaching in his shirt or reaching in his pants like 
11 he had a weapon? 
12 
13 
14 
A No. 
Thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Did you ever see Michael 
15 Brown clutching his torso or with his hand where he 
16 might have been touching his torso? 
17 A After about the third shot, he did have 
18 his hands kind of over his belly, you know, like, 
19 oh, I've got shot in the belly. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So after the third 
21 shot, the total third shot, or after the third shot 
22 when you saw him? 
23 A Yeah, it would have been like the fifth 
24 shot then. 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So from this

1 position his hands came down to clutch his torso at 
2 some point? 
3 A (Nods head.) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: That was about the fifth 
5 shot? 
6 A Yes. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Did you, could you see any 
8 blood or anything on him? 
9 A Uh, no, I didn't see any blood. I did see 
10 the back of his shirt, you know, like somebody 
11 pinched your shirt or whatever, looked like a bullet 
12 went through him. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And when you said, 
14 you said, uh, I'm shot, something like that just 
15 now, was that you interpreting his actions or did 
16 you hear him say that? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
A 
No, that's my interpreting. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I just want to make sure. 
That's the gray area. I don't know, it 
20 all happened so fast. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I understand. That's why 
22 I'm asking is this something you heard or was that 
23 just something that was just your impression? 
24 
25 
A That was my impression.

1 After 
2 Michael turned around and he's advancing towards the 
3 officer and you hear the shots, was it a continuous 
4 burst of shots, was there a shot and a pause and 
5 more shots? 
6 A It was continuous. 
7 You think it was three or 
8 four, or how many? 
9 A It was at least six, maybe seven, like I 
10 said, he unloaded his clip it seemed like. It was a 
11 barrage. It seemed unnecessary. 
12 Again, 
13 after Michael Brown turned around, his hands are up, 
14 either he started walking first or the gunshots 
15 started first, that series of shots? 
16 
17 
A He was advancing prior to the shots. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And just to be clear, how 
18 long had you worked in that Canfield area? 
19

A Four weeks.

11 Having 
12 worked there for four weeks, like you said, and it 
13 sounded a bit like PVC hitting the ground or 
14 something like that. Have you ever had occasion to 
15 hear another sound essentially echo off any of those

2 I'm trying to get a sense 
3 the way that's it laid out, it is tough for us to 
4 kind of visualize how it is laid out. If sound 
5 echos or travels through there very easily or it is 
6 absorbed by the buildings? 
7 A Well, it wasn't like a normal gunshot. It 
8 sounded different and, you know, that's kind of why 
9 I thought PVC to begin with, but that wasn't the 
10 case. 
11 
12 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else? 
You 
13 said sound different. You were there, you have 
14 experience in all of those kind of things that you 
15 say this is something different to you. 
16 A I never said I was in the Army. 
17 That is not what I asked. 
18 You answered with him that the sound of it was 
19 different to you? 
20 A Right. 
21 Different with compared 
22 to what?

One more 
10 question. Just before you heard the first shot, 
11 were you operating a bobcat, making loud noise where 
12 you may not have heard if there were shots before 
13 that? 
14 A That's a good point. I had just gotten 
15 out of the bobcat and --
16 Turned it off. 
17 A Turned it off and jumped out, and then I 
18 heard that. It could have been more before, I don't

14 here as well. All 12 grand jurors and the court

16 videotaped statement of , a witness 
17 that you heard previously testify. His statement is 
18 recorded on a disc that is marked Grand Jury Exhibit 
19 Number 40. 
20 And, urn, before we start recording, I was 
21 explaining to the grand jurors that there is about 
22 an hour and ten minutes of actual time where 
23 is being interviewed by the police. And so 
24 there is quite a bit of time where nothing is 
25 happening. He will be sitting in a room by himself.

1 We are going to fast forward, as it were, on the 
2 counter it will be 16 hours 17 minutes and 45 
3 seconds, or whereabouts, as close as Sheila can get. 
4 That will be about where the interview 
5 begins, and then the interview, there's a break in 
6 the interview at 1726, 17 hours, 26 minutes and 38 
7 seconds. Where asked for some water and 
8 the interview, there is a break in the interview but 
9 the interview never resumes after that. 
10 So we're going to stop it at the point 
11 where he asked for water and the detectives leave 
12 the room to get water, all right? 
13 So, at this time, also just for the sake 
14 of the recording, one of the grand jurors has 
15 indicated he is expecting a phone call that he has 
16 to take. So if I get the high sign during the 
17 recording that he's getting a call, we will go ahead 
18 and pause the video so that he can quickly take that 
19 call because we have to make sure you all are 
20 hearing the same thing, okay. So at this time,

20 interview began. We listened to it until just about 
21 17 hours 26 minutes and 38 seconds when

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME 14 
MS. WHIRLEY: This is Sheila Whirley. 
3 Today is October the 20th, 2014. It is 
Page 5 
4 approximately 8:41 a.m. I'm here present with all 
5 12 grand jurors and , the court reporter. 
6 Kathi Alizadeh is out of the room right now, but 
7 will be joining us a little later in the morning. 
8 We're going to start off this morning 
9 playing recorded statements. So I have three 
10 recorded statements of He was one of 
11 the contractors that was at the apartment complex 
12 that morning and he's already testified, but we 
13 didn't get a chance to hear his statements because 
14 he was present and we wanted to get the live 
15 testimony going. This morning we are going to go 
16 ahead and do his statements. 
17 After that I anticipate we'll listen, 
18 we'll have a live person that will testify and that 
19 is , who says that he was in one of 
20 the cars driving in when all of this took place. 
21 There is also one other witness, 
22 that is scheduled to testify hopefully this 
23 morning, and then we will probably have recorded 
24 statements toward the conclusion of the day. 
25 So with that bit of an introduction, I'm

3 is, but I don't believe it is very long. If you 
4 find any notes, I guess those are probably Kathi's 
5 if you see one with notes on it. 
6 There is two short interviews of 
7 and then there is a longer interview with 
8 the police officer. So those are the three that we 
9 will play. 
10 Probably an hour and a half total maybe. 
11 So with that bit of an introduction, I guess we'll 
12 pause the recording and go ahead and listen to the 
13 statements.

17 again, still October 20th, 2014. The two recorded 
18 statements that we just listened to were from Grand

20 I'm going to now play the interview with 
21 that was conducted by two police
