There's a part of the interview where 
3 says as Michael Brown is running away 
4 from Officer Wilson, he comes to a point near the 
5 corner of Copper Creek Court and Canfield Drive and 
6 he stops. And then he does something with his hands

15 Q Can you show the jurors what he showed you 
16 Michael Brown was doing? 
17 A Sure. He was seated, but he said that 
18 Michael Brown's hands were essentially, I'll 
19 describe it palms up with his hands and fingers 
20 roughly at shoulder height, elbows not touching his 
21 rib cage, but elbows at a natural fall, just as I'm

He described it as more of him looking at

He did. 
And did he also indicate to you that 
18 Michael Brown and his friend were walking down 
19 Canfield Drive toward West Florissant or in a 
20 westerly direction?

22 also said they were walking from West Florissant

3 A Yes. 
4 Q And he could look down the street and see 
5 the location where the police officer's vehicle 
6 eventually was, correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q If Michael Brown had turned around at this 
9 corner and walked in a direction down the street 
10 toward the officer coming from near the grassy 
11 corner toward the middle of the street, would 
12 have a straight-on view of Mr. Brown at 
13 that point? In other words, could he see his front?

1 whether his hands were all the way up or not and 
2 is saying he didn't have them all the way up,

4 that's a typo or not. Are you with me? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
I'm with you. 
Enough to notice this officer should know 
7 he was not threatening him, he was not in imminent 
8 danger, the boy was not threating him in any way, 
9 he's not charging, he was struggling to stay on his 
10 feet. 
11 So he didn't tell you, he never told 
12 you he was surrendering that is as you said, 
13 correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But he characterized Michael Brown as not 
16 threatening the officer in his opinion? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And then he was, his hands, he 
19 didn't say he had them all the way up, he did have 
20 them all the way up enough for this officer to know 
21 that he was not threatening him, did he demonstrate 
22 what he meant by that? 
23 A I don't believe he did. I took it that he 
24 was still making reference to the same posture that 
25 I have previously describe.

I took it that he was making reference to 
3 the same posture that he had previously described to 
4 us. 
5 Q As not threatening, his hands were up, but 
6 he was not being threatening? 
7 A Correct, the hands that I described 
8 earlier, hands up, about shoulder height.

10 gesture you took him to mean?

(By Ms. Alizadeh) Detective if you 
15 can refer to page seven. And near the bottom of the 
16 page where you get to the point where 
17 is telling you about how Michael Brown had ran and 
18 then he turned and then in the last paragraph on 
19 that page, , referring to Michael Brown 
20 says, right at the, he had like one foot on the 
21 grass and one foot on the driveway, and then he 
22 turned around and then he like, like this. 
23 (indicating) So that is why people thought he raised 
24 his hands. 
25 Is he gesturing or demonstrating when

1 he says he turned around and he like, like this, was 
2 he demonstrating? 
3 A Again, making reference to what I had 
4 previously stood up and described. 
5 Q Okay. So when he said, he like, like 
6 this, that is why people thought he raised his 
7 hands, was he making that same motion that you have 
8 already demonstrated?

10 
11

Q

Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anybody else have questions? 
12 I guess 
13 the whole hands up is he -- when you -- I guess, 
14 what would be your definition of hands up, all the 
15 way up or would they be like this or like that? 
16 A Well, I mean, obviously the two motions 
17 that you made your hands were both up. 
18 Okay. I'm actually 
19 reading from, I guess, this is page 18. And you say 
20 your arms are like palms up and hands and fingers 
21 are roughly shoulder length, is that fair enough to 
22 say? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: It is close to the top of 
24 the page.

1 reference to page 17 on that, at the bottom of the 
2 page. We're discussing, this is kind of when we get 
3 into the specifics of it, but he says as he faces 
4 the officer, I asked him, his hands go up to a point 
5 where? And he says about to his shoulders. 
6 So he's making reference, again, and 
7 this is kind of what I'm explaining. He is making 
8 reference to his hands or his fingers being roughly 
9 shoulder height, which is as how he was describing 
10 as I am explaining it here. And then we make 
11 reference to his elbows, and kind of like I 
12 described to everyone earlier, that his elbows were 
13 again, close to his body. I'm not saying touching 
14 his body, but close to his body in a position like 
15 this. (indicating) 
16 And then it goes on, we again clarify 
17 palms are up, hands or fingers are roughly shoulder 
18 height, is that fair enough to say? And he says, 
19 yeah, about close to his shoulders, yes. 
20 So then again, I'm just clarifying 
21 with him that we are kind of, we are talking about 
22 almost a plane here that would extend from his 
23 shoulders to where his fingers or his hands would 
24 be. Did I answer your question?

1 MS. ALIZADEH: Any other questions?

3 to clarify that, would that be sustained for you to

14 have your palms facing forward when you are doing

17 hands up is. If someone raised their arms, I would 
18 think hands up. I would think regardless if my 
19 hands are faced this way, my arms are up, to me 
20 that's a stop, you see what I'm saying? To me 
21 that's what I'm trying to get clarification.

1 his hands. 
2 A Yes, ma'am. 
3 Would that be substantial 
4 for you as a police officer to say that you said 
5 stop, stop or halt, halt, and a person raised their 
6 hands, would that be okay for you to say oh, he had 
7 his hands up, a surrender motion? 
8 A I would say it would depend on the 
9 situation that I was in. 
10 I mean, so this would be 
11 stop. Is it fair to say that he might have been 
12 hurt somewhere where he couldn't raise his hands all 
13 the way up? 
14 A Well, I think based off of s 
15 statement, he was indicating that Michael Brown was, 
16 as I kind of described earlier, that he was checking 
17 himself to see if he was injured. 
18 So, yes, when you and I are sitting 
19 here having this conversation, are my hands up right 
20 now, and I'm am demonstrating what I had previously 
21 demonstrated the position that had 
22 described to me. So if I'm sitting here like this, 
23 are my hands up? Yes, my hands are up.

3 doesn't necessarily 100 percent mean that it would

4 bit and looking at himself searching for injuries? 
5 A Correct. 
6 There is never anything 
7 in here where he puts his arms up to his shoulders 
8 with his palms out? 
9 A With his palms out, no, but again, 
10 remember as I described, he does his hands. I'm not 
11 saying to his shoulders, like palms forward facing, 
12 but he does have his hands at shoulder, yes, ma'am 
13 at shoulder height. 
14 Okay. 
15 
16 
A But with palms up. 
I'm looking at 
17 the line of sight that would have as he 
18 is looking at Michael Brown. I don't see how he 
19 could see the right side of his right hand from the 
20 angle he is at. Seems like he could only probably 
21 see the left arm and left hand, would you say that's 
22 a fair assessment? I know he is looking down 
23 somewhat, maybe he can see something over the 
24 shoulder. 
25 A Yeah, I think --

2 he's a big body man.

4 to comment on that without having been there.

7 you have cause to study police procedures, not only 
8 in other states nationally, but also globally as 
9 well. 
10 A Globally, no, ma'am. 
11 Not in other countries 
12 whatever? 
13 A No, ma'am. 
14 Because what I was 
15 wondering is there a standard norm, would this be a 
16 surrender motion or is this normally the surrender 
17 motion that you see from? 
18 A Again, I think it would depend, every 
19 situation is different and every person is different 
20 and I think every person reacts differently.

MS. ALIZADEH: And just to let you know, 
will probably appear on future

1 him as needed as opposed to try to cover everything 
2 at this point. 
3 I'm not trying to say you can't ask him 
4 whatever questions you want, but don't feel like you 
5 have to ask him all of those questions now because 
6 he will be available for later, all right? 
7 Any other questions regarding the 
8 statement or anything of that nature? 
9 
10 
Just one. I guess with 
that position, I guess that position 
11 that you had his hands, I guess you could clearly 
12 probably see at that time that he was not armed if 
13 you got your hands this way? 
14 
15 
A I wasn't there, but there was never any 
indication given that thought he was 
16 armed. 
17 Okay, thank you. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: That thought 
19 he was armed? 
A Correct. 20 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: As opposed to Darren 
22 Wilson, whatever was in his mind. 
23 I'm going to 
24 go a little bit. She was talking about, everybody 
25 was talking about, could this be the surrender

2 EXAMINATION 
3 BY MS ALIZADEH: 
4 Q Detective , I will remind you that 
5 you were sworn previously on September 9th and that 
6 oath is still I in effect, all right? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q Just to get back where we had left off. 
9 If you recall he has already given testimony about 
10 having photographed Darren Wilson's face and neck 
11 areas and that he then also talked about having gone 
12 back to the Ferguson Police Department and seizing 
13 the gun, and you recall he describes swabbing the 
14 gun. And now I think we're going to take up from 
15 there and Detective , if you want to sit in 
16 that chair. 
17 
18 
19 off. 
A 
Q 
Thank you. 
We will kind of resume where we had left 
20 I think previously you testified that 
21 when Darren Wilson had left the Ferguson Police 
22 Department to go to the hospital, he had draped his 
23 uniform shirt over a chair, I believe or do you 
24 recall? 
25 A I didn't testify to that.

Page 197 
Okay. Somebody else did, I'm sorry. 
Yes, ma'am. His uniform shirt and his 
3 department issued weapon were still at Ferguson 
4 Police Department. He was still wearing his white 
5 T-shirt, his brown uniform pants and his boots. 
6 Q And now I recall there was discussion that 
7 he didn't have anything to change into so he went 
8 back to Ferguson wearing his uniform pants?

12 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And his boots and his T-shirt? 
Yes, ma'am. 
So when you arrived back at Ferguson and 
13 you've already testified about the gun and how you 
14 found it and then what you did with it, did you also 
15 photograph and seize the officer's clothing? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
I did. 
And I'll show you, you've already 
18 testified about the series of photographs that you 
19 took in your, in the course of your investigation, 
20 which I had previously shown you were contained in 
21 Grand Jury Number 10. And I'm going to start up 
22 again with Image Number 24. If you can put that on 
23 the overhead and explain what that is that you are 
24 seeing. 
25 A All right. This is the overall view of

1 the front of the officer's shirt as it appeared when 
2 it was handed to me. He had just removed it. It 
3 was maintained at the Ferguson Police Department and 
4 this is what it looked like when I first seized it 
5 when photographing it. 
6 Q So are you actually photographing it at 
7 the Ferguson Police Department? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
I am. 
Okay. And so you've laid the shirt out in 
10 that manner? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Now, as you lay the shirt out in that way, 
13 do you, are you doing a visual examination with your 
14 naked eye to see if you see any stains or any tears 
15 or any defects in shirt itself? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And the manner that you have it laid out 
18 right there, did you see any stains or defects or 
19 tearings in the fabric of the shirt? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am, not as it appears, no. 
Okay. Then showing you your Image Number 
22 25. Can you describe what that is? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
That is a close-up view of his name tag. 
And is there anything that is on the name 
25 tag or is there a reason why you got a close-up view

1 of the name tag? 
2 A Other than get a specific view that his 
3 name tag, he was wearing it at the time of the 
4 incident and that's how he was dressed.
