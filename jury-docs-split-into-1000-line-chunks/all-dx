15 legs or one of your legs, you got to go down, you

17 Let me ask you one more 
18 question about that. 
19 A But I can't say for him because I don't 
20 know what's going through the police mind, you know 
21 what I'm saying? 
22 So do you think if it was 
23 a police officer, a person of authority and somebody 
24 that was attacking the police officer, that that 
25 would have changed the whole way that the officer

2 A I'm sorry, ma'am, I didn't catch the whole 
3 thing. 
4 Since the police officer 
5 was of authority and that authority was being 
6 disregarded. 
7 A Right. 
8 Do you think that would 
9 change the way he was thinking? 
10 A You saying if somebody else would have 
11 been at the police? 
12 No, no, no. I'm saying 
13 since he was a police officer, do you think that 
14 would have made him more afraid of the person coming 
15 toward him was because he was a police officer? 
16 A I don't know. But, you know, like --
17 Because the man had no 
18 regard, if he had no regard for his authority, would 
19 that mean 
20 A Right, right. You asking me do I believe 
21 the police shot him because he had the authority to 
22 shoot, is that what you're asking me? 
23 If I think he maybe, that 
24 because of Michael Brown's disregard for his 
25 authority.

13 blood relative of Mike Brown.

16 until after he was killed?

19 found out that.

21 him every day?

4 He's actually a blood cousin 
5 also, is that right, Dorian? 
6 MR. He's not blood, but we grew 
7 up around each other, so to me it is blood. 
8 I thought before you 
9 described it as a blood cousin, but he was basically 
10 kind of a friend of the family? 
11 
12

13 just tell us basically what you saw on August 9th 
14 when Michael Brown was killed?

16 was around 4:00 in the morning. I was on the phone 
17 with a lady friend of mine and something came over 
18 my body and I felt, I didn't feel right. I was like 
19 something was going to happen. And Mike, he's on 
20 the couch right next to me, so he just told me to go 
21 to sleep, nothing going to happen, that's all right. 
22 So in the morning, the reason why we woke 
23 up was because my mother called and was like, she 
24 needed me to help her put my nephews in the car for 
25 her and my sister. So I was asleep at that point, I

3 And he can use my phone cause I told him 
4 to call his grandmother to make sure she's okay 
5 before you do anything cause he wasn't talking to 
6 her because they had a little dispute the day 
7 before. So I told him to call her and make sure 
8 He had a dispute with his 
9 grandmother?

11 telling, you know how it is with family. 
12 Do you know what the dispute 
13 was about? 
14 MR. No, sometimes just have, you 
15 know, families have little arguments from time to 
16 time. So I guess it was a little argument and she 
17 went to the hospital that day. So he was staying 
18 with me for that week. 
19 Was he staying with you 
20 because she was in the hospital or because of this

6 And you actually personally 
7 saw this?

9 his knees with his hands in the air? 
10 Okay. And then what 
11 happened? 
12 MR. And then I say maybe about a 
13 few seconds later, I looked and I was still looking 
14 out the window and I seen him shoot him in the head. 
15 By the time I tried to get out of the house, like by 
16 the time I hit the stairs, I heard four more shots 
17 go off. 
18 And then I live all the way on the third 
19 floor, so I say when I first came out of the house, 
20 I heard the four gunshots and then by the time I got 
21 to the end, when I got to the end of the steps, I 
22 heard seven more shots.

19 had on because he was just at my house 20 minutes 
20 prior to what happened. 
21 The reason why I really new who it was

7 MR. Uh-huh. 
8 And, in fact, I think you 
9 said before you and your mom were kind of taking 
10 care of him? 
11 MR. No, it wasn't my mom, he was 
12 at my sister's house. I wasn't even living with my 
13 mom during that point in time. 
14 You and Michael were staying

He just started smoking I

9 Okay. Four months before 
10 this happened? 
11 MR. Yeah. He wasn't no head, he 
12 wouldn't do it like just on a regular day basis, I 
13 would say occasionally. 
14 Occasionally, how often, 
15 once a week, twice a week? 
16 MR. Just holidays, birthdays, 
17 stuff like that. It was not like he smoked regular

12 that were digging out the trenches to put drain tile 
13 or drain pipes in there, did you know those guys at 
14 all? 
15 MR. No, I didn't, but it's funny 
16 you mentioned that because my sister was just 
17 telling me that he was taking my nephews out to the 
18 car, she was talking to some construction workers 
19 and they was talking about that and police and all

3 MR. Yeah, he could have cause he 
4 left my house a couple of hours before we actually 
5 went to sleep. I can't vouch for what he did, you

20 weed that day?

Okay. What makes you think 
2 that he could have? Just that it's possible? 
3 MR. Anybody can smoke at any 
4 time. 
5 What I'm asking you though, 
6 is there anything that led you to think that maybe 
7 he smoked that morning? 
8 MR. I don't know, he was with me 
9 this morning, so I didn't smoke I was still in bed. 
10 
11 MR. 
12 when he wasn't around. 
Okay. 
I can't tell you what he did 
13 I can tell you that the 
14 evidence was that he had smoked weed or basically 
15 THC somehow that day, all right, that's the 
16 ingredient in weed or marijuana. The two of you had 
17 smoked before, I'm just curious about, when you were 
18 up overnight, did he smoke at that time maybe? 
19 MR. Neither one of us smoked 
20 that day. Neither one of us had no money. 
Okay. 21 
22 MR. Well, I didn't have no money 
23 at that time. 
24 Do you know if he had any 
25 weed, any marijuana that day?

6 honestly don't know. 
7 When he got up to get dress 
8 that day or when he was getting ready to leave, did 
9 you see him with any weed or put any weed in his 
10 pocket? 
11 MR. No, he just said he was 
12 going to walk to the store and he'd be back, him and 
13 Dorian. 
14 Let's talk about that. My 
15 understanding is he was going to the store to get 
16 some Cigarillos. Did he tell you that he was going 
17 there to get those?
