Q 
A 
Nobody said oh, I know him? 
Yeah, nobody said anything like that, it 
7 was just me and Big Mike. He didn't say anything at 
8 the time when the police pulled up on the side of 
9 us. The initial pull up Big Mike said, he didn't 
10 say anything. I was the one that was talking when 
11 the police officer said get the F on the sidewalk. 
12 I told the police officer we was just a minute away 
13 from our destination, I live in Canfield and we'll 
14 be off the street closely. 
15 Now, at that time I was looking at 
16 the officer's face, but not really in his eyes. I 
17 really didn't look back up at Big Mike, he didn't 
18 say anything. I was the one talking to the officer 
19 and I wasn't loud with the officer or anything like 
20 that. I was just telling him where we were headed 
21 to. 
22 Q How close were you and Big Mike at this 
23 time? 
24 A At this time me and Big Mike, he's like 
25 right on my back.

Yes, he's right behind me, single file. 
All right, go ahead. 
As I'm telling the police officer we were 
5 just going to get out of the street, we were close 
6 to our destination, I stayed in Canfield. I believe 
7 that he was pulling off. So we continued to walk.

We continued to walk and have our 
15 conversation, but almost a split second we heard the 
16 tires screech, and the officer, he pulled back in 
17 the truck very fast to the point at an angle if we 
18 didn't hear his tires screech, the back of his 
19 cruiser would have struck one of us, not both of us, 
20 it would have struck both of us or one of us because 
21 of the way he angled in reverse. 
22 He never drove and turned around, he 
23 reversed real fast. Why he reversed so fast on us 
24 and the angle that he did in the manner, now we are 
25 almost not inches away from his front door, like we

14 Q So you are at the front or the rear of the 
15 car? 
16 A I'm still in the beginning of the car, I 
17 never really walked and got far to the back. I was 
18 like in the middle of the front door and the rear 
19 door, so I'm like right here in the middle. And it 
20 is more Big Mike because he's larger than me, it is

2 standing counter facing. 
3 Q Okay, all right. All right, go ahead, and 
4 so you all are at the door and then what? 
5 A The officer pulled back. What did you 
6 say? Very loud, angry. 
7 Q Who did he appear to be talking to? 
8 A At the time I believe he was talking to 
9 both of us. Like I said, Big Mike never said 
10 anything when the officer pulled up on us. So at 
11 the time I believe he was talking to both of us when 
12 he said, what did you say? 
13 And Big Mike, in an instant, Big Mike 
14 was finished saying something, his door was thrust 
15 open, very complex, he thrust his door open real 
16 hard. We was so close to the door that it hit 
17 mostly Big Mike, but it hit me on my left side and 
18 it closed back on him, like real fast. Just the 
19 same speed, boom, boom, that fast. 
20 And at that time he never attempted 
21 to open the door again like to try to get back out, 
22 but his arm came out the window and that's the first 
23 initial contact that they had. The officer grabbed, 
24 he grabbed ahold of Big Mike's shirt around the neck 
25 area.

1 Q So did he grab his neck or his shirt 
2 around the neck area? 
3 A It was more of both because he had a real 
4 good grip on him. 
5 Q Was there any warning, did he just stuck 
6 his hand out and grab, does he say something, did he 
7 say anything? 
8 A No, ma'am, at this time when the door had 
9 closed back on him, he didn't say anything. His arm 
10 almost in an instant came out the window, his left 
11 arm, I remember it was his left arm, came out the 
12 window and touched Big Mike around his neck area and 
13 his throat. I watched his hands, you know, they 
14 really tightened up, so yeah, he had a good grip on 
15 it, that what's I saw first. 
16 Q Were you still right behind Big Mike when 
17 this occurred? 
18 A At this time I'm not behind him any more, 
19 we're side to side so I can see everything that is 
20 going on. I'm still in the windowed, I'm still 
21 right here standing in the same spot, I never moved. 
22 And at that time Big Mike, he still 
23 has the Cigarillos in both of his hands, divided 
24 evenly, he never put them down in his pocket or 
25 anything like that.

1 Now, from the beginning of the grab, 
2 it is a tug of war. Big Mike places his hands 
3 openly, one hand on top of the cruiser and the other 
4 hand more right up under the window, the side 
5 mirror. He's trying to pull off the officer's grip. 
6 Q How is he doing that with the Cigarillos 
7 in his hand? 
8 A He placed the Cigarillos on the car and 
9 his hands are on the car. He never dropped a single 
10 pack. He still has them in his hand not dropping 
11 them, but he's pulling away, but he still grab on. 
12 So he never could really get a good grip on the car, 
13 but he's really trying to pull away. 
Q Okay. 14 
15 A At this time the officer, I'm not hearing 
16 what the officer is saying, I'm not hearing what Big 
17 Mike is saying, so now I'm not in shock, but that's 
18 the beginning of my shock level. That's where I'm 
19 like, this doesn't happen every day, something is 
20 out of order here. 
21 They are talking to each other, they 
22 are yelling and cussing. And neither one of them 
23 can calm down, they both have angry faces on while 
24 they are talking. 
25 They both were very upset and they

1 couldn't calm do. There wasn't any wrestling or 
2 anything like that, punches were thrown. It was 
3 more a tug of war and it was very intense, very 
4 intense. 
5 Q Okay. And so please tell us what 
6 happened? 
7 A While the officer is grabbing ahold of Big 
8 Mike, he kind loses grip around his neck, that's how 
9 I knew he had a good grip. He never fully let Big 
10 Mike go, now he has a good grasp on his shirt. So 
11 now Big Mike's able to turn different angles while 
12 he is trying to pull away. 
13 And at a point he turned, now we are 
14 face-to-face, and he put his hands like, grab these, 
15 Bro. And in shock, I'm so not unconsciously, my 
16 hands open to where he could put the rillos in my 
17 hand, but I'm still standing in the same spot. I 
18 never said anything any more, I'm just standing in 
19 shock. I'm this close, I'm standing right here. 
20 I almost feel like someone needs to 
21 come out here and say something to either one of 
22 them to calm somebody down. 
23 At the time I couldn't open my mouth, 
24 I couldn't speak. I wanted to say could someone 
25 calm down. I could not speak at that time and the

1 Cigarillos were placed in my hand. 
2 At that time he turned back around, 
3 facing the officer now, and now he can get a good 
4 grip on the car. 
5 So now as he is pulling away, it is 
6 with more power, with more force. The officer is 
7 trying to pull him inside the vehicle through the 
8 window, like he's pulling him, but he's pulling 
9 away. The officer never attempted to open his door 
10 again after the first initially opening his door and 
11 close back on him. 
12 Now he's trying to pull him, he's 
13 pulling away.

The officer is only using his left arm and 
18 trying to pull Big Mike in and I could tell Big Mike 
19 was, he was getting the best of the officer because 
20 here was in a better position to pull away. He was 
21 outstanding and he was pulling off of something. 
22 The officer was using one hand, 
23 although he had a nice size, I really couldn't get 
24 the full body, but from his arm and when I seen his 
25 arm, he had nice size so where he was kind of

1 strong, he looked strong enough to pull, but not 
2 strong enough to fully pull hum all the way in the 
3 car. 
4 Q Was the car moving at all? 
5 A No, at this time it was parked, it was 
6 still there in the same spot he pulled up in, same 
7 angle he was in. 
8 And by this time there was cars 
9 behind and they could not get through because of how 
10 the officer had his vehicle or the cars couldn't get 
11 through the other way either east or west. So now 
12 we're just like three cars parked more towards the 
13 same direction the officer was going. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
That would be west on Canfield Drive? 
On Canfield Drive. Now, in the midst of 
16 the tug of war, I never see Big Mike actually have 
17 his body inside the vehicle, like the officer never 
18 fully got him inside so much as he has torso or top 
19 area coming toward the window. 
20 Q Did you ever see Big Mike's hands inside 
21 the car? 
22 A No, ma'am, I never, I'm still standing 
23 there, more shocked than ever because I see it is 
24 escalating, I can see and hear the cuss words, I can 
25 see the frowns on their faces getting more intense.

1 the film we saw, he only had the Cigarillos in one 
2 hand. 
3 A Yes, when he initially grabbed out of the

5 grabbed them in the store. Once he got outside the

1 officer standing outside. He was more overpowering 
2 the officer and the officer couldn't get him to 
3 close to the car. 
4 So as he is pulling away, I can see 
5 his hand on front of the car, not both of his hands 
6 were on top. One hand was on top, the other hand 
7 was kind of by the side mirror on the officer's 
8 cruiser. So I can see his hands as he's pulling 
9 away, but then the officer, you know, there's a tug 
10 of war. He pulled him and then he pulled away. 
11 That begs another 
12 question. You said he was getting the best of the 
13 officer. And when Sheila asked you if the car was 
14 moving, not was it mobile, but was moving, like was 
15 it so much force that it was rocking or something? 
16 A I mean, the truck, yes, it was moving. 
17 Because you didn't say 
18 you could tell that Big Mike was getting the best of 
19 the officer? 
20 A Yes. 
21 If he is 300 pounds and 
22 6'3", there has to be movement of the car? 
23 A Yeah, because of the distance, or 
24 whatever, and he was standing, the car was moving,

18 and they see that and they see me with my tattoos 
19 and my dreadlocks asking questions every day. They 
20 see me how did you, what happened, how did you get 
21 your job or anything like that. 
22 So it is on a, it wasn't random that 
23 a person his age would come to me asking me how and 
24 the ways to get to work, to be the life to where you 
25 be comfortable a little. It was just me and him

3 Okay. And with having 
4 that kind of relationship, when this incident 
5 occurred at Ferguson Market, did you have any 
6 opportunity at any time before this happened to kind 
7 of inform Mike what you had heard about the 
8 condition or the relationship between the community, 
9 the African-American community or community in that 
10 area and the Ferguson Police Department? 
11 A No, ma'am, to my knowledge, Big Mike was 
12 living in Ferguson a lot longer than I was. Like I 
13 said, his grandmother stayed in Northwinds, they 
14 still in Ferguson. He knew a lot of people that 
15 stayed in Ferguson. 
16 He was very popular, you know, with 
17 the kids, or people in the area. I was just the new 
18 resident, first time owner, year lease holder, I 
19 really didn't know people around or that much about 
20 Ferguson to give him knowledge about Ferguson and he 
21 stayed there a lot longer. 
22 Okay. So, I mean, did he 
23 have the opportunity to let you know about the 
24 Ferguson Police Department if he's been there 
25 longer?

1 A Yes, but not, he never directly told me 
2 like yeah, man, Ferguson, they really be on us like 
3 that, he never really said anything like that 
4 towards me or never really brought up incidents 
5 where he had encountered with the Ferguson Police. 
6 My other neighbors that stayed around 
7 who lived or who owned their apartment or drive up 
8 and down the street every day, those are the ones 
9 getting stopped and they had their complaints, but 
10 he really didn't talk about Ferguson Police.

12 Wilson, Darren Wilson, when he first accosted you 
13 and Mike Brown in the street as you are walking back 
14 to your, I guess, wherever you intended on going, 
15 hadn't been decided yet, going to go to his place or 
16 go to your place or not, but when he, I believe you 
17 guys are walking east then; is that correct, on 
18 Canfield and he is traveling west on Canfield, the 
19 officer in his vehicle, is that correct? 
20 A If west is going towards West Florissant, 
21 east towards Northwinds, yes, that's correct. I'm 
22 sorry, I don't know. 
23 Okay. When he stops you 
24 and he makes this comment to you, okay, and then you 
25 say that you tell him that you are about a minute

1 from where you are going, you need to get to, okay, 
2 can you write that down for me in relative about 
3 approximately how many feet, did you have a block to 
4 go, did you have like 20 feet to go, 10 feet to go 
5 or what? 
6 A Yeah, like I said, we was just at the 
7 leasing office where my building is and his building 
8 is away from the leasing office is not a block away, 
9 probably 20, 30 feet away. 
10 So about 20 or 30 feet? 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: We can look at the map, did 
12 you have another question? 
13 Yeah, I had another 
14 question. Was there any particular reason when the 
15 police officer gives you an order that you and Mike 
16 did not obey that order to get out of the street at 
17 that time and onto the sidewalk? 
18 A The reason, I mean, at the time in my head 
19 and the response that I give back to the officer, I 
20 didn't feel like I was rude. I knew by law that we 
21 really wasn't committing a crime at the time because 
22 there was no traffic flow and no one was, you know, 
23 we wasn't holding up traffic or anything like that 
24 because cars were still able to pass us. 
25 It was more so, it was more so like a

1 father figure talking to a son and that's where, you 
2 know, we are just walking down the street. But no 
3 one said anything like that, but this is what I'm 
4 thinking in my mind, we are just walking down the 
5 street, we are not causing anybody any harm. He 
6 didn't initially pull up on us and stop us because 
7 of the store incident, which I thought when I saw 
8 him I thought he's coming to get us for the store, 
9 but once he told us just get on the sidewalk, in my 
10 mind I'm like well, I guess he didn't call the 
11 police. 
12 So at that time if the officer didn't 
13 know and I feel that he didn't know about the store 
14 because Big Mike still did have the Cigarillos in 
15 his hands in plain sight when the officer pulled up 
16 on us. He was just saying get on the sidewalk. 
17 Once I responded to him telling him we was a minute 
18 away from the destination, I felt like that we were 
19 not committing a crime, we were having our 
20 conversation, we was just walking. 
21 At that time the officer really 
22 didn't look like, you know, he was mad or he was 
23 telling us that we was committing a crime, he was 
24 just saying get on the sidewalk. We was basically 
25 okay, we will be out of the street in a minute.

1 Did you, I mean, did the 
2 thought ever come to your mind at that point in time 
3 that maybe he was doing it for public safety to 
4 avoid you being struck by a vehicle in the street or 
5 anything of that nature, maybe for your own safety? 
6 A At the time, no, I was not thinking that, 
7 but I could see how that would come into effect. At 
8 the time I was not thinking we was in harm's way or 
9 anything like that. Like I said, cars had passed us 
10 before the police got on the side of us, no one 
11 made, you know, any remarks saying, hey, you guys 
12 are in our way or blowing their horn or anything 
13 like that. So at the time I didn't feel like we 
14 were in harms way. 
15 Earlier you spoke about 
16 the construction worker, you did not speak to the 
17 construction worker, you did not talk to them? 
18 A No, I didn't say anything so much as just 
19 stand there. I honestly didn't believe the 
20 construction worker would give a conversation 
21 because they were working at the time. 
22 Okay. 
23 A I was just standing there. 
24 Could you hear them 
25 talking?

1 A Not so much as, hey, when the construction 
2 worker spoke back, I kind of bowed out of their 
3 conversation. I didn't hear what they were saying 
4 to one another. 
5 You didn't hear him 
6 talking about getting high and something? 
7 A At first I heard because that's what I was 
8 initially going to do. So I heard him bring up 
9 smoking or anything like that, but I couldn't get 
10 detailed on what exactly was said between him and 
11 the construction worker. I couldn't really factor 
12 in exactly what they were both saying. 
13 Where was the 
14 construction worker on your way back, they were 
15 gone? 
A We did not get there. 
You didn't get that far? 
A We didn't get that far. 
You mentioned, you said 
it was almost, you didn't know if you were being

before. Do you think it is possible he could have 
done it before, do you think it is possible? I

1 if it is possible that he would do it at another 
2 store or anything like that. All I can say is how I 
3 felt at that time when I did see that because I 
4 never seen it before like that or the store clerk 
5 react that way or that slow. 
6 Yes, it was like he knew the people 
7 like he had been in that store before, like he knew 
8 them, that store before and he knew things like that 
9 in that store. 
10 It was not like he had 
11 stolen before or he was just familiar? 
12 A Familiar with the store to where he could 
13 just pick up things and just pay for however he 
14 pleases. 
15 I'm going to kind of ask 
16 you the same thing that he asked you. You said you 
17 didn't feel like you were doing anything wrong, but 
18 in the manner that the police spoke to you --
19 MS. WHIRLEY: Speak up a little bit for 
20 us. 
21 In the manner that he 
22 said get the fuck in, on the sidewalk. 
23 
24 
A Yes, ma'am. 
Why were you not even on 
25 the sidewalk? It was not safe, is there a reason

1 why you didn't take advantage of the sidewalk, why 
2 you didn't do that? 
3 A It wasn't a reason that I wasn't on the 
4 sidewalk, it was more just a decision that we made. 
5 When we get down there or anything like that, but 
6 the initial, the reason we didn't follow the 
7 complaint, like I said, Big Mike at this time never 
8 said anything. 
9 Okay. 
10 A It was more like a chastisement than you 
11 are breaking law or you are committing a crime or 
12 you might bring harm to yourself. 
13 If those were represented in the way 
14 he came off to us when he first said it, then maybe, 
15 okay, you know what, we'll get on the sidewalk. 
16 Because of the way he said it and the manner that he 
17 said it, it was more like we're not your kids, we're 
18 not doing anything legally wrong, just walking down 
19 the street even though it could be considered a 
20 crime jaywalking, but we are just walking in the 
21 street, we are not committing any crime or bringing 
22 harm to anyone. 
23 My last question right 
24 now. When the police, you said that the police 
25 passed you?

15 it was a truck, not a car. Like I said, they didn't

3 A Correct. 
4 And you couldn't go 
5 anywhere 
6 A Yeah, at that point when he backed up on 
7 us, I stopped. 
8 
9 A 
Okay. 
Because I felt that he had something else 
10 to say and I didn't want to make myself look guilty 
11 by running away or being startled and, you know, 
12 making a quick reaction, so I just stood there and 
13 complied with the officer even though he never said 
14 freeze or hold when he pulled back. I felt I will 
15 just stand still and see what he asked.

18 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So at no time when the

22 were, does that look familiar?

1 said, he never questioned you about that store 
2 incident? 
3 A No, ma'am. 
4 Q He never gave you any other directions 
5 then get out of the street or get on the sidewalk? 
6 A After he initially said get on the 
7 sidewalk, he never even brought the sidewalk 
8 situation back up. He never brought the store up 
9 after he gave his first statement about getting on 
10 the sidewalk and I told him exactly how I said we 
11 are a minute away from our destination. We will be 
12 out of the street shortly. After he pulled back, 
13 there was no more sidewalk talk, it was nothing, it 
14 was just anger.

20 A couple 
21 questions. I want to keep it before we move on. 
22 When you went into the market, you talked about 
23 payment, did you have money in your hands? I know 
24 you didn't have any pockets, I'm trying to figure 
25 out where you had your money?
