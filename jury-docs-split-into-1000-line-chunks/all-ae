14 scenes and other death investigation scenes, the 
15 first thing that we would do is videotape a 
16 walk-through from my own perspective. Not with 
17 anyone narrating it or with anyone particularly in 
18 front of the camera, it would typically be just my 
19 point of view walking through the scene from what I 
20 know from that initial contact with the officer. 
21 Q And in these cases given that other 
22 officers are already there before you, is it usual 
23 that whatever they have determined the scene to be 
24 has been taped off with police tape, that yellow 
25 tape that keeps people out of the scene?

1 A Yes, ma'am, generally that's the case. 
2 Oftentimes through the course of an investigation we 
3 may find something, obviously, that's outside the 
4 crime scene tape initially, but typically the crime 
5 scene tape is already up, a scene has been 
6 established for us and then we start our 
7 investigation. 
8 Q And I would imagine that, you know, what 
9 you were hoping for is to have a crime scene that is 
10 undisturbed, uncontaminated by anyone from the 
11 outside who is not involved in the incident itself, 
12 would that be fair to say? 
13 A In an ideal world, yes, that would be 
14 perfect. 
15 Q Does it occur that there is contamination 
16 of a scene either because of police officers being 
17 there, other pedestrians being there, emergency 
18 personnel, first responders being there? 
19 A Yes, absolutely, that's one of the tenets 
20 of crime scene work. That's a theory that anyone or 
21 any person that comes in contact with a crime scene 
22 you can either take something away, but you will 
23 always leave something there, be it footprint, 
24 steps, anything. 
25 Q

And so after you have done your video

1 walk-through then, what's the next thing that you 
2 do? 
3 A The next thing we do is after we capture 
4 video, we take overall scene photographs. And 
5 again, it is photographs from my perspective of what 
6 is in place when I show up. 
7 If there is a police car that's shown 
8 up or crime scene tape, everything is left in place 
9 from when I get there and I take my overall 
10 photographs from what is in place when I get there. 
11 There is no way I can photograph stuff that happened 
12 before I get there or try to guess what it looked 
13 like before, so the photographs that I take from the 
14 crime scene are actually what I see when I show up. 
15 Q So it would be against protocol to try to 
16 rearrange things so that they were the way somebody 
17 thought they were before you arrived? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am, correct. 
So nobody touches anything once you get 
20 there and you then go through it, photograph 
21 everything as you see it; is that right? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after you have completed 
24 photographing a scene, what do you do next? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Once we do the overall photos, we would

1 typically walk through and place down our number of 
2 placards to mark the known piece of evidence that we 
3 have recognized or determined at that point. 
4 After that, we'll start photographing 
5 those pieces of evidence individually and then once 
6 those things are documented, we'll then start moving 
7 things, looking for more pieces of evidence. We 
8 always want to be able to show stuff that was in 
9 place, how you would normally just walk in and see, 
10 there is always going to be hidden pieces of 
11 evidence that we need to move, either a car, you 
12 know, a couch, move cushions on stuff and start 
13 looking for additional pieces of evidence. 
14 And then we just restart the same 
15 process. Photographing it where we found it, 
16 putting a placard in place where we found it and 
17 then collecting it. 
18 Q And then when you collect evidence after 
19 you photograph that evidence, you referenced a 
20 placard, is that, explain for the jurors what a 
21 placard is? 
22 A A placard, I'm sure you have all seen 
23 them, they come in various shapes and colors. There 
24 is typically a hard plastic, for lack of a better 
25 term, with a number on it. And the only purpose

1 that it truly serves is for primarily me to 
2 recognize a photograph, what number of evidence that 
3 I'm picking up. 
4 Any given scene shell casing or a 
5 blood drop somewhere. If you find a picture of this 
6 shell casing 100 pictures later of a separate shell 
7 casing, it would be nearly impossible for you to 
8 determine which was number one and which was number 
9 200. 
10 So a numbered placard is just a 
11 reference for my report writing and my evidence 
12 collection of what I've just took a picture of and I 
13 can reference that in my evidence. 
14 Q So after you have placed your placard and 
15 photograph the evidence items with their placards, 
16 you begin collecting pieces of evidence, correct? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And you always have with you in your van 
19 envelopes, plastic bags, swabs, all kind of things 
20 that you might need in order to properly package 
21 pieces of evidence? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
And you do that personally yourself? 
I do. Typically in larger scenes there is 
25 always two of us there. One is keeping notes, one

1 is getting the piece of equipment for someone else. 
2 We are working together doing that, but yes, we all 
3 do pick up our own evidence and place it in 
4 individual bags and envelopes. 
5 Q So if it is a particularly large scene, it 
6 is more than one crime scene detective present at 
7 the scene. Is there one of you that takes over that 
8 that is your scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes, ma'am. 
And so the other detectives that are there 
11 are assisting you? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So when you package evidence, do you mark 
14 the packages or envelopes or bags with your own 
15 handwriting and your notes denoting what it is 
16 inside and where? 
17 A As far as the labeling on front of the 
18 various different envelopes that we have. One 
19 person may write that. The one thing if it is your 
20 case, in particular the Ferguson case was mine, some 
21 envelopes I filled out the front information, but on 
22 every envelope we seal it with a piece of evidence 
23 tape so it is closed and that is my initials and DSN 
24 on the back of every evidence seal.

1 packaged separately, is that protocol? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So after you have filled out the evidence 
4 envelope and sealed it with tape and placed your 
5 initials and DSN on the envelope, do you prepare an 
6 evidence sheet? 
7 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
A receipt? 
Every piece of evidence has a paper trail, 
10 it has a receipt that denotes not only what the 
11 evidence item is, where it was found, but it also 
12 goes to a different part of our crime lab and/or 
13 property control. Our crime lab has three or four 
14 different wings to it, be it firearms lab, the 
15 chemistry lab, the DNA lab, any piece of evidence 
16 that goes to any part of those labs has to have its 
17 own individual receipt. 
18 Q So this receipt that is with this packaged 
19 evidence stays with that item; is that right? 
20 A Yes, not only is the evidence receipt, but 
21 also serves as the chain of custody but everyone 
22 that picks that item up has to sign off on it as the 
23 chain of custody.

And those people have to sign off on that 
Yes. 
And then when they give it to somebody 
11 else, they have to sign that they gave it, and the 
12 person they gave it to then signs? 
A Yes. 13 
14 Q And until the evidence reaches a 
15 destination where it is going to be examined or 
16 tested, does anyone open that package while they're 
17 handling it? 
A No. 18 
19 Q Would you agree that it is the general 
20 policy of whether it is the St. Louis County Crime 
21 Lab or any other place, that if they were eventually 
22 to receive one of your evidence envelopes and the 
23 envelope tape has been torn or tampered with or in 
24 any way changed from when you initially sealed that 
25 envelope, do they notify you?

1 A Typically. For instance, if I, when I 
2 package a piece of evidence, I would put it into our 
3 vault, especially if it is overnight. Typically 
4 these things happen at night or when the crime lab 
5 is closed. Whoever takes that piece of evidence out 
6 of the vault or in the lab, they are going to open 
7 it. 
8 So they will cut my evidence tape. 
9 When they're done with it and seal it back up, they 
10 put a piece tape over top of it. 
11 Q Let me stop you, you are talking about a 
12 vault that's at the lab?

14 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So that's after the evidence has arrived 
15 at the lab? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But the people that may handle it before 
18 it gets to the lab aren't to open that evidence, 
19 correct? 
20 A No, typically I would be the only person 
21 that would handle that before it gets to the lab. 
22 Q Okay. So once it is at the lab and you 
23 said sometimes if it is overnight, they have an

You can drop evidence in? 
Correct. 
And so you know no one else from the 
4 outside except the lab people are going to be able 
5 to get to that? 
6 A Actually, myself, not myself, but crime 
7 scene detectives and our property control director 
8 are the only people that have access to it. 
9 Q So once the lab people come in, they have 
10 one of you guys have to open the vault for them to 
11 get the evidence out?

13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then, of course, if they have to 
14 examine it for whatever testing or examination they 
15 are going to do, that's when the first time this

18 with the receipt, be it if you missed a signature on 
19 a receipt or if you have 30 envelopes of evidence 
20 and one of them does not have the seal on it, you'll 
21 get a call, a page, an email, they won't touch 
22 anything until you respond back down there to fix it 
23 before they will accept it as evidence.

And then after you have delivered your 
7 evidence items to wherever they're going to go, the 
8 lab, property control, and property control for the 
9 sake of explaining to the jurors, what is property 
10 control? 
11 A Property control, obviously, the name 
12 explains a lot, they control the property. But they 
13 primarily take pieces of evidence that are not going 
14 to be tested by the forensic lab and fingerprints 
15 for that matter. 
16 If it is a recovered stolen bicycle 
17 from the back of someone's yard, that's not going to 
18 go to our lab for DNA testing, that's going to sit 
19 in property. 
20 Q It is what we would think of as an 
21 evidence room? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Exactly, yes.

1 another officer who is in charge of the 
2 investigation, would that be fair to say? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q And do you also take instruction from that 
5 officer on various parts of what you're doing? 
6 A I'm assuming you are referring to like a 
7 detective that's doing the lead part of the 
8 investigation. 
Q Right. 9 
10 A They are oftentimes given more 
11 information, especially throughout the course of an 
12 investigation than what we would typically have at 
13 the scene. They are initially outside interviewing 
14 witnesses and other people, be it even a suspect 
15 and/or victim. 
16 At times what they will do because 
17 I'm given basic information when I show up to the 
18 scene, I'm typically not privy to the ongoing active 
19 investigation. 
20 So other detectives, be it homicide 
21 detectives or anybody else would come into the scene 
22 and go hey, we just found out this. Can you look 
23 for this. 
24 And then I may have a piece of 
25 evidence that I already collected that I deemed

1 important to the case, or I assumed it might have 
2 something to do with it, and I would think to send 
3 it to the DNA lab. 
4 Well, they may find out something and 
5 say can you go ahead and send that to firearms first 
6 before it goes to DNA, can you send this to 
7 fingerprints before going to DNA or vice versa. 
8 So they come in and ask certain 
9 things or ask that things be sent or certain things 
10 be collected that I may not have known about 
11 initially. 
12 Q So, for example, while you are on the 
13 scene, a detective may come up and say, hey, the guy 
14 just told us he threw the knife in the sewer, now he 
15 is going to cause you to go look in the sewer to see 
16 if you can find the knife? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 Q After you delivered all your items of 
19 evidence, then do you make a report? 
20 A I do. 
21 Q And your report is documenting what, 
22 everything you have done at the crime scene; is that 
23 correct?

1 list. It is three sections or sometimes four, 
2 depending on what I do at different scenes. The 
3 first section is an inventory of the photographs 
4 that I took and what they show. 
5 The second section if I took latent 
6 fingerprints or developed prints, I would list where 
7 I found each print, the third section is just a list 
8 of the evidence I collected and where it was 
9 collected, what the evidence item is and where it 
10 was collected and the fourth list, the fourth 
11 section would be if I took video or did diagrams of 
12 the scene, which is me listing those things as 
13 pieces of evidence. 
14 Q Okay. And so lets get to the 
15 investigation that occurred at the scene of the 
16 shooting of Michael Brown. And so you were on duty 
17 on August 9th of 2014; is that right?

1 scene? 
2 A Urn, I switched my radio over to the muni 
3 north radio, which dispatches for the Ferguson area, 
4 not for Ferguson, but for the munis in that area. 
5 And I heard several reports of gunshots being fired 
6 near the crime scene, so I stopped and put my vest 
7 on. 
8 Q Okay. What was the call involved in the 
9 shooting, what information were you given when you 
10 first got the call? 
11 A I was told that it was an officer involved 
12 shooting with a Ferguson officer and Ferguson had 
13 requested St. Louis County Crime Scene to respond. 
14 Q So this incident happened within the city 
15 limits of the municipality of Ferguson, correct? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And typically that would not be a 
18 jurisdiction that you would investigate in, they 
19 would have their own police department, correct? 
20 A They do. They handle burglaries and stuff 
21 like that. We typically do not go in there for 
22 property crimes. 
23 Q But in this case being an officer involved 
24 shooting, was it unusual for a municipality to reach 
25 out to the County and ask for their assistance or

1 ask them to take over the investigation? 
2 A No, ma'am. We handle those type of calls 
3 for any municipality that ask. We also handle those 
4 calls for any department that uses the Major Case 
5 Squad. 
6 Q So when you said that you, on your way, 
7 heard on the municipal radio channels that there 
8 were shots fired, are you talking about shots that 
9 were being fired after the officer involved shooting 
10 occurred? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So that caused you to decide to stop and 
13 put on your Kevlar vest?

15 once I got it put on, I drove directly to the scene. 
16 
17 
18 
Q

Q 
And so what was the location of the scene? 
I was given the address Canfield. 
So how is it that from where you were 
19 driving you eventually travel onto West Florissant; 
20 is that correct? 
21 
22

Q 
Yes, that's the round I took. 
And then from West Florissant you turn 
23 onto what street to get?

1 Q So from West Florissant when you turn into 
2 Canfield, that's a residential area, isn't it?

6 correct?

A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
What's the name of that apartment complex? 
I honestly can't tell you. I would just 
10 assume it was the name Canfield apartment complex. 
11 Q So when you arrived, turned onto Canfield, 
12 did you notice a crowd? 
13 A Immediately. The distance from West 
14 Florissant to the scene, if I can recollect, is 
15 probably less than half a mile. And it is a 
16 residential street, all the houses have driveways, I 
17 have been on that street before. There is typically 
18 not a bunch of cars parked on the side streets and 
19 stuff like that, but as soon as I turned onto 
20 Canfield, I encountered traffic basically at a 
21 standstill. 
22 There was some officers that were

So after you made your way through that

1 you arrived? 
2 A I first sought out whoever it was in 
3 charge. I saw some other officers and sergeants 
4 from my own department and I obviously made my way 
5 over to a group of people that were talking. They 
6 were expecting me and I just asked, simply asked can 
7 you tell me what's going on. 
8 Q What information, when you say a group of 
9 people, you talking about police officers?

You didn't talk to any witnesses? 
No, ma'am. 
Or anybody in the crowd? 
No. 
And so what did the officers tell you? 
They told me that they had an officer 
17 involved shooting. They were pretty brief with me 
18 initially stating that the officers car is down 
19 there and at the other end of the street is the 
20 victim. 
21 Q When you, now, the initial call that came 
22 out for this, do you recall was this, how is this 
23 determined initially? 
24 A I was told officer involved shooting, that 
25 would be the typical term they would use when

2 Q Now, several of the items that you have 
3 packaged and also marked, you write or have 
4 indicated assault on LEO? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
What does that mean? 
At my point in the investigation it is 
8 obviously right when everything starts and charges, 
9 determinations, names assigned to things aren't 
10 necessarily set in stone. So during my initial 
11 investigation, we are investigating an assault on a 
12 law enforcement officer. 
13 Q Were you told when you initially arrived 
14 at the scene that there was some type of altercation 
15 involving an officer and the deceased? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And was that described as an assault? 
Correct. 
So when you began this investigation, you 
20 were characterizing this as an assault of a law 
21 enforcement officer, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is that in any way meant to be your 
24 opinion of what happened or who was a victim in this 
25 case?

1 A No, ma'am. Any time I'm involved in an 
2 officer involved shooting, be it a fatal one or 
3 nonfatal, it is always during my initial 
4 investigation listed as an assault on law 
5 enforcement. 
6 Q And so on various evidence items that you 
7 package on these sheets, you list a victim name? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And when you began this investigation, who 
10 was your victim name on these packages? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Officer Wilson. 
That would be the Ferguson officer? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Again, is that in any way supposed to be 
15 some kind of comment on whether you think who was 
16 the victim of this incident? 
17 A No, ma'am. That's how, when we list 
18 assault on law enforcement, he was the victim of the 
19 assault that we were initially investigating. 
20 Q Okay. So did you immediately learn the 
21 identity of the deceased? 
22 A We had a preliminary ID. There was no 
23 form of positive investigation when I started my 
24 investigation. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And so after having talked to the

1 officers about what happened, what's the first thing 
2 you did in this case? 
3 A One of the sergeants with Ferguson give me 
4 a brief walk-through to start my investigation so I 
5 can have a logical starting point from where I would 
6 start my video, photographs and looking for 
7 evidence. 
8 Q So eventually you did a diagram of the 
9 crime scene is that correct? 
10 A Yes, ma'am that's the last thing we do 
11 before we leave. 
12 Q So given that it is the last thing, but 
13 I'm going to use it initially as one of my first 
14 things to help the jurors understand what is going 
15 on, but as I turn off of, as you enter the apartment 
16 complex and at the point where the crime scene is, 
17 Canfield is basically a straight street, correct? 
18 A Yes, ma'am. Where this entire scene 
19 occurred is a straight stretch of road.

It has a center lane marker, yes. 
And is that a double yellow line?

Yes, at that point. 
Okay. It is a curvy street? 
Yes. 
But at the point where your crime scene 
12 was, it is straight and it pretty much is an east to 
13 west street? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And when you started your walk-through 
16 with the Ferguson officer, did he direct your 
17 attention to Officer Wilson's vehicle?

Yes. 
And where, in relation to the deceased

1 did you start on, what end of this crime scene did 
2 you start at? 
3 A Everyone that I spoke with, the Ferguson 
4 officers and my own department, we were on the east 
5 end of the crime scene near the victim or the 
6 deceased as it were. 
7 Q Yeah, because I don't want to get confused 
8 using the term victim because some of your things 
9 are 
10

Yes, ma'am, they are. 
Marked victim is Officer Wilson. So let's

Okay. 
And then any officer, the Ferguson officer 
15 by his name, okay?
