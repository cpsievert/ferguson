just figured it take them 15 
12 minutes to walk over there and get that and come 
13 back. Basically that's what I think that took. 
15? 
14 Q Now, let's talk about the statement that 
15 you write there. 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
And you said that a friend of yours or a 
18 former boss had told you to go ahead and write it 
19 down?

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Have you seen it before today? 
I haven't read it since I wrote it. 
Okay. Since I don't want to, you know, 
24 you have got decent handwriting. I don't want to 
25 misread something since it is in your handwriting.

1 Can you read out loud what you have given in that 
2 statement starting with up at the top, witness cop 
3 shooting 8/9/14. 
4 A Witness cop shooting 8/9/14, 12:00. 
5 Talked with victim for 25 or 30 minutes about God. 
6 He says the Lord Jesus Christ will help me with my, 
7 through my problems. And he said he was going to 
8 the store and he would be back. 
9 Then I heard a pop, thought nothing, 
10 then I heard another and looked over and saw the 
11 victim stumbling and running through gunfire, 
12 figured that he was running from who had the gun. 
13 Then he threw his hands up and yelled 
14 okay, okay, okay, and the police officer who said 
15 nothing emptied his gun into the guy. I believe 
16 seven more at close range. 
17 What happened before the first two, I 
18 don't know, but from when, from when he said that he 
19 would be back, I would say 25 to 30 minutes, that's 
20 what I changed when I talked to 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Minutes passed before shots fired. 
So the 25 to 30 minutes that you write on 
24 there, that was something that you changed because 
25 had talked to you about?

23 them. I think the lady from Channel 2 pretty much 
24 upset me.

22 weeks, he sent me back up there again, and it was 
23 the same stuff, so I just left.

25 what you saw; is that correct?

2 A From what I saw they were saying stuff 
3 that probably shouldn't have been said or wasn't 
4 right. There is something that you shouldn't say. 
5 Q Like, for example? 
6 A I can't remember an example off the top of 
7 my head, but they tried to get one out of me today. 
8 Just things, you know, you shouldn't say. 
9 Q What about have you seen any of the other 
10 people who were there said they saw this, like 
11 Dorian Johnson,

3 and not wanting to live at that apartment complex. 
4 He's been wanting to move out. The first time I was 
5 ever there he came up and said he lived there

8 Q What about anyone else, other than media,

19 Q Let's back up. How is it that you were in 
20 touch with Michael Brown's mother? 
21 A Shirley Washington said she wondered if I 
22 wanted to talk to her. I said I don't know, I don't

10 Brown's mother? 
11 A She asked about Michael and I told her, we 
12 talked for a little while and then she broke down. 
13 I said this is going to be hard. We'll just talk 
14 later when all of this blows over. The other guy 
15 started talking a little bit. I just said I'm going

20 just going to tell her that I thought Michael was a

1 here, is that fair to say? 
2 A I just want this all to be over with. I 
3 want to be left alone after this day. 
4 Q And I told you that I'm not accusing you 
5 or anything, or you're not in any trouble for 
6 anything; is that right?

8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Right. 
Do you believe me when I told that? 
I believe you when you told me that. 
So my question to you is, is that when you 
11 initially talked to the police the first couple of 
12 times, you didn't say anything in those first two 
13 statements about Michael having the marijuana that 
14 you saw that he had and that he was going to go to 
15 the store and buy a blunt or something of that 
16 nature. You didn't mention that or a conversation 
17 about wax or anything like that. Why did you not 
18 mention that when you first talked to the police? 
19 A I don't know. The FBI asked me that 
20 question too. I probably didn't feel that I needed 
21 to stick him into the ground what little bit of 
22 marijuana he had, I didn't think that was that much. 
23 Q So you just didn't think that was a big 
24 deal or relevant? 
25 A I didn't think so.

And you thought that that might make him

5 didn't think throwing more gas on the fire was going

9 can think of that I haven't asked or that you think 
10 is important that this grand jury should know to

14 that -- it all just happened so fast, it is like in 
15 and out and gone. And then all of the sudden all

18 than anything. And then going home and arguing with 
19 the wife because I should have just not said 
20 anything.

22 said anything?

1 you don't know anything other than what you have 
2 testified here today? 
3 A Yes.

6 had emptied his weapon?

A 
Q 
A 
Yeah. 
But you're only assuming that? 
I would assume that, I never did go check 
10 his weapon, no. I would have just 
11 Q So those are things that you just are, you 
12 always assume because of what you might know about 
13 guns and so forth? 
14 A Yeah. That and when I wrote that 
15 statement down, I was probably in shock.

Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
Just thinking about what I saw. 
And the same thing with the shot that you 
19 saw fired, you at the time were assuming something 
20 and now maybe you think that that wasn't correct?

23 
A 
Q 
A 
That's what I thought I saw. 
Okay. 
If that didn't happen, I still can't take

25 Q Right. And I told you, you're to testify

All right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I don't have any more 
(By Ms. Whirley) I believe in your 
10 statement you said you saw the bullets went right 
11 through him, I could see his shirt popping back. 
12 What did that mean to you, did that mean they were 
13 going through his back or popping back in the front 
14 or what did that mean? 
15 A I just assumed when he was shooting that 
16 close they were going out the back and it seemed 
17 like everything, but within two or three seconds, or 
18 whatever, four seconds, it was all done and over and 
19 they were heading the other way. So I just assumed 
20 that. 
21 Q Did you ever see the officer shooting at 
22 Michael Brown while he was running and he had his 
23 back to the officer?

A 
Q 
No.

Did he seem like he was in an agitated 
No. 
That he was like pissed off or something? 
No, it just seemed like he was a little 
and I thought he wanted to come out and 
somebody. 
Did you see him with a weapon? 
No. 
Did he appear to have a weapon? 
No, he didn't have any shorts on that 
18 would have been able to hold one.

The one that did the shooting, I saw him. 
Did you see any blood on that officer? 
No, I would have been too far away and he

You saw blood on Michael Brown? 
No, I never did. 
You didn't see blood either? 
I didn't ever see any blood. 
Okay. You could see shots happening? 
What it looked like, I could just see 
10 blowing out of him is what I, that's what I just 
11 assumed. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
Okay. You're gesturing towards his head? 
I assumed that because when you are that 
14 close with a gun, the bullet has to go through you.

All right. 
That was just my assumption and I would

Probably from his waist up. 
Okay. Urn, and you say you never heard any 
3 of the officers say anything? 
4 A Not until the one officer was taping off

He was yelling it very loudly?

And you couldn't hear the officer say --
That's why, when I say I didn't hear the
