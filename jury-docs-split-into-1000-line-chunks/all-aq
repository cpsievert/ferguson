6 that's the area that we are talking about. We are 
7 talking about this wound right there. 
8 In particular this one too is similar 
9 to the other one that I just described, this is also 
10 a graze wound or a tangential wound, meaning that it 
11 is just running along the surface of the skin. 
12 Now, what is different about this one 
13 is, this is going to be Image 79. So I'll just 
14 describe it first and then we will get to the 
15 differences between the two. 
16 So this one is located 6 centimeters 
17 above the level of the right elbow, so it is a flat 
18 fixed point, so it is up above the elbow and then it 
19 is just to the left of the anterior midline. So it 
20 is more kind of medial than anything. It is going 
21 close to here as you saw in the picture. 
22 So the wound is measuring 3 
23 centimeters by 1 centimeters. In terms of how it is 
24 positioned, it is kind of going, you know, I guess 
25 you say this is 9 o'clock. So the face of the clock

1 is here, this would be 12, this would be 6, so it is 
2 going 9 to 3. So it is going in kind of a 
3 horizontal fashion. 
4 Now, this one, what's different is, 
5 the other one had nice skin tags, we could determine 
6 the directionality of the wound because it went deep 
7 enough and it also hit a part of the body where the 
8 skin on your hand is pretty tight. So it is more 
9 resilient to being disrupted. So it is going to 
10 pick up more changes of damage. 
11 With this particular situation, you 
12 don't see any of those skin tags and what you do see 
13 is a drying or an area of discoloration here on the 
14 outside of this particular wound. 
15 And when I palpated it, meaning 
16 touched it with my fingers, this wound was very hard 
17 and was very firm. 
18 So in this situation, this is not 
19 soot, this is not any gunpowder, this is just the 
20 drying of the edge of the wound where some blood 
21 starts to leak out around the edges and interactions 
22 with air and interaction with clotting, it turns 
23 dark. 
24 So this is just discoloration from 
25 dry blood, this is not soot or anything like that.

1 So in terms of determining distance on this one, I 
2 can't. In terms of trying to determine 
3 directionality, I cannot. This is something that 
4 came from greater that 3 feet away. I don't have 
5 any characteristic things of stippling or soot or 
6 searing or muzzle imprint to determine how close it 
7 is. So this thing is farther than 3 feet. I don't 
8 know exactly even which way it is coming, but I do 
9 on, you know, you do mention the directionality of 
10 it, the three, I can't even say. There is nothing 
11 to let me know which way it is coming from. So 
12 that's that wound and that is how it is different 
13 from the hand wound, but it is still a gunshot wound 
14 nonetheless, but a different type. 
15 Questions about that one?

21 second? I'm not peeking, but I don't know if you 
22 need to take a break to return the call?

This is 81. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, hang on, are you 
4 ready? We just took a brief break and the witness 
5 is still testifying, you are still under oath, Dr. 
6 all 12 grand jurors are present as well as 
7 Miss Whirley, myself and the court reporter. Please 
8 continue. 
9 A So this is Image 81. On your paper, on 
10 the report where I have Wound Number 6, the I 
11 specific area of this injury is the upper ventral 
12 right arm. So what I'm talking about here is 
13 roughly, you know, kind of here in the area of the 
14 bicep. 
15 You have a gunshot wound here, so it 
16 is the upper part, meaning in between the elbow and 
17 the shoulder. The right arm, and then dealing with 
18 the ventral portion, which is the front part of the 
19 arm. So that's where this wound is. 
20 And as I said before, I go through 
21 the same process of documenting the size and the 
22 actual location on the body were two fixed points. 
23 So this one is 20 centimeters below the level of the 
24 right and 1 centimeter to the right of the anterior 
25 midline of the upper arm. This particular wound

1 measured about 10 millimeters by 10 millimeters, or 
2 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter. 
3 Now, what is different about this one 
4 and what I was showing you guys before is, I showed 
5 you one wound that was more irregular, some tissue 
6 was kind of coming out, there was a little piece of 
7 clotty blood, it was more elongated, it had clean 
8 exits. This one is more oval in shape. 
9 And what I can see here on the 
10 picture, which is demonstrated a lot better than 
11 here, but the difference between this one, first 
12 thing is oval in shape. You can make right here a 
13 little bit of pink tissue right here. You can make 
14 an argument is that an abrasion. A definition of an 
15 abrasion is just the superficial layers of your skin 
16 are rubbed off and it exposes the pink of the white 
17 meat of your hand and that's what an abrasion is. 
18 So when these bullets come in, they 
19 don't always go straight in, they can come in at 
20 different angles. So when it comes in and it starts 
21 to rub that tissue off, that's what an abrasion ring 
22 or an abrade is on a gunshot. 
23 If you see that, that's kind of 
24 indicative of an entrance wound. So in this 
25 particular situation you can make an argument is it

1 there or not. I said it wasn't really definitive, 
2 but you can see a little bit there. But around it, 
3 it is kind of like a little bit of a reddish hue and 
4 that's kind of like a contusion ring. 
5 So there is an injury to the skin 
6 from the outside going in. And so this part, when 
7 you see that, these kind of features together this 
8 lets me know this is an entrance wound. 
9 And then the flip side of the exit 
10 wound, the exit wound just pretty much it will stay 
11 the same color, brown color of the skin, you can see 
12 a little bit of purple around it, you can see a 
13 little bit of pink, but it is pretty much just the 
14 wound. That's the difference between the two and 
15 those are the little small differences that you are 
16 trying to look for to be able to appreciate when you 
17 are trying to separate out an entrance wound from an 
18 exit wound. So that being said, this is an entrance 
19 wound. 
20 Now at this point, what I do now is 
21 that, take a step back. 
22 With cases I can also do x-rays with 
23 gunshot wound cases where people are dying from 
24 wounds or gunshot wounds. You want to be able to 
25 x-ray the body to be able to one, determine where

1 there are projectiles, to also see any type of 
2 injures that may have fragmented the bullet, or to 
3 be able to help with the path of the bullet. Main 
4 thing is to see you still have evidence in the body. 
5 So the whole body in this case has to 
6 be x-rayed from head to toe. So this particular 
7 part of the arm that we're looking at has been 
8 x-rayed. So when you look here at what I'm talking 
9 about. Eventually I say, x-ray showed bullet 
10 fragments associated with that wound, that's what 
11 that means. 
12 So in terms of also looking at range 
13 in this case, I said that there is no stippling 
14 identified, there is no soot identified. So that 
15 lets you know that we're dealing with another one of 
16 these wounds that is at least 3 feet away or 
17 greater. I don't know, I can't tell. I just can't 
18 assess it because I don't have those distortional 
19 changes of soot, gunpowder or stippling. They are 
20 just not there, that's that part. 
21 Now, once that's done, you want to be 
22 able to say, okay, I've got the entrance wound now, 
23 I should have an exit. So this story now completes 
24 that exit wound that was up here by the, kind of the 
25 fat up in the armpit, that this entrance wound is

1 related to that exit wound. So once I know these 
2 two are related, now I have determined the path and 
3 the path is based off of what I told you all before 
4 is off of the anatomical position of the body. 
5 Now I know I have the in, got the 
6 out, then I can say what is trajectory of the body. 
7 So in this particular situation this 
8 bullet is going slightly upward, instead of 
9 backward, and it is going up, meaning that where it 
10 comes out at is a little higher than where it comes 
11 in at. That's the upward, upward talking from the 
12 feet to the head like this. So it is coming out a 
13 little bit higher than where it came in at, that's 
14 upward. 
15 Backward means this is the front part 
16 of the body, this is back part of the body. So if 
17 it is coming in here, going out there, you know it 
18 is going front to back, so it is backwards. 
19 In terms of the actual left to right, 
20 it is coming back a little bit this way on the body. 
21 So it is coming to my left and coming that way. So 
22 that's the trajectory of this bullet. A little up, 
23 a little to the left and it is going backwards 
24 that's the trajectory. It is based off of like this 
25 not, you know, jumping around, it is just like this.

1 Now, once that's done, you need to 
2 say the actual path in terms of the layers of the 
3 skin, soft tissue, everything in between you want to 
4 say what will it track through. So in this 
5 particular situation, underneath the arm of the 
6 skin, it went through soft tissue and then it came 
7 out of the skin on the back side on the right arm. 
8 So that's the actual path going 
9 through the body that it went. So soft tissue, so 
10 skin outside, soft tissue is everything like muscle, 
11 fibrous tissue, all of that stuff that is on the 
12 inside of your arm that is not bone, even blood 
13 vessels always needs to be considered soft tissue. 
14 So it went through there and came 
15 back out the skin, so it did not hit the bone. Hit 
16 everything else in between there except the bone. 
17 So that is what I mean by going skin, soft tissue, 
18 exit wound skin. 
19 So now we have one of those tracks 
20 kind of together. So we have the in and we have got 
21 the out, and that is what is going on right here. 
22 Questions? 
23 I have a 
24 question. So given the elevation of the entrance 
25 wound to the vehicle, does that tell you anything

1 about the elevation of the weapon used? The injury 
2 and exit describe the upper going through the back, 
3 I assume it does not necessarily give you any idea 
4 where the elevation of that weapon was? 
5 A Exactly. You have to think about it an 
6 arm, this arm can be in so many different type of 
7 ways. It is very difficult to be able to say 
8 exactly what elevation you are dealing with, that's 
9 why the arm is very difficult. 
10 The fact that you've got you have an 
11 elbow joint, you have a shoulder joint and then the 
12 wrist, you have a lot of mobility within that arm 
13 and it can be in a lot of different scenarios. It 
14 is very tough and even impossible for me to say. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And, Dr. not 
16 necessarily with this wound, but have you found in 
17 your experiences that often with projectiles that 
18 enter and pass through the body, it is not always 
19 necessarily a straight path, depending on if they 
20 hit bone or if they pass through other types of 
21 tissue, you can't necessarily say if it went 
22 straight through, that that was the angle that the 
23 bullet entered from and so forth? 
24 A And that's correct. You have to be 
25 cognizant of that fact that there are things that it

1 is hitting and going through that can alter the 
2 flight or trajectory of that bullet. 
3 This is 82. Same wound, only 
4 difference is there is a ruler for scale. 
5 This will be 83. We are looking at 
6 Number 8. Should be the dorsal right forearm. When 
7 I'm saying dorsal, anatomical position. This is the 
8 front of the forearm, and the forearm is between the 
9 wrist and the elbow. This is the front, dorsal is 
10 the back. So we are dealing with a wound here on 
11 the back side of the right forearm, and that's right 
12 here. 
13 And I've already talked about its 
14 associated exit wound which is here on the ventral 
15 part of the forearm, which is medial. Here is the 
16 entrance and here is the exit, I'm going to talk 
17 about the entrance now. 
18 So we are at Image 84. This is just 
19 a close-up view of this gunshot wound here on the 
20 dorsal part of the right forearm. 
21 So doing same thing again, always 
22 want to measure from a fixed point as well as 
23 imaginary line, it separates left to right, which is 
24 the medial from the lateral. 
25 So in this particular situation, it

1 is 16 centimeters below level of right elbow and 2.0 
2 centimeters of the posterior midline of right 
3 forearm. 
4 The hole itself was 11 centimeters by 
5 10 centimeters. So it is very similar in size to 
6 that last exit wound that I showed you that was part 
7 of the ventral arm. 
8 Looking at these edges, which is 
9 important to do every time. These look, the shape 
10 is kind of oval, but what you can start to see now, 
11 if you look at this little edge, there is a little 
12 bit of a rim of kind of red tissue right here to the 
13 outside, a little bit brown. This is kind of a good 
14 classical abrasion margin. So the abrasion margin 
15 is the thing I talked about before, kind of almost 
16 definitive, it lets you know this is an entrance 
17 wound, in the right situations. 
18 There is some other situations where 
19 you can see this, but it is not an entrance. I'm 
20 not going to confuse you with all of that right now. 
21 But this has the classical features 
22 of kind of being round to oval, having a nice 
23 abrasion collar right there on the outside, that's 
24 kind of critical and that's key. 
25 So when I see that, without getting a

1 probe, I also probe the wound with just kind of a 
2 little flexible rod to make sure my entrances and 
3 exits they are communicating together as they pass 
4 through the skin. 
5 Sometimes the rod won't pass through 
6 and I may have to open up the arm or whatever to see 
7 the actual wound track just to verify. Most times 
8 they will communicate and I probe these wounds to 
9 make sure that they are connected so they are not 
10 just a hole here and here. I'm just assuming they 
11 are together. I make sure I probe them, I make sure 
12 they are in communication whichever. This is the 
13 entrance wound here on the right dorsal forearm. 
14 So once that's being said, this 
15 particular body part, and in this situation when it 
16 is being x-rayed, there is little small metallic 
17 fragments that are showing up on an x-ray. And most 
18 likely these metallic fragments are fragmented 
19 bullet and the reason that it's fragmented is, is 
20 when this passes through the arm, it hits a bone in 
21 the forearm. 
22 You have two bones in your forearm, 
23 you have the radius and you have an ulnar. Your 
24 ulnar, if you feel your arm, you kind of feel the 
25 bone that is on the medial part of your arm, that's

Page 137 
1 your ulnar. The other part of the forearm out here, 
2 that's your radius. So it kind of makes sense that 
3 this exit wound that came out of that medial part of 
4 the ventral forearm, that it hit that bone. 
5 So when it came from out here, kind 
6 of where it is. When it passes through, went 
7 through those soft tissues, it hits that ulnar bone, 
8 shattered it and then that bullet came out. 
9 So going back to your question, why 
10 do exit wounds look different and look odd? So if 
11 you have a projectile that has now lost its normal 
12 shape and it is fragmented when it comes out of that 
13 skin, it is going to have a different shape as 
14 opposed to something that stayed intact. 
15 So that could be an additional reason 
16 for why you may see something elongated, some more 
17 irregular, you have to take into account the fact of 
18 what that bullet's actually doing when it strikes 
19 objects within an actual body. And a bone is a hard 
20 substance and it can be deflected some, so the 
21 actual trajectory is going to be, is going to be 
22 slightly upward, forward and left. 
23 So once again, it is going, this one 
24 in this situation is because the entrance wound is 
25 on the back side of the body, which the trajectory

1 is now forward because I'm like this, but it is 
2 coming from the back and going to the front, so that 
3 is why it is forward. That makes sense it is just 
4 purely based off of this position, not like this or 
5 anything like that, just like this. So it is coming 
6 back to front, and so that's the forward part. 
7 And in terms of the actual things 
8 that it hit, I have actually kind of said it a 
9 little bit, it is going through the skin, soft 
10 tissue, hitting that right ulnar and hitting the 
11 soft tissue again and coming out of the skin, an 
12 exit wound. So now we have another communication of 
13 a wound path. 
14 So we have entrance and exit right 
15 here on the back and the dorsal part to the ventral 
16 part, and we just talked about the one that's coming 
17 in here on the ventral part of the upper arm and 
18 coming out of the dorsal part of the arm, so got 
19 that both taken care of.

1 A A new wound here, 86. We are at Number 
2 4, the right front chest. We are specifically 
3 talking about this wound right here. 
4 Just to describe the image, you have 
5 Mr. Michael Brown's feet here, his head here, 
6 instead of laying on his back you can see another 
7 wound here and this is one of interest. You can see 
8 the entrance to the right side of his face. 
9 This should be 87. So this is a 
10 gunshot entrance wound to the upper right chest. 
11 And as usual, I always do two fixed points to 
12 determine where he's at on the body. So in this 
13 particular situation it is 16 centimeters below the 
14 level of the hole of your ear going down this way, 
15 and then it is to the right of the imaginary midline 
16 of the chest, so kind of right there. 
17 In terms of the actual dimensions of 
18 the actual wounds, it is 15 centimeters, 15 
19 millimeters by 10 millimeters. It is oval in shape, 
20 meaning it is pretty round. 
21 Now the edges, I always assess those 
22 to determine entrance or exit. When you look at 
23 this one, you can see a little bit on the edge, 
24 there is a little bit of a defect there, right there 
25 on the side, so that's the abrasion once again.

MS. ALIZADEH: Sure. 
See that area right there on the edge? 
6 That's the abrasion that I'm talking about. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) You know when you are 
8 talking to them, keep your voice up because he has 
9 to take down what is being said, okay? 
10 A I'm sorry. So this little area on the 
11 side of the skin, that's the abrasion, right, that 
12 I'm talking about, the abrasion collar. 
13 So we have an abrasion collar.

23 Okay. So we've dealt with the fact 
24 that we are looking at the abrasion collar or the 
25 abrasion ring, so that is letting me know that this

1 is most likely an entrance wound. At that point you 
2 want to be able to look for any additional injuries 
3 that need help with range. 
4 So there is no soot, meaning kind of 
5 that discoloration that you see around wounds and 
6 there is to no stippling, that would be those little 
7 small dots that you see around a wound, you don't 
8 have that. 
9 So once again, I'm looking at a wound 
10 where there is an indeterminate distance, is the 
11 body greater than 3 feet away. So that is all I can 
12 say. 
13 Once I know that, I move to the next 
14 part saying what's the, you know, looking at my 
15 x-rays to see if there is any fragmented bullets, 
16 any projectiles I need to get for evidence, that's 
17 the next point. 
18 So in this particular situation, when 
19 I did the x-rays, there actually was a bullet 
20 associated with this wound that I knew that I had to 
21 get on the inside of the body that I end up doing 
22 when I do my internal examination. 
23 So like when I told you all at the 
24 beginning when I said external and then internal, so 
25 when I take all the organs out and looking at all

1 the damages that happens to the organs, at that 
2 point I start looking for that bullet. 
3 So before anything even happens when 
4 I look at the x-rays before the case starts, I know 
5 I have a bullet there okay. 
6 Q If we can, go ahead and describe, I know, 
7 you know, they all know that you opened up the body 
8 and assess the injury to the various organs. Can 
9 you go ahead and talk about that in relation to this 
10 wound generally and then there will be later 
11 photographs and discussions about that? 
12 A All right. So when this one passed 
13 through, went through the skin and hit the collar 
14 bone right there and then went through, hit the 
15 upper portion of the right lung and then it went in 
16 between, so your rib cage, you have to think of it 
17 like a bare front part. Your ribs wrap all the way 
18 back to your spine. So when it passed through, your

21 
22 
23 
body is three dimensional looking from the side, 
comes in here, passed through that skin, soft 
tissuing, hitting that collar bone right there, 
hitting the upper portion of the lung and then 
burying itself in between the intercostal space 
24 the third rib.

1 ribs total. Think of that as a ladder. So you have 
2 rib one, you've got rib two. In between rib one and 
3 rib two that's called the intercostal space. That 
4 is just the spot in between two ribs. So in between 
5 ribs three and four, that's where I got the bullet 
6 from this particular wound. 
7 So when this bullet went through the 
8 lung, it damaged the lung and created a defect. I 
9 think the defect is 2 centimeters in dimension. And 
10 then at the same time there was blood present within 
11 the thoracic cavity. The thoracic cavity are the 
12 chambers, you have two on both sides of your chest 
13 cavity. You've got a left side, you've got a right 
14 side. 
15 So within that right side, 
16 400 millimeters worth of blood, which is a decent 
17 amount filled up within that side of his body. So 
18 those are all the main kind of injuries associated 
19 with the path of this bullet going through, hitting 
20 that bone, hitting that lung and then burying itself 
21 in the back part of the thoracic cap area. 
22 MS. WHIRLEY: Sheila Whirley. With that 
23 wound, would he have been able to survive that 
24 wound?

a while? 
15 The trajectory 
16 entered here is that it hit the collar bone, did the 
17 collar bone deflect it downward, you think, the path 
18 of the bullet? 
19 A It is possible, but it is hard to tell 
20 exactly what role that is going to play with the 
21 bullet. It is a wild card. You know, if it wasn't 
22 there, it went straight through the body, came out 
23 the back we all know, but the main thing you can say 
24 about it is, it is going to slow it down. It did 
25 fragment the bullet, it kind of broke it up a little

1 bit and it is going to slow it down, but that is 
2 about all you can really say. It is kind of an 
3 intermediate thing in between where it stops. 
4 You can't say it is a 
5 downward shot, it could have been a straight edge 
6 shot?

It could be straight or down. 
Okay. 
You have to think about your head too, 
10 your head is on a pivot, so pivot, you know, like 
11 that. And say something is passing through it is 
12 possible it could do that or it could be a straight 
13 on shot. 
14 That's the variability that you have 
15 with wounds when you are dealing with something 
16 close to a joint or something, close where something 
17 can pivot around because you can get an exit from 
18 something from someplace else and reenter another 
19 place in the body. And that's what makes it 
20 difficult when you weren't actually there. 
21 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So I'm not saying this 
22 is true in this case, but you are saying you can 
23 have a bullet that would pass through someone's arm, 
24 so you have an entrance wound and exit wound of the 
25 upper arm, for example. And then the bullet can

A That is correct. 
Grand Jury

3 Q And do you have any way to know whether 
4 that was the case in any of these wounds? 
5 
6 
A No, I do not. 
It was mentioned 
7 earlier, do you have any indication that the grazing 
8 from the hand could have been one of the chest 
9 entered wounds? 
10 A It is possible if your hand is in the 
11 right way for that to happen, it is possible. But 
12 all I can say about that wound is that, I have an 
13 idea of range and I have an idea of directionality, 
14 but that's really all that I can I definitely 
15 know from my examination, but after it left there, 
16 there is a lot of possibilities. 
17 This is 88. And the only difference 
18 with this one is the introduction of the ruler. 
19 A new wound here. This is going to 
20 be Number 5, lateral right chest. So as always, 
21 this is a gunshot entrance wound, it is located 
22 20 centimeters below the level of the right auditory 
23 meatus and then it is to the right of this imaginary 
24 midline of the chest. That is how you know where it 
25 is located.

1 In terms of the size, it is 
2 12 millimeters by 12 millimeters, and this one kind 
3 of has a little kind of a teardrop or somewhat of a 
4 oval type shape to it. 
5 There is a very small abrasion ring 
6 around it and that is just that defect that you see 
7 associated with wounds and when bullets pass through 
8 the skin, it rubs off that little area as it is 
9 entering. So that is kind of letting me know that 
10 this is an entrance wound. 
11 As I always do, want to try to help 
12 yourself with range if you can. So I look for soot 
13 and I look for stippling. There isn't any on this 
14 wound, so now I'm dealing with another wound that is 
15 most likely greater than 3 feet away. I don't know 
16 how close, it is an indeterminate distance. 
17 Sox-rays are done, so there is a 
18 bullet associated with this wound as well. And it 
19 is further down in the body and I recovered it from 
20 the lateral part, which is kind of out here, of the 
21 right back. So it is kind of coming up here, but I 
22 end up getting the bullet out around down here, just 
23 so you know. 
24 So that kind of lets you know there 
25 is a downward trajectory with this particular wound

1 that is based off of this position. So it is coming 
2 in here and getting here, you already know it is 
3 going down. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: has a 
5 question, Doctor. 
6 I notice on both of these 
7 that there is other like bruising and other stuff? 
8 A What are you referring to? 
9 The other picture, just 
10 the last wound that we saw. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: You want to point with 
12 this? 
A This picture. 13 
14 Both of them around the 
15 wound. All of this stuff around here, is that 
16 normal, is that bruising? 
17 A Are you talking, like this? 
Yeah 18 
19 A That is just kind of smeared blood. 
20 I know it was worse on the 
21 last one. 
22 A That is not bruising. So bruising, the 
23 technical means contusion. So bruising, contusion 
24 these are kind of synonymous words. 
25 The difference between that, and this

1 is just kind of being an artifactual thing, this is 
2 something on the outside of the skin, it is on the 
3 surface. A contusion or a bruise, that's blood 
4 underneath the skin surface. So it is like, you 
5 know, someone punches you, kind of turns blue, green 
6 whatever over time, you have blood underneath your 
7 skin that is going through the process of changing 
8 colors. 
9 So in this situation, this stuff 
10 that's here, this is just some artifact and just 
11 kind of cleaning off the wound and it is blood that 
12 kind of transfers from here out to the skin so that 
13 is not a contusion. 
14 Okay. Now, so we got the trajectory, 
15 you know, in turn, what did this pass through. It 
16 went through the skin, it went through the soft 
17 tissue, and as it is going down, you have got to 
18 once to think about your rib cage, kind of like a 
19 barrel. 
20 When it goes down through that skin, 
21 you have ribs kind of jetting out there, it kept 
22 going down and that rib, that eighth rib, you have 
23 12, it is kind of sticking out and the bullet hit 
24 that. It fractured that rib and it kind of bounced 
25 off a little bit and just stayed in the soft tissue.

1 The problem with that injury is, when 
2 that rib fractured, it fractured to the inside and 
3 the lung, the bottom portion of the right lung he 
4 had got punctured because of the breaking of the 
5 bone. 
6 So there is an additional injury to 
7 the lung further down. You have got one at the top 
8 too, one in the upper chest, now you have one 
9 further down. So there is a puncture wound from a 
10 bone breaking from a bullet hitting it, and you have 
11 got one that's just a gunshot wound that is actually 
12 hitting the lung. 
13 So there is going to be a little bit 
14 of blood coming out of that wound as well. So these 
15 two gunshot wounds technically of the chest, that 
16 400 millimeters of blood is going to be associated 
17 with both of those wounds. And so it is important 
18 to know that those can be ruled the same, they are 
19 both causing injuries to the body that if not 
20 corrected, it could end someone's life, but in this 
21 situation there is another wound to the head that 
22 I'm going to talk about. I just want to make sure 
23 that you understand the separation of the two. 
24 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So, Dr. this 
25 wound then, without medical care could be fatal, but

1 not immediately so? 
A Exactly. 2 
3 Q And again, with this type of wound, a 
4 person sustaining that would they be able to stand 
5 and be mobile for a while? 
6 A Yes.

11 Fatally, you know what the 
12 final one was, you don't really know --
13 A Right. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So far, just to be 
15 clear, and we don't, you can't say so far the 
16 sequence of these wounds?

18

So this is the same wound that we are

25 a number. This is 90, I'm sorry.

91. So the head of Mr. Michael 
2 Brown, we are looking at the right side of the face. 
3 And the wound that I'm going to be getting to next 
4 is going to be Number 3. It is going to be right 
5 here, it is going to be an exit wound of the right 
6 jaw. 
7 This is just showing from the top 
8 down, just showing some more wounds of the face. 
9 This is 93. So this is his neck, 
10 this is the top part of his head here and you have 
11 this exit wound here of his right jaw. So let's 
12 walk through this one. 
13 So this one is located about 
14 5.5 centimeters below the level of the right ear 
15 hole and then it is to the right of the anterior of 
16 midline of the head, which is like that. So it is 
17 to the right. The hole measures 15 millimeters by 9 
18 millimeters. 
19 Now looking at the contours of it, 
20 the contours meaning the edges, I do that on every 
21 wound that I see, the gunshot wounds. If you look 
22 at this one, you kind of see this little edge is 
23 kind of flapping over a little bit. You don't see 
24 those good little peak margins that are around it, 
25 it is a little more irregular, it is not as smooth.

1 And you kind of actually see a little bit of tissue 
2 kind of streaming out there and a little bit 
3 flopping out of the wound to the outside. 
4 So when I look at all of the 
5 constellation of all of these things, this is 
6 letting me know this is consistent with an exit 
7 wound. 
8 I don't see any stippling, I don't 
9 see any soot, shouldn't see that in an exit wound, 
10 but the thing is it is a little more irregular,
