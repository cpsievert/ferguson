Do you think that's the most accurate 
13 statement that you have since that was prepared the 
14 soonest? 
15 A At the time I thought it was, but I really 
16 don't think I should have wrote anything down like 
17 that and the stuff that was going through my head. 
18 I've never seen anything like that. I truly believe 
19 I was probably in shock for a little while after 
20 that. 
21 Q Okay. You've seen this statement,

23 A I've seen that statement, but then after,

(By Ms. Alizadeh) , you had 
15 said something interesting just now, you said 
16 something about he didn't have a weapon because he 
17 didn't have any pockets, and you are talking about 
18 Michael? 
19 A Yeah, Michael. I don't know what you call 
20 them, wear around the house shorts, just comfortable 
21 shorts. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: Did he change clothes from 
23 the first time you saw him, until the shooting?

2 A I don't even remember what color his shirt 
3 was. I just remember the shorts were gray. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: So now, if I were to tell 
5 you that, you know, of course we know what shorts he 
6 had on when he was shot because, of course, those 
7 clothes have been seized. If I were to tell you 
8 that his shorts had pockets in them, does that 
9 change your opinion of when you said he couldn't of 
10 had a weapon because he didn't have any pockets. 
11 A That wouldn't change my theory on that 
12 because they were those really light, you know, soft 
13 towel looking shorts, I believe. Where there is no 
14 thread to tie them. I didn't look in there, but I 
15 wouldn't think you could put a gun in there. I 
16 don't have a pistol, I don't own a gun. 
17 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Do you know what cargo 
18 shorts are, khakis, cargo? 
19 A I don't think that's what he was wearing. 
20 He might have been, I mean really, I don't think 
21 that's what he was wearing. 
22 Q Okay. But when you saw him, and trust me, 
23 I'm not saying he had a weapon, we now know he 
24 didn't have a weapon, my question is, when you saw 
25 him, you just said that he didn't have a weapon

1 because he didn't have any shorts with pockets in

3 A Oh, when you ask if he had a weapon, I 
4 would say no because I don't think those shorts 
5 would be able to hold it. 
6 Q Okay. 
7 A But then again, you know. 
8 Q But that's an assumption on your part, 
9 right? 
10 A Okay, all right. I see where you are 
11 going, I understand. 
12 Q So we don't know, and like you said, we 
13 don't know what happened before you saw him run past 
14 that building into your view, correct? 
15 A Yes. So then I just say, I didn't 
16 physically see a weapon on him. 
17 
18 
Q Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So when the officer, when 
19 Michael Brown turned around and was staggering as 
20 you said, moving toward the officer, did it appear 
21 to you that he was charging the officer? 
22 A No, it appears to me that he was just 
23 catching his balance. That's when I thought, where 
24 I assumed again that he had been hit with the second 
25 shot, which I don't know.

16 You 
17 mentioned in your statements that when you spoke 
18 with Michael, that you thought he was mentally slow. 
19 And you said you observed that by the way that he 
20 spoke, he spoke very softly. 
21 A Yes. 
22 As he spoke, he raised his 
23 head back and fluttered his eyelids and stuff like 
24 that. Have you ever had the opportunity to deal

1 autistic? 
2 A No, I have never met anybody autistic 
3 other than on TV or something. I don't know what 
4 autism is actually really. 
5 Q The reason why I ask is, I have personal 
6 experience with it and sometimes when you come 
7 across people or adults that have autism, they tend 
8 to do repetitious kind of actions. So you 
9 mentioned, you mentioned that kind of brought it to 
10 mind when he spoke, he raised his head back and 
11 fluttered his eyelids. I'm assuming, since you 
12 brought that up, it was more than once that he did 
13 that? 
14 A Every time he talked. 
15 Q Every time he talked? 
16 A Except for when he was walking to the 
17 store. He might of, but I didn't pick up on it when

19 pick up on it.

1 Michael Brown? 
2 A I didn't even know who he was, he just 
3 walked up and started watching me working. 
4 This is first time you two 
5 met, is that my understanding? 
6 A Yes. 
7 You had 
8 opportunity to see a person just a few minutes, 10 
9 minutes, 15 minutes ago, take marijuana or some 
10 other drug in his system, you happen to see sometime 
11 in person like that?

13 
A I didn't hear. 
A person who has drugs, 
14 he use drugs, marijuana, cocaine or maybe --
15 A Do I know people that used that? 
16 You see people who use 
17 that, say 15, 20 minutes after they use the drug, 
18 you see people like that? 
19 A I know people like that. 
20 What do you see in that 
21 person? 
22 A They're just high. I don't know how to

4 A Some people, I would say it all hits

6 Thank you. 
7 I'm 
8 going to go on there. I have seen people that have 
9 been high on marijuana and this is not meant to be 
10 funny, sometimes it is hard to tell the difference 
11 between high and being slow because that's what it 
12 does, it slows you down, it makes you mellow. Could 
13 that have been, you assumed he was slow because you 
14 didn't know whether or not he had smoked, was there 
15 something that made you think he was slow versus 
16 high? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
A 
No, I just didn't feel he was high. 
Okay. 
At the time. 
20 It was just the 
21 impression you got at the time, he was slow and not 
22 high at the time? 
23 A I mean, he may have been, I would just 
24 assume, I'm assuming that he was slow too, but 
25 that's the first impression that I got from him is

1 that he was slow and came outside, seen me working 
2 and wanted to talk to somebody. 
3 Okay. And I have a 
4 question about you said in your statement on the 
5 18th of August that you were working at and 
6 then today you indicated that you were working 
7 and So I'm wanting to verify where you were 
8 when you saw this? 
9 A When he got back with the machine, he 
10 started right here, he dug the first scoop, took the 
11 second scoop right there and the third one right 
12 over here, and then got off, parked the machine and 
13 
14 
15 
my truck was parked right there. (indicating) 
And where were you? 
A After the first pop, I was right there 
16 cleaning the loose stuff out of the hole. 
17 So you don't think you

19 
20 
21 
ever were working at ?

Right.

22 working right there.

24 working there to begin with and then you moved over

1 A All we were doing, he would come through 
2 with the bucket, pop it in the ground and scoop a 
3 little out. I clean the loose stuff out and we add 
4 a little piece of pipe to it to get it further away 
5 from the building. 
6 Can I ask you how fast 
7 those Mustangs go? 
8 A Five to seven miles an hour. 
9 How far is it from where 
10 you were to where his truck was? 
11 A He parked here and he had to go out this 
12 way. I don't know how far that is. (indicating) 
13 A little bit ago you said 
14 maybe two or three minutes. If it goes at the very 
15 most 5 miles an hour, it would have been probably at 
16 least five minutes, right? 
A I don't know. 17 
18 Okay. That's okay, I'm 
19 just trying figure out what happened. 
20 A I know by the time he got over there with 
21 the machine, I already had the pipes out of my truck 
22 and put away so he could just park that and get 
23 right into his car. 
24 I have another question.

1 No, he had his hands up, he was just kind of taking 
2 the shots, this is on page four. And then they 
3 asked, and once he was empty, then the bad cop 
pulled his gun and just staggered forward and 
dropped to his face.

5 
6 In this interview you say you saw Michael 
7 drop to his face, but today you say didn't see, you 
8 saw him leave, you didn't see Michael drop to his 
9 face, correct? 
10 A I saw Michael laying on the ground, so I 
11 assume that he fell on his face. 
12 So you didn't see him 
13 drop to his face? 
14 A I didn't see him fall. When I came around 
15 and gave that kid a card, I could see him laying on 
16 his face. 
17 When you said I think he 
18 was dead on his feet and just fell forward, that was 
19 an assumption?

4 In the media interview and today, you 
5 mention that the cop had his gun drawn and was 
6 walking backward. I'm just trying to figure out was 
7 me stopped? 
8 A He had it down and was walking toward him. 
9 He started shooting at about 10 feet or so. 
10 Okay. 
11 A By the time he stopped shooting was about 
12 6, 7 feet, 8 feet. 
13 When you talked here and 
14 said he was backing up. 
15 A I was doing a lot of assuming apparently 
16 from what I'm learning today. 
17 I don't blame you, I 
18 assume all the time, but I'm just --
19 A When he stopped shooting, that's when they 
20 started backing up.

22 after he stopped shooting?
