11 WITNESS 10: Because afterwards the 
12 gunshot, there was a gunshot, one gunshot, and he --
13 he ran off.

15 please correct me if I'm saying anything that even 
16 remotely doesn't reflect what you're saying, I just 
17 want to make sure I understand, okay? 
18 You see him in the car, you can't 
19 necessarily tell what's going on, but after hearing 
20 the gunshot and you seeing him run off, you make an 
21 assumption that there's some sort of confrontation 
22 or conflict inside the car, right? 
A Yes. 23 
24 DETECTIVE Okay. So how, roughly

Was the officer saying anything to him? 
I didn't hear the officer say anything to 
3 him, I didn't hear conversation from either party. 
4 Q Okay. So we know you were like from this 
5 distance to that distance and can anybody give an 
6 estimate of how far that would be? 
7 About 20 feet. 
8 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Now, from the officer, 
9 how far was the officer from Michael Brown when 
10 Michael Brown turned around and raised his hands, 
11 the same, a similar distance or something different? 
12 A Similar distance because I was closer to 
13 the officer than I was to Michael when he turned 
14 around. 
15 Q Okay. So that's Michael 20 feet away or 
16 so, I'm the officer, let's say, just for purposes of 
17 the transcript.

A 
Q 
Did Michael Brown ever move back or come 
Like he came forward. 
He came forward. Did he come forward in a 
7 charging motion? 
8 A No, like he just went forward like his 
9 body was just going down and he was shooting him.

13 
14 
A 
Q 
A

You didn't think --
No, he wasn't coming towards him whenever 
15 he turned around. He just start like, as soon as he 
16 turned around like, that's whenever like the bullets 
17 start hitting him. I can't say exactly where, but 
18 he just started going down from that point.

5 when he was going down you said the officer was 
6 shooting at him? 
7 A When he went down, he went down to the

9 
ground like this. (indicating) 
Q Okay. And from your perspective, in your 
10 opinion, you didn't think that the officer was ever, 
11 his life was not threatened? 
12 A I can't say, before I pulled up to this 
13 car, I can't say what happened before I got there. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Right. 
So I don't know what happened between them 
16 before I pulled up, but I can only say what I saw. 
17 From what I saw, he was trying to get away, he was 
18 pulling away at the window. 
19 Q Okay. And you saw it from the time that 
20 he ran from the car window until he laid dead on the 
21 ground? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And between that timeframe, he never 
24 appeared, in your opinion, to be threatening the 
25 officer?
