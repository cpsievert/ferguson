Fear, I didn't want to get involved. 
And, in fact, you never came forward to

7 MS. WHIRLEY: I see, okay.

9 everything that was going on at that time up there,

GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXI 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. It is 
1 
2 
3 Monday, November lOth. It is about 9:30 in the 
4 morning. This is Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is 
5 here and all 12 grand jurors are here, as well as 
6 , the court reporter. 
7 We started this morning with a 
8 conversation that was not on the record, but someone 
9 from the prosecutor's office has talked to the grand 
10 jurors about their concerns for security, safety and 
11 giving you some tips on how to be secure and safe 
12 from here on out. 
13 I will stress again it is my 100, 
14 110 percent sure that your identities will never be 
15 released by this office or by the courts. I'm aware 
16 that some of you are concerned that, you know, your 
17 identities might be discovered by people in the 
18 media or others, you know. We're doing our best 
19 that you are safe and secure after your service here 
20 no matter what your decision. And so that took up a 
21 little bit of time this morning. 
22 
23 
So we are getting started this morning. 
have Sergeant first, he's with the Ferguson 
24 Police Department, and he is in charge of their 
25 communications.

1 I will tell you that last week we had 
2 quite a bit of conversation, not conversation, 
3 testimony and evidence regarding radio 
4 communications, and regarding the county RIOT A 
5 channel. 
6 I will tell you that after our last 
7 meeting, I think we met last Thursday was when we 
8 were last here, I have discovered that channel three 
9 is not the RIOT A channel in Ferguson. 
10 So working under that assumption that it 
11 was, and there was some talk about having a map and 
12 so forth. 
13 You remember who was here 
14 and testified, he's with county communications. He 
15 did a map for me that has the location of all of the 
16 county's voting receivers, you remember those ones 
17 that pick up the RIOT A channel. 
18 There's also on the map where the Ferguson 
19 receiver is in relation to where the officer was, so 
20 I will hand out these maps. 
21 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 85 
22 marked for identification.) 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: I've marked my copy as 
24 Grand Jury Number 85. Mine is not in color. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
There's a legend on this map that says

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXI November 13, 2014 
Page 7 
1 that incident. Okay. So he describes on the map 
2 incident and that would be what happened on 
3 Canfield. The location of where the incident 
4 occurred, okay. 
5 And if you will look on the map, there's 
6 actually a little police car and that's on the map, 
7 that's him marking where the incident occurred on 
8 Canfield. 
9 So in this legend it says, incident to 
10 Ferguson received, the main receiver at Ferguson 
11 Police Department is 1.57 miles from the place of 
12 the incident to the receiver. 
13 So I'll pass those around. But my 
14 understanding now is that the RIOT A channel might 
15 not be relevant to our, to what you guys are looking 
16 at. Maybe it was informative, but we are going to 
17 have Sergeant talk about the Ferguson 
18 communications and how that works and what exactly, 
19 what channel is what and so forth, okay. So I will 
20 go get him and get started.

11 charge of communications, that would be 911 calls?

Page 13 
Yes. 
And so does each officer have his own car 
3 to take home? 
4 A No, ma'am. The only ones that have their 
5 own cars are resident officers that live in town 
6 that have their own car. The only thing they don't 
7 have in those resident cars are computers. 
8 Everything else is set up the same. 
9 Q So we've seen pictures and heard testimony

Q 
A 
Q 
So the Tahoes are newer? 
Yes, they are. 
And so Officer Wilson's car had a mobile 
21 radio and then it also had a computer in it; is that 
22 right? 
23 A Yes, it is. 
24 Q And you said that the resident officer, 
25 people who live in the city limits get to take a car

Page 14 
Yes, ma'am. 
But they don't have computers? 
No. 
Was Darren Wilson a resident officer? 
No, ma'am. 
7 Q So when you are done with your shift as an 
8 officer, if you're not a resident officer, you take 
9 your car back to the station and then get your 
10 personal car and go home? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then is that vehicle put back in 
13 service like on the next shift? 
14 A Yes, it is. 
15 Q Okay. Urn, so each car has a number; is 
16 that right? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 Q And so when a radio in a car calls out, 
19 can the dispatcher tell by the signal which car it 
20 is? 
21 A No, ma'am. The only time you can tell 
22 which vehicle it is if the alert tone is sounded, 
23 that's the emergency alert tone. It will come up 
24 with what they call an alias on the screen and that 
25 will tell which vehicle it is so that dispatcher is

1 aware. 
2 Q And so we already heard some testimony 
3 about the alert tone, and that's the orange button 
4 that's on the mobile, the portable; is that right? 
A Yes, ma'am, it is this button. 5 
6 Q There's an orange alert button also on the 
7 mobile radio inside the car, correct? 
A Yes, there is. 8 
9 Q And so if an officer activates that alert 
10 button, can the dispatcher tell what radio it is by 
11 his car 108? 
12 A Yes, ma'am. 
13 Q And, obviously, each officer has their own 
14 radio, they would know whose radio it is? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q If it is a portable? 
17 A Yes. It comes up on a screen with their 
18 name and also the radio number. 
19 Q Okay. And then you also told me that it 
20 would say M, for mobile or P, is there P for 
21 portable? 
22 A That's on the new system for the cars. If 
23 the cars, the alias will come up with the last 
24 letter M is for mobile. When we switch over to the 
25 new radio system, that will still be with a P for

2 Q We heard some talk about the County 
3 installing or putting in place this new 800 
4 megahertz radio communication system; is that right? 
A Yes, ma'am. 5 
6 Q But you are not apart of that yet? 
7 A Not yet. 
8 Q So the radio system that you are using 
9 today, is that the same radio system that was in 
10 place on August 9th? 
A Yes, ma'am. 11 
12 Q So everything that we're talking about so
