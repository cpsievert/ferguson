8 A I seen him get inside, but as I said, I 
9 didn't see him like make a conversation with the 
10 person that was in. I know when I got to the

12 MS. ALIZADEH: Right. You got to the 
13 ground after it was all over? 
A Yeah. 14 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: I guess my question is,

3 A Yeah. 
4 Did it to your, I guess, 
5 your opinion, did it ever seem like he was trying to 
6 tackle this officer? 
7 A No, huh-uh, no, not at all. It just 
8 looked like, the moment I come outside, I just 
9 thought he was hit, you know, in the stomach 
10 somewhere and he was going down, that's my vision 
11 right there. Oh, he's going down and then boom, 
12 boom, boom, he's down for sure. And, you know, I 
13 just knew he was dead the moment, I think, yeah, 
14 probably like the very last shot is when like I seen 
15 his face. 
16 Cause, urn, after all of them shots, I 
17 didn't see no blood like splatter until like his 
18 face hit the ground, so I thought his head busted up

1 first point that you saw him? 
2 WITNESS 10: The first point was I seen 
3 him with the suspect when they were still alive 
4 together. The next time I seen him was when after 
5 everything already took place where Mr. Brown was 
6 fatally injured and he came from nowhere and ran 
7 across the street and it would be at the point where 
8 he ran across would be in front of the squad car. 
9 
10 
DETECTIVE Okay. 
WITNESS 10: And he cuts across and yells, 
11 uh, "they killed him, they killed him." And I'm not 
12 sure if he, at that point when he was yelling at 
13 the, urn, that, blue Monte Carlo was at the same, 
14 they were at the same point. I'm not sure if he was 
15 yelling it just to be yelling it or if he was 
16 telling them in the car that they killed him. 
17 And that --and that he never entered 
18 their car or went up to that car that they killed 
19 him. He was yelling and he ran through the back 
20 fields of Canfield.

22 anybody else outside? You made mention obviously of

WITNESS 10: I'm not sure. If I had to 
guess, maybe late , early 
4 DETECTIVE All right. What, urn, 
5 what is your opinion of that incident itself? 
6 WITNESS 10: Initially, urn, I thought wow, 
7 urn, did he have to use the force on him. Urn, could 
8 he have taken and retrieved his taser, urn and tased 
9 the young guy. He was, I felt like he was unarmed 
10 and my initial thoughts was that. 
11 And after thinking about it and reviewing 
12 everything and putting myself in the police 
13 officer's shoes, I feel like he handled the 
14 situation correct force wise. The gunshot led from 
15 the car, the confrontation led from the car. 
16 He came out with his weapon drawn, urn, 
17 trying to pursue the suspect. 
18 Then, urn, at one point the suspect turns 
19 and if he, I felt he was really trying to give 
20 himself up, urn, the police officer already has his 
21 gun drawn. If you're really trying to give himself 
22 up, you're going to lay down on the ground and 
23 you're going to let it be known, urn, but that he 
24 didn't do that. 
25 And he charged at him and at that time I
