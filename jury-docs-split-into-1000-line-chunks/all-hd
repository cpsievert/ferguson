18 A Urn, I guess it was like he stopped and he 
19 turned around like this, and then he started moving 
20 towards the officer and kind of looked like he 
21 picked up a little bit of speed, and then he started 
22 going down. 
23 He was holding his chest when he went 
24 down, his hands was up here on his chest.

6 A He was a little bit more than 8 feet from 
7 the officer when he turned around. 
8 Q So when he stopped and turned around, did 
9 the officer continue to run toward him or did he 
10 stop or did he move in a direction? 
11 A There was a point where the officer 
12 stopped running after him. I think he had stopped 
13 by the time he turned around and was just standing 
14 in one spot. 
15 Q Now, when the officer took off running 
16 after Michael Brown, until Michael Brown stopped and 
17 turned around, did you hear or see the officer fire

I thought he was. 
And so now yesterday you learned from the 
14 people that were talking to you that there's no 
15 injury to Michael Brown's hip or leg, at least a 
16 gunshot injury, correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q So does that make you rethink about what 
19 you saw, them telling you that? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. It made me think I really 
21 don't know what was going on. He made body 
22 movements which made me believe that he was shot in

Q And so what do you do? 
A I'm a criminal investigator. I'm 
assigned, I work for the prosecutor's office. I'm 
4 assigned to a team of attorneys to assist them in 
5 their investigations and to fill in from time to 
6 time with other attorneys as is needed. 
7 Q Am I am one of your attorneys that you 
8 assist in my cases? 
A You are. 9 
10 Q Okay. And you've been doing that for 
11 quite a while? 
A Thirteen years. 12 
13 Q All right. And so ever since, well, 
14 shortly after I got this investigation, I from time 
15 to time have asked you to help me with things or do 
16 things in regard to this grand jury investigation; 
17 is that right? 
18 
19 
A I've been given assignments, yes. 
Q And one of the things that you have been 
20 helping me with all this time is to arrange for 
21 witnesses, their transportation, meeting them 
22 downstairs, getting them upstairs, you had to run 
23 out and get lunch or food for witnesses in the past, 
24 so that's one of the things I've asked you to help 
25 me do; is that right?

13 was a special request or something special about the 
14 two of them being transported here? 
15 A Right, the mother was and had 
16 So we had to deal with trying to get 
17 transportation to assist her primarily in getting 
18 her and her son in here. 
19 Q So we were looking at whether or not we 
20 had to get a special van, or whether she could come 
21 in a regular cab and you were looking into that for 
22 me; is that right? 
23 A Van, Call A Ride, Metro, just a number of 
24 different possibilities and how to set that up and 
25 how to make the arrangement.

13 A You relayed that information to me, yes. 
14 Q Okay. And you and I and Sheila Whirley 
15 had discussions and have had discussions in the past 
16 about whether or not if witnesses say they didn't 
17 see anything when they previously had made a 
18 statement that they saw something, whether or not we 
19 were going to bring that witness anyway and testify?
