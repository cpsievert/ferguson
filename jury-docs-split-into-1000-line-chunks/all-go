Does she have any experience being a

19 A Yes. She was a supervisor at East Central

21 Q So she has got a lot of experience as a 
22 dispatcher too, would that be fair to say? 
23 A Yes.

And then do both dispatchers dispatch

12 
A

Yes. 
And then what about the CAD calls, we have

18 things?

And we've also heard testimony that on a

So at the beginning of your shift, do you

Q 
Call sign. 
Call sign. Do you get a roster with call 
7 signs and whose working that day? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so when an officer calls out and he's 
10 on the dispatch channel and he's in his vehicle in 
11 his car, generally can you hear that call? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are there times when it is difficult to 
14 hear that call? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Are there times when officers will walk 
17 over each other and walk on each other and they're 
18 both making calls at the same time? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then what about the portable radios, 
21 is it sometimes difficult to hear when an officer 
22 makes a call on a portable radio? 
23 A Yes. 
24 Q And are you aware that the portable radio 
25 has 5 watts and that the mobile radio is a 10 watt

A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so would it be fair to say that the 
4 portable radios have a weaker signal? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, for the amount of time that you have 
7 been working for Ferguson, do you recognize 
8 generally the voices of the different officers that 
9 are calling in? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
The older officers, yes. 
And so we've heard these transmissions, 
12 you and I listened to them today; is that right? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q You identified a lot of the officers, in 
15 fact, all of the ones that we were listening to 
16 between yourself and Sergeant , you were able to 
17 tell me who was who when they were talking; is that 
18 right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then also were you aware that I had a 
21 transcript where someone previously has attempted to 
22 transcribe what's being said in these calls, did you 
23 see me make changes on it? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. 
There would be times where you could tell

1 me what was being said when I couldn't really hear 
2 it? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Now, you and I talked about that, about 
5 the ability of a dispatcher with your experience to 
6 understand what's being said when someone like me 
7 might listen to the call and say, okay, I didn't get 
8 that or I can't hear what's being said. Is that 
9 something that just comes with years of experience? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And also, you also talked about, in fact, 
12 you talked about certain officers having a certain 
13 way of speaking. 
14 A Yes, some of them do. 
15 Q And one of the officers you said I can 
16 tell that's him, he'll always have a pause in his 
17 voice, like stops mid sentence and then completes a 
18 sentence? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And you also said there is one officer who 
21 has got kind of a southern twang to his voice? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And did you also describe for me that you 
24 can also tell by the tone of the officer's voice 
25 whether or not he's, he may be excited or there's a

A 
Q 
Page 91 
Right. 
Now, when the officers are out on patrol, 
4 are they supposed to notify you where they are and 
5 what they are up to at all times? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q So if an officer is on a call, when he 
8 finishes that call, does he call in and tell you 
9 he's done with the call? 
A Yes. 
Q And how does he do that? 
10 
11 
12 A He radios in using his call sign and let's 
13 us know that he's 10-8.

10-8?

So that's 10-8? 
Yes, ma'am. 
That means I've completed that call and 
19 I'm back in service, I'm ready for another call? 
20 A Yes. 
21 Q So are there other things like bathroom 
22 breaks, I'm going on dinner break where they might 
23 use different codes?

1 transcript the officer will hear, will actually call 
2 in and then the dispatcher might repeat what the 
3 officer says; is that right? 
4 A Yes. 
Q Why do you do that? 5 
6 A To insure that all of the other officers 
7 hear what the transmission just was because 
8 sometimes the radio don't transmit and also to 
9 insure to that officer that I'm clear on what he 
10 said. 
11 Q Okay. And so if somebody calls in to 
12 dispatch and says something generally if everything 
13 is working properly and everything is good to go, 
14 the other officers are on the dispatch channel can 
15 hear that call, correct?

1 Q Do you know how many watts the transmitter 
2 is for dispatch? 
3 A That I do not know. 
4 Q Is your transmitter stronger than the 
5 mobile and portable transmitters? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q So generally speaking, the officers are 
8 always going to be, usually going to be able to hear 
9 dispatch, correct? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q And we've also heard a lot of stuff about 
12 dead zones and that would be where officers might 
13 not be able to transmit or receive calls, correct? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Are there times when you can hear that 
16 there's an officer keying up a mike, in other words, 
17 he's pressing the button on his mike, but you don't 
18 hear speaking? 
19 
20 
21 
A

And can you tell that that's a call?

22 hear what they're saying.

1 you know these guys' voices, is there anything on 
2 your monitor that tells you who is calling in? 
3 A No. 
4 Q So you only know by his voice or if he 
5 gives his call sign? 
6 A That is correct. 
7 Q You also, we talked today, can you tell 
8 the difference when an officer is calling in on a 
9 portable versus his mobile? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q And what's the difference, how do you tell 
12 the difference? 
13 A The portable is not as strong and is 
14 clearer. A lot of times when they're on their 
15 portable you can hear static in the background 
16 whereas on the car radio, it is usually very crisp 
17 and clear. 
18 Q Okay. Now, we're going to play the 
19 transmissions and pass around the transcript. And I 
20 will tell you that the change, the handwriting 
21 that's on the transcript is mine. And I did that 
22 because it was, I first met with her this morning at

1 you would tell me sometimes when it would say on the 
2 transcript UI, which I assumes mean unintelligible, 
3 you are able to tell me what's being said sometimes? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q You saw me making changes, and sometimes 
6 with the officer it doesn't say who the officer was. 
7 You are able to tell me, well, that's 24 or that's 
8 25 or whatever?

And we talked about today on that day who

A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. All right. Before we start playing 
14 the radio calls, is there anybody has a question 
15 about her job, or anything that she's testified to 
16 so far? 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: I actually do, not much, but 
18 hi, I'm over here. You mentioned that sometimes you 
19 could only hear static when an officer is trying to 
20 call in, I guess that's a dead zone or something? 
21 A Could be. Usually when you hear static, 
22 it is because they're in a building or maybe there's 
23 a building between them or some type of large 
24 structure between them and the radio waves don't get 
25 through that as easily as they would if they were

1 out in the open. 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: I think I heard you say that 
3 you cannot tell who's trying to call in on your 
4 monitors when you hear that static; is that correct? 
5

A That's correct, you cannot. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is there anything in place 
7 to try to figure out, you know, who the officer is 
8 or what to do in case an officer might be needing 
9 help. 
10 A We have panic buttons that are installed 
11 in all of their walkies and also on the car radio. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Is that that orange alert 
13 button we have heard about? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. If they push that, my radio 
15 console lights up and makes a lot of noise and each 
16 console does that, so we each have to shut them 
17 down. One of them did not shut them all down and 
18 that shows the officer's name, it shows whether he's 
19 on his portable or shows whether he's on his mobile 
20 in his car.

1 and you just hear static, there is nothing you can 
2 do to try to figure out who that officer is or they 
3 need help? 
4 A Other than asking him to repeat, no, 
5 ma'am. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you said you also 
7 can detect a problem in the officer's voice, I think 
8 you said that, right? 
A Yes. 9 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: What do you do if you detect 
11 a problem, like something is going on and the 
12 officer is not asking for help, you detect 
13 something, what do you do? 
14 A I usually when there's a change in their 
15 voice, I usually send them help regardless, I send 
16 assist units. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: You ask them do you need 
18 additional help?

1 is How often do the officers use that alert 
2 button, have you been known to happen a lot or? 
3 A It doesn't happen that often. I would 
4 even say once a month. It doesn't happen that 
5 often, but it does happen especially it is more an 
6 accident than not, but they'll hit it.

1 911 calls. Those might not be in sync, would that 
2 be fair to say? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the clock that 
5 records these calls as they are being made might not 
6 be the actual time of the call, would that be fair 
7 to say?

A 
Q 
Yes, there could be a discrepancy. 
Okay. But would it be also be fair to say 
10 that if there's a call that say 11:53 and 15 seconds 
11 and then the next call is at 11:54 and 15 seconds, 
12 that there would be a minute between those two 
13 calls, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q So we can tell how much lag time in 
16 between calls by looking at the time, but that 
17 doesn't necessarily reflect what the actual time is? 
18

Q 
Correct.

I'm clear means I understand it and I'm 
Yes. 
Doesn't mean I'm going out of service or 
No. 
Okay. And then Officer 22 says 22, I'm 
Correct. 
And so 22 was not originally called by 
Correct. 
He heard the call? 
Yes. 
And so he says I'm going too? 
Yes, because when she put that out, she 
17 put that out for a unit and one to assist. 
18 Q Okay. And is that because of the nature

saying that? 
Yes. 
And what does that mean? 
He, in our CAD system when we enter a 
5 call, they can see everything that we enter into the 
6 computer. And sometimes there is a time delay when 
7 we're entering information into the call before we 
8 physically put the unit on that call. He may not 
9 have seen himself assigned to that call. So he was 
10 just inquiring that and I were clear, he was 
11 responding also. 
12 Q Okay. So says I'm going to 
13 assist her, I'm going to this call as well?
