1 apartment, or what did you do? 
2 A See, while it was going on, some people in 
3 my house heard the shots. So my girlfriend came out 
4 and was like, what's somebody shooting for. And she 
5 was like, urn, somebody shooting? I was telling her 
6 the situation and so she was like, is he dead? I 
7 was like, I don't know. Then she was looking at 
8 other people that was around, I guess they thought 
9 that he was dead. So we then walked down there and 
10 was like, and he was laying in the middle of the 
11 street. 
12 Q Did you ever see the officer who shot him, 
13 did you ever see that officer go down by the body? 
14 A Uh, no, I didn't see that. 
15 Q How about did you ever see the officer's 
16 truck, did it ever move? 
17 A No. 
18 Q So after this happened and the police 
19 came, the truck stayed there? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What about the body, other than when 
22 eventually, which I know was a long time, but 
23 eventually it was removed, but did you ever see 
24 anybody try to move the body?

1 Q Okay. Did you ever hear the officer 
2 saying anything or yelling or anything like that? 
3 A No. 
4 Q How about did you ever hear anybody else, 
5 whether it was Mike Brown or the littler guy that 
6 was with him, did you hear anybody saying anything? 
7 A No. 
8 Q And when I ask that, I don't necessarily 
9 mean if you understood what was being said?

A 
Q 
I didn't hear anything. 
You just didn't hear any voices or 
12 screaming or anything? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Okay. And so, obviously, a lot of police 
15 arrived after that; is that right? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q And did you stay at the scene while the 
18 police were investigating? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
You didn't go up to the police on that day 
21 and tell them that you saw part of that; is that 
22 right? 
23 A No. 
24 Q And eventually some FBI agents knocked on 
25 your door and asked if you had seen something and

Q 
Yes. 
Is there anything else that you saw that 
7 you think is important or that maybe I haven't asked 
8 you that, let me ask you this, did you ever see 
9 anything in Michael Brown's hands? 
A No. 10 
11 Q How about the littler guy, did you ever 
12 see him hold anything? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Did you ever see anything fall or drop, 
15 being dropped from somebody? 
16 A No. 
17 Q Urn, did you ever see what became of the 
18 littler guy? 
19 A Urn, as the shooting is going on, like he 
20 hid behind the white car and then he tried to get in 
21 the white car, but then I guess they denied him. So 
22 he ran, I think, by then the officer was going 
23 towards Mike Brown. So he ran back behind the 
24 police car and ran behind right here and ran behind 
25 this building.

1 he was getting ready to run towards him, or 
2 whatever, I can't say the motions about. 
3 Q But he had his weapon up? 
4 A Not to say he got up pointing, I just know 
5 he got up and he was facing his direction. So I 
6 guess if he didn't get out like this, he got out, 
7 took a couple steps and then faced him. 
8 Q Well, did you see the officer facing 
9 Mike's back with his weapon drawn? 
10 A No, the officer was getting out of the car 
11 as Mike Brown was running. So once he got past the 
12 building where I couldn't see him no more, the 
13 officer is out of the car and then pointed in his

I do have a

19 during the altercation at the car, did you see a 
20 minivan pull into that parking lot right directly in 
21 front of where you had been sitting and someone get 
22 out of that minivan, or you see anybody pulling out 
23 of that lot during this time? 
24 A I think somebody tried to come that way 
25 and turned around. I remember seeing the white car

1 turn around in the street, but. 
2 Someone coming from that 
3 direction, coming from West Florissant that pulled 
4 into that lot? 
5 A I really can't say. I think it was a 
6 vehicle, I won't say that I know it was. 
7 This is I have a 
8 question about what Sheila was asking. I want to 
9 make sure the first time after the police officer 
10 got out of the car, the first shots that were fired, 
11 you could not see Mike Brown at that time? 
12 A Correct. 
13 So you don't know if his 
14 back was to the officer, you assume he was, he was 
15 running away?
