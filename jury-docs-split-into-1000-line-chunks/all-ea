17 had asked him could he put my nephews in the car 
18 because my mother came to come get my nephews and my 
19 sister, and my sister is pregnant now. So she 
20 couldn't carry them down the stairs, so he went and 
21 put them in the car and he came back upstairs and he 
22 asked me could he use my cell phone. 
23 Q Okay. Let me stop. Remember when we 
24 talked about assuming things, you only need to say 
25 what you know or saw, okay.

The vehicle was parked a little bit 
13 further up, and I didn't notice the vehicle until 
14 after I got outside and got to the bottom of the 
15 steps and came outside. The vehicle was up a little 
16 bit, going towards West Florissant like it had came 
17 from the other way. 
18 Q Okay. So let's stop there. So you said 
19 that you didn't notice the vehicle until you came

1 A I didn't say they were right next to the 
2 vehicle, now I remember saying that, but I didn't 
3 say they were right next to the vehicle. I said 
4 they was parked a couple feet away from him, but it 
5 wasn't right next to him, like it was going towards 
6 West Florissant.

12 A

But if he was right here, I couldn't

15 Brown until I got all the way to the bottom of the

18 was next to the vehicle and you helped them draw the

1 Q Okay. You saw Mike Brown leave your 
2 apartment that day, when you looked out and saw him, 
3 can you recognize that that was Mike Brown? 
4 A Yes, the reason why I recognize it was 
5 Mike Brown is because, first off, I didn't know 
6 nobody that big was that young. Like he had been 
7 that big since we have been freshman. So that's 
8 another reason why I knew it was him. 
9 The second reason why I knew it was 
10 him, I recognize him by his socks and his khaki 
11 pants that he had on when he left my apartment. 
12 Q But with him kneeling down, you mean, you 
13 weren't getting a full body view of him? 
14 A But his legs were long and him on his 
15 knees and his back was towards me, I could see the 
16 lower half of his body.

He didn't have a hat on. 
Did you see the hat at all when you looked 
No, I didn't see the hat until I actually 
11 got there close enough to see everything. 
12 Q So when you saw him kneeling down, he was 
13 wearing what you remember he was wearing what he had 
14 on, but no hat? 
15 A Yes, he had on a gray T-shirt, he had on 
16 some khaki shorts, he had on some marijuana socks, 
17 they were yellow with green marijuana leafs on it, 
18 and he had on some white and black Nike flip flops. 
19 Q Now, this is one of those things I want to 
20 make sure that this is what you remember seeing as 
21 opposed to, like that day, as opposed to after you 
22 got down to the scene. 
23 You remember that's what he had on?

25 when he left my apartment that day.

5 that night? 
6 A She was in the bed, I don't think she was 
7 doing too much, she was pregnant so, she wasn't 
8 really doing too much moving around at the time. 
9 Q So, you know, , one of the things I'm 
10 wanting to kind of figure out is if your memory of 
11 what he was wearing is based upon the fact that you 
12 saw him down at the scene when you went down there 
13 as opposed to what you really remember that he had 
14 on the night before? 
15 A I know exactly what he had on cause he 
16 didn't change clothes because he couldn't get into 
17 his grandmother's house to get more clothes, cause 
18 that's where his clothes and belongings were at. 
19 Only thing he had brought to my house was some 
20 stereo speakers and his laptop.

22 two weeks he was staying at your house?

10 A I was out of the apartment. As soon as I 
11 hit the front door and got onto the balcony I heard, 
12 at least, I say about three to four shots. It was 
13 like a pause of me running down the steps, and then 
14 when I got to the end of the steps I heard several 
15 more shots.

I guess Dorian and Michael Brown. 
Remember, don't guess. 
When I ran out of the house, I ran over to 
4 the grass hill, people were out there crying and 
5 yelling. I was just like, they just kill my home 
6 boy for nothing, those were my exact words. 
7 Q Did you see Dorian Johnson when you were 
8 out there? 
9 A No, I didn't see him until I say about 
10 five minutes later because I was more worried on 
11 going to go tell his family what happened, but by 
12 the time I tried to get down to his family's house, 
13 his uncle's girlfriend was already coming up the 
14 street. 
15 And I don't know if she heard about 
16 what had happened or if somebody had told her, but 
17 she was coming and running up the street. 
18 And I guess when she found out it was 
19 him, she broke down in tears. And then Dorian 
20 walked up to me and he started crying. And he was 
21 like sick to his stomach, so he honestly threw up in 
22 the parking lot. 
23 Q Okay. So let's back up a little bit. In

18 
Q 
A 
Who told you what happened? 
It was a neighbor, I don't honestly know 
19 his name. It was just a person I used to see. When 
20 he had got killt (sic) people thought it was me. 
21 People were thinking it was me. He just left out of 
22 here, he just left out of here. And that's what I 
23 was hearing as I was coming down the steps. 
24 Q Okay. So when you went down to the

I couldn't get that close. There's police 
5 right there by the time I got all the way down there 
6 enough to go to the scene when his family arrived, 
7 it was already, the tape was up and all that. So I 
8 had called my mother first, and then I had called my 
9 sister, and then I called my cousin and met up with 
10 my cousin. 
11 Q So by the time you got down like onto the 
12 ground level, the tape was already up? 
13 A No, not when I got down to the ground 
14 level. I didn't go close enough to his body. I 
15 stopped in the middle of the grass hill and I just 
16 broke down. 
17 Q Okay. So did you see the officers putting 
18 the tape up? 
19 A No, I honestly didn't. I was down trying 
20 to go tell his family what happened. I was talking 
21 to his auntie actually. 
22 Q Okay. Use the laser pointer for me and 
23 show me where you walked down to when you came down
