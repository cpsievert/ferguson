1 Q So after you saw the bigger guy running 
2 away from the police vehicle, what did the officer 
3 do? 
4 A He got out of his car and he had his left 
5 hand on his face and the gun in his right hand and 
6 when he stood up, he was wobbling from his left foot 
7 to his right foot. He said something, I don't know 
8 what he said. All I remember hearing is the word 
9 shoot. I didn't hear any other words before that. 
10 And he had his hand on his gun and he was pointing 
11 it right at the larger of the African-Americans. 
12 And after he said the word shoot, that's when the 
13 young man turned around.

1 Were you posting racist 
2 stuff before this incident? 
3 No, ma'am. 
4 So you have never made 
5 any kind of racist remarks? 
6 No, I've never posted on 
7 Facebook any racial remark. 
8 But you have made racist 
9 remarks? 
Yes, ma'am. I don't like to 10 
11 be considered racist. I try very hard. And I know 
12 for a fact my children are not, but does it sound 
13 with my language and my behavior that I am racist? 
14 Yes, ma'am, but it's not something I approve of, if 
15 that makes sense. 
16 Honestly, no, but that's 
17 okay. You were going to see an African-American 
18 friend, you said was a very good friend? 
19 Correct. 
20 The weeks following this 
21 incident, you didn't call her until the next day, 
22 but in your recorded statement you said that you 
23 called her that day to tell her that wouldn't be 
24 coming by. So which was it, you call her that day 
25 or the following day?

11 I wasn't remembering which 
12 way he told me to go. 
13 Okay. In the FBI 
14 statement you said you saw an apartment complex, you 
15 turned into the apartment complex because you 
16 thought maybe this was where you miraculously found 
17 out where your friend lived; is that right? 
18 No, I turned into, I turned 
19 left on that into there.

2 understand why that is? 
3 Because I don't make U turns 
4 in the middle of the street and I don't pull into 
5 people's driveway. 
6 Right, you said that, but

9 streets?

2 see in the car? 
3 I could not see the officer, 
4 no, because the larger of the two, the heavier set

12 witness' statements, about best way to proceed with 
13 that. And during our lunch break today, I'm going 
14 to do everything I can to make sure I have 
15 transcripts for statements. Some of our statements 
16 do not have transcripts. We have played some 
17 statements that we didn't have transcripts for and 
18 we may now have those transcripts as they have all 
19 been kind of getting done along the way. So I will
