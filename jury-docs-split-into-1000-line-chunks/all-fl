GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XVIII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. 
(Everyone says good morning.) 
November 3, 2014 
Page 5 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: It is Monday, November 3rd, 
5 it is 9:26 a.m. This is Kathi Alizadeh. Sheila 
6 Whirley is present as well, and all 12 grand jurors 
7 are here, as well as the court reporter, who's 
8 taking down and recording what is being said. 
9 Some matters that I wanted to discuss 
10 before we start with evidence today. I would like 
11 you all to give us some dates for next week. And, 
12 you know, I had told you in the past that we are 
13 getting close to wrapping up, but you know, I don't 
14 know how long, you know, this is still going to last 
15 for sure and, of course, I don't know how long. We 
16 don't know how long you will need to deliberate. 
17 And so just go ahead and pick some dates 
18 for next week. If you could give us three days, 
19 that would be great. I understand, you know, with 
20 your schedules, you have to work around and we will 
21 work around those schedules. 
22 A couple of other matters is the floor 
23 plan with no door, remember the floor plan? So I 
24 had Detective talk to the gal, the leasing 
25 agent and she drew the door in here. They didn't

1 change it other than she drew a little line where 
2 the door is on these second two bedroom version. 
3 And then she also wrote next to the marks, which 
4 would indicate a window, she wrote sliding door. 
5 These are new, I don't know if you all got 
6 rid of the old ones that I've given you. If you 
7 haven't, go ahead, and you want to give those to me 
8 and I will shred them so we don't get those 
9 confused. That's your newest version of that. 
10 So, for the record, I had previously 
11 marked that floor plan as Exhibit Number, Grand Jury 
12 Exhibit Number 51. I'm going to remark the new one 
13 that shows the door, as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
14 51. And I'm going to tear up the old one so we 
15 don't get those confused. I'm just using the same 
16 number, I just replace it with the accurate version. 
17 And then so we have the week scheduled out 
18 pretty busy, hopefully we're going to be chugging 
19 along here and trying to get some of these witnesses 
20 in and out. 
21 We talked about you all seeing the 
22 vehicle. We actually had a plan, we were going to 
23 try to do that today, we have now discovered because 
24 I had, I don't know if I was told this or I don't 
25 recall who even told me, I had believed that Officer

1 Wilson's vehicle was back in service and the door 
2 had been repaired and it was back on the road being 
3 used as a police car in Ferguson. 
4 But last week we learned that it is not 
5 repaired and it is still missing the door. So we 
6 can't really have somebody drive it down here. It 
7 would draw too much attention if that was driving 
8 around like that. 
9 So I have a couple of options for you. We 
10 could have the vehicle towed to a location where the 
11 new call center is. There is a secure garage in 
12 there. We could have the vehicle towed there and 
13 then we could have you all, depending on the time of 
14 day we do this. If we do it at the end of the day, 
15 you all take your own vehicles out there, then you 
16 could leave directly from there rather than coming 
17 back to Clayton, or if necessary, we could get a van 
18 and take you all out there together to see it. 
19 Of course, then we'd have to bring you 
20 back here to get your vehicles, so that is an 
21 option. If you want to see the actual Ferguson 
22 vehicle. 
23 The limitations with that are going to be 
24 that the door is not on the car. And we have the 
25 door and I can throw the door in the back of the

Page 8 
1 truck and you all can look at the door, but it is 
2 not going to be on the car. 
3 And so depending on what you want to see, 
4 it might be a better option for you if I could get a 
5 Ferguson Tahoe, same year and same model and 
6 everything, and that way you would have a complete 
7 truck, in other words. 
8 I will also tell you that I had someone 
9 from the Crime Scene Unit go out and measure the 
10 actual truck, the actual Ferguson vehicle points 
11 like from the ground to the top, you know, the roof 
12 from the ground to this and so forth. So we do have 
13 actual measurements if those are important to you, 
14 we'll give those to you as well. 
15 So maybe during your lunch break today you 
16 can talk about whether or not, if we just get a 
17 lookalike Ferguson truck, we can do that here, we 
18 had previously talked about doing that in the 
19 sallyport here which is where prisoners are brought 
20 in so they are automatic doors, it is secured, we 
21 would be able to have that area for 30 minutes. 
22 It is monitored by cameras because it has 
23 to be, but we've arranged that the cameras would be 
24 shut off so nobody is going to be seeing you. 
25 Of course, no recordings will be made of

1 you while you are up around the vehicle. If we get 
2 the lookalike, we can do it here. If we are going 
3 to need the actual vehicle, we are going to have to 
4 make the arrangements to take you to another 
5 location to view that. So you can talk during your 
6 lunch break about what you want to do, or if you 
7 want to do both. If it is important that you see 
8 both, we'll do whatever, okay. 
9 How y'all doing, okay. I can't recall if 
10 there was any other things that needed to be talked 
11 about or brought up and if there are, yes. 
12 I saw on KSDK over the 
13 weekend, or I think late last week, that they 
14 indicated that Dr. who did the family 
15 autopsy had mentioned that he was willing to come 
16 and testify before us and also that there is 
17 reportedly some of his findings doesn't agree with 
18 our findings regarding some, I guess it is stippling 
19 or whatever. So I know you put it out there already 
20 inviting him to come at your request to come 
21 testify. 
22 I don't know if you've heard from him? 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: The latest is we are trying 
24 to get him here. He had not, still has not 
25 completed his report. And he indicated that he

Page 10 
1 needed a copy of the St. Louis County Medical 
2 Examiner's Report in order for him to complete his 
3 report, which is protocol, it is. 
4 And you will hear from medical examiners 
5 we are going to bring in that that's necessary 
6 because obviously when you are doing a second or 
7 third autopsy, things that were done previously, you 
8 need to know is this something that, you know, was 
9 caused or created in the autopsy or is this a 
10 different wound. And so it is not unusual and in 
11 fact, you know, I don't want to say protocol, I 
12 think that is the appropriate medical procedure is 
13 to have the previous autopsy reports so that you can 
14 know what was done previously. 
15 Obviously, the bullets were removed 
16 already and things that were done are not going to 
17 be seen in a second or third autopsy. 
18 So we have forwarded a copy of that to the 
19 appropriate people to get to him. And so we've also 
20 contacted the appropriate people to have him check 
21 his schedule, let us know when he might be 
22 available. 
23 Obviously, we can't wait if I'm not 
24 available until January, we're going to have to make 
25 a decision on what to do about that in the event

1 that happens. But yes, we have things in place 
2 right now where we are trying to get him to come 
3 here and testify for you. 
4 So that's being done and was there any 
5 other things that you guys wanted or needed that? 
6 I was going to 
7 see, we have learned a lot about Michael Brown 
8 through testimony. I still don't know a lot about 
9 Officer Darren Wilson. 
10 I know we brought his supervisor in 
11 briefly to talk about protocol, what happened that 
12 day. His story was very different from Darren 
13 Wilson's. Would be interested to know if we know 
14 about what his morning was like. 
MS. ALIZADEH: What? 15 
16 What his morning was like 
17 that day. History, you know, behavioral, awards, 
18 whatever that may be. I know a lot about Michael 
19 Brown, but not a lot about Darren Wilson. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: We have his personnel file 
21 and that is something we will get to you. Kind of 
22 our strategy here is once we get done with all of 
23 our eyewitnesses, then we are going to have some 
24 experts still testify. And then probably the last 
25 witness is going to be Detective

who is the

Page 12 
1 primary case officer on this. And so a lot of, some 
2 of that stuff is going to come in through him. 
3 But we talked about the fact that there 
4 may have been witnesses who testified earlier in the 
5 process that now that you know more than you did 
6 back then, you may wish us to recall some witnesses. 
7 As you know, we cannot compel Officer 
8 Wilson to testify. So all I could do is extend an 
9 invitation if you wanted him to come back. 
10 If anybody else that now you look at, you 
11 know, what you now know and you are comparing what 
12 the witness said previously. If you have additional 
13 questions for any witness who has already testified, 
14 just let us know and we will do our best to get them 
15 in here again. 
16 So we talked about that last week that you 
17 know, this whole thing began two months ago so and 
18 you've heard from, you know, what am I on now, how 
19 many witnesses have we had, 47. We have had 47 
20 
21 
witnesses. So it is a lot. 
So you guys can discuss that as well. If 
22 you want to recall any witnesses and again, it would 
23 be an invitation to Officer Wilson if you wanted to 
24 have him back. We would do what we can to get him 
25 here.

Other matters is that we have the taped 
statement of who testified last week 
3 and it is an hour and 26 minutes or so. And if you 
4 would like to hear that statement, we could play it. 
5 If you just want to get the transcript, I can pass 
6 that out to you, but that's something you can 
7 discuss during lunch as well if you want to hear her 
8 statement because we've got a witness here now so 
9 we're going to play some statements of that witness 
10 and then get her on the stand. 
11 And then when this is close to being 
12 concluded, Sheila and I are going to have to go 
13 through the notes and the transcripts to make sure 
14 that we've given you, we kind of got out of playing 
15 all the statements before the witness and, you know, 
16 we've proceeded with okay, we'll play those later. 
17 I want to make sure that we don't miss anything that 
18 there was a statement that we forgot to play or 
19 present to you. 
20 So we'll make sure we try to get that the 
21 boxes checked off to make sure you guys have heard 
22 everything. 
23 So at this time now we're going to play 
24 some recorded statements from a witness who we will 
25 identify as Witness Number 48.

1 We have transcripts for two statements. 
2 The first statement is ten minutes and 58 seconds. 
3 The second statement is a minute 35 seconds, which 
4 is just a phone call and then we have transcripts 
5 for those two. 
6 Then there is a third statement that is 22 
7 minutes and 32 seconds with no transcript for that 
8 since that was just done last week, and so I would 
9 ask that we'll go pause the recording while we are 
10 playing statements. , you do not need to 
11 transcribe the first two statements, but I would ask 
12 that you transcribe for the third one. 
13 So at this time, if you the want to pause 
14 that. 
15 So now that we're paused, I will tell you 
16 the two transcripts are together. 
17 A whole list of all the 
18 witnesses so we make sure that we have them also 
19 what you have. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Absolutely, I have been 
21 keeping track of that. 
22 The other thing is over the weekend I was 
23 trying to organize the exhibits and I'm still 
24 missing Number 48. So if anybody keeps track of the 
25 numbers.
