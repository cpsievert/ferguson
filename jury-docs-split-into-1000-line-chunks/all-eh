9 MS. WHIRLEY:

11 visualize your perspective but when the scene was 
12 kind of concluding. You are still sitting in the 
13 driver's seat of your car, when you are viewing, as 
14 you said, Officer Darren Wilson, you said he's got 
15 his gun aimed, you can see his back, are they 
16 perfectly lined up, are they off to an angle, what's 
17 your perspective? 
18 A I can't understand, what's that. 
19 I'm trying to understand 
20 your perspective of what you saw from your car right 
21 as the scene was concluded. I'm going to guess you 
22 can see the back of Officer Darren Wilson, but are 
23 they standing at an angle, are they perfectly lined 
24 up, I guess, what is your perspective?

2 The very end of the scene. 
3 A The very end of the scene? 
4 Yeah. You said you could 
5 see Officer Darren Wilson's back, but you were also 
6 stating that you could that he see him shot in the 
7 head, or you assume he shot him in the head. I'm 
8 just trying to understand was that at an angle to 
9 where he could see the front of Michael Brown and 
10 the back of Officer Darren Wilson. Were they 
11 straight on, what was your angle from your 
12 perspective with respect to the vehicle? 
13 A No, he was, whatever the officer name, he 
14 was facing toward this way now on his intercom or 
15 whatnot. 
16 So you could see Officer 
17 Darren Wilson's back? 
18 A No, I couldn't. After everything is over 
19 and Mr. Brown is on the ground, I see his face, back 
20 side. 
21 You understand what I'm 
22 saying? 
23 Yeah, I do 
24 understand what you are saying. I think you say you 
25 could see Michael Brown turn around.

12 When he shot him while he 
13 was laying on the ground? 
14 A No, while he shot him while he was laying 
15 on ground he's facing towards me. 
16 So how did he get from 
17 facing Michael Brown and watching him fall, he 
18 walked forward and shot him on the ground, how did 
19 the officer's face get towards you, did he walk 
20 around the body? 
21 A Yes, he was just proceeding around the 
22 body and got on his intercom, yes. 
23 So he was walking around 
24 Michael Brown's body and then he shot him after he 
25 walked around the body?

19 and all about how they, how everything was off. I 
20 try to push myself to actually concentrate on what 
21 actually, how many shots was actually fired.

Other people in the complex. 
How did they know that you knew anything? 
Some people was on the porch, I guess, and 
15 some people I heard yelling out there. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: There may be more questions. 
17 I just want to ask you, is there anything you want 
18 us to know as far as this investigation goes that 
19 you think is important to know and, you know, if you 
20 want to change anything that you said, we need the 
21 truth. We're not going to hold it against you at 
22 this point, we want to know what really happened.

1 A No, ma'am. I'm just here to give you all

A No, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Other questions? 
MS. ALIZADEH: So just basically, 
9 , you're saying that you changed your 
10 recollection of how things happened after the feds 
11 told you it couldn't have happened the way you 
12 originally described it, is that fair to say? 
13 A Yes, that's when I went and try to 
14 actually go on what I remember. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And so now your memory has 
16 changed? 
17 A No, I'm remembering what I'm telling you 
18 now. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: You told three different 
20 stories in the time we've been here today. So I 
21 want to know which one is really your memory or did 
22 you see this at all? 
23 A Yes, see, this is one of the reasons why I 
24 didn't want to get involved because now I feel like, 
25 y'all taking me as liar when I'm not and I was

1 there. I'm going to say once again, I know I was 
2 there, I can only remember so much of what I'm 
3 telling you. Whether that was two, three different 
4 stories, I'm only going on so much that I can 
5 remember. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: But you today said that the 
7 reason that you changed your story today? 
8 A Is because the FBI say my forensic science 
9 wasn't right. So that's why I went back and try to 
10 actually remember what I saw. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So what is your memory 
12 today, what is it? Were there nine shots, were 
13 there ten shots, were there three? 
14 
15 
A It wasn't nine, ten shots. 
MS. ALIZADEH: What do you remember 
16 happening as you sit here today, how many gunshots 
17 did you hear?

19 shot leaving the vehicle, so when he got hit on the

19 I just want to 
20 proceed if you can provide any more context to that 
21 statement you made right there at the end that he 
22 wasn't a threat. You shared it with the officer, 
23 you shared it with Michael Brown's mother, what 
24 specifically was it that you personally that day

17 
18 
A Before I was able to approach them, yes. 
Okay. When you saw the 
19 struggle going on even though there were no cars 
20 between you, you were four or five car lengths away?
