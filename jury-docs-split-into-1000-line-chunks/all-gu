GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXII 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. It is 
Page 5 
3 November 11th, Happy Veterans Day everybody, and it 
4 is 8:42 a.m. 
5 So we had originally planned we were going 
6 to go to 2:30 today. As I've mentioned to you in 
7 the past because we are drawing kind of near the 
8 end, it is difficult sometimes for me to get enough 
9 people to fill your day. Today might be one of 
10 those days where we get done early. But originally 
11 I had scheduled an officer to come in at 8:30 this 
12 morning, he was going to talk to you about he 
13 actually measured Darren Wilson's car and so forth 
14 and photographed it. 
15 He called me on the way to work this 
16 morning he said he's a crime scene detective and he 
17 is right now at a crime scene. And so he asked if I 
18 could push his testimony off three or four hours. I 
19 said, well, just text me when you're done and we'll 
20 see where we are. 
21 I have photographs that he took of the 
22 vehicle and then I also have a sheet of paper that 
23 actually was, I think, emailed to me quite some time 
24 ago with the measurements on it that he had taken. 
25 Urn, and so what I would propose to do is 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Gore Perry Reporting and Video 
314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury Volume XXII November 11, 2014 
Page 6 
1 that I believe it might be helpful for you to have 
2 those things prior to going down and looking at the 
3 car, just for your own sake. 
4 And so if anybody has an objection to 
5 that, you know, I would like to hear. My thought 
6 was I could give you those photographs and the 
7 measurements and then you all can go look at the 
8 car. And then when you come back, if you have 
9 questions for that officer, you know, we can get him 
10 in later this morning and you can ask questions 
11 about what he did. 
12 You know the only thing he was going to 
13 testify to, yeah, I took these photographs and, 
14 yeah, I took these measurements. So, you know, 
15 unless you had additional questions for him, that's 
16 kind of, you know what I mean, it is not like really 
17 earth shattering. 
18 So that's my proposal that if you are 
19 ready, I will get that stuff for you because I 
20 didn't bring it in here yet to make a copy of 
21 measurements for everybody. 
22 Pass the photographs around so you can 
23 kind of look at them before you go out there and 
24 then you go out and examine the vehicle and you take 
25 the time that you need to do that.

1 Our investigator has made, he has a couple 
2 of steps that he made so he'll give you those for 
3 you to use if you want to do some of your own 
4 investigation. And then at 10:30, I have scheduled 
5 the field training officer for Darren Wilson when he 
6 was an officer at Jennings. You asked about that a 
7 little bit ago, I contacted him, he is coming in at 
8 10:30. 
9 I will probably do a very brief 
10 questioning of him and what his duties and 
11 responsibilities are, and then you can ask him 
12 questions that you think you need to ask. 
13 And then I have, we have the physician's 
14 assistant coming in. She can't be here till 1:00. 
15 Again, we maybe have a gap there and so she will be 
16 here at 1:00 and she will be the last witness of the 
17 day. 
18 Urn, in the meantime, while you're gone 
19 examining the vehicle, Sheila and I talked about it 
20 and we thought we don't have actually the physical 
21 evidence over here at our office yet. That is a 
22 plan before this is all done you are going to be 
23 able to look at things that you want to look at. 
24 There's, we're not going to have discs 
25 brought over, there is no point in looking at a disc

1 because there are lot of discs in evidence. 
2 We do have the clothing of Michael Brown, 
3 which is, as you would imagine is bloody, it is 
4 dried, but it is still bloody. Those are packaged 
5 and in a box. We'll bring that box over for you, 
6 but if you all want to open the box and look at it, 
7 we're going to have to get you gloves and masks and 
8 stuff like that to do that. 
9 But everything else that is in evidence 
10 like the gun, shell casings, the bullets, things 
11 that, you know, the sandals, the bracelets, you 
12 know, things that were seized, we're going to have 
13 those all in a room for you to examine as much as 
14 you want. 
15 And then in the meantime, though, I 
16 thought Sheila and I had said it might be time, that 
17 you could spend working while you are gone examining 
18 the vehicle, I could put out a lot of these 
19 photographs that we've seen over time, crime scene 
20 photographs, and that way, you know, as you are 
21 sitting here, if we're waiting for the next witness, 
22 you all can kind of pass those around and look at 
23 them at your leisure or talk about them just so 
24 you're not sitting here twiddling your thumbs. 
25 And then have you all thought any more, 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 because like I said, we are nearing the end. Are 
2 there any additional witnesses that you think you 
3 need to hear from or would like me to try to get in, 
4 other than as I mentioned, we're still, there is 
5 still about four or five lay people who, you know, 
6 have given some kind of statement in the past about 
7 having seen something, we are trying to get them in. 
8 So we may or may not get all or none of 
9 them in before this is over, but is there anyone 
10 else that y'all would like to hear from or if you 
11 would like to recall a witness, we'll need to know 
12 so I can get that scheduled before, you know, we 
13 conclude everything. 
14 So y'all can talk about that while you are 
15 looking at photographs and stuff too. If there is 
16 any additional people you like or again, if you want 
17 to hear all of the witnesses' testimony is on an 
18 audio disc. We have transcripts of that, so if you 
19 want to review somebody's testimony while you're 
20 here, we can certainly play that for you or just 
21 give you a transcript or whatever you need to review 
22 things, okay. 
23 So with that being said, I guess we'll 
24 take a recess or brief break now while everybody 
25 gets their coats on and I'll get

1 we'll get you over there to look at the vehicle. 
2 And just so you all understand for the 
3 record, this is not Darren Wilson's vehicle, this is 
4 another Tahoe that's the same make, year and model 
5 as Darren Wilson's because the door, as I explained, 
6 is still not on Darren Wilson's vehicle, but the 
7 measurements that I have, actually, don't get your 
8 coats on yet. I told you I was going to get you the 
9 pictures and the measurements. 
10 So we'll take a recess now and I'll go get 
11 those and when you are ready to go over and look at 
12 
13 
the vehicle, we'll get and to take. 
Okay. 
14 (Recess) 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. This is 
16 Kathi Alizadeh, it is November 11th. Sheila Whirley 
17 is here, all 12 grand jurors are here and the court 
18 reporter is taking down what's being said. 
19 So this morning y'all went over, went to 
20 look at the police vehicle. That is the same make, 
21 year and model as Darren Wilson's vehicle or the 
22 vehicle he was driving on August 9th. 
23 You all had plenty of time to do that. Is 
24 there anybody that felt they didn't get to see what 
25 they wanted to see?

1 Also, prior to you all going out there, we 
2 had planned for our witness to testify who actually 
3 photographed and measured, took certain measurements 
4 on Darren Wilson's vehicle. He was going to testify 
5 this morning prior to you seeing that, but the crime 
6 scene detective was actually called to a crime scene 
7 this morning. So it is my understanding that you 
8 don't have any questions for him? So I will let him 
9 know he doesn't need to come in. 
10 Right now we're waiting for our next 
11 witness. So in the meantime I passed out some 
12 photos that have already been, not introduced, but 
13 you all have seen them, but I passed them out so if 
14 you all wanted to look at them again. 
15 I've also given out a another transcript 
16 that contains Darren Wilson's testimony and then 
17 there was also a request to hear again Grand Jury 
18 Exhibit 59, which is a disc that contains a video 
19 audio file that a witness, was 
20 actually talking on Glide, an app that allows you to 
21 talk in realtime. He inadvertently had recorded 
22 
23 
some of the gunshots. If you recall, he said there 
were two shots before he began the recording. So 
24 there was a request to play that again.

1 have other than having graduated from the police 
2 academy in order to be a field training officer? 
3 A There's no legal requirements, most 
4 departments have policies. There is no testing for 
5 it. The academy, the police academy, you go to the

1 Also policies and procedures of your agency and to 
2 mentor them to become successful police officers. 
3 Q All right. How long did you do that for 
4 the City of Normandy? 
5 A I didn't do it continuously because I went 
6 to different positions for about two years though. 
7 Q And then after leaving Normandy, you went 
8 back to Pine Lawn for about a year. Did you, were 
9 you a field training officer in Pine Lawn? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And then after that, you went to Jennings 
12 and you said you were a field training officer in 
13 Jennings? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And so when a new police officer is 
16 assigned to you, for you to be his FTO, how long is 
17 it that you are training that officer? 
18 A There is different levels of the training. 
19 They are under your direct supervision, ride along 
20 with you, usually for six weeks and then depending 
21 on their performance, you decide whether they are 
22 going to be released to a vehicle on their own, but 
23 you still shadow them. 
24 You are still training the officer, 
25 you are still responsible for them. They're on

1 probation for up to a year. You are basically 
2 responsible for that officer for that whole time. 
3 Q And so typically an officer might ride 
4 along with you for up to in excess of six weeks? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, these officers that are assigned to 
7 you, are they commissioned police officers? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So they've already completed their 
10 training at a police academy, they've already been 
11 hired by the City of Jennings? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
How many officers have you mentored or 
14 been a field training officer for? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I'm guess maybe about ten. 
And during that time, have they all been 
17 brand new police officers fresh out of the police 
18 academy? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
So sometimes are your trainees already 
21 experienced police officers, but they may be new to 
22 your municipality?

25 with you for a minimum of six weeks and then

2 might then have their own cars? 
3 A Yes, ma'am.

Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
But in a separate car? 
Yes, ma'am. 
So is it your job then to kind of observe, 
13 let them handle the call, but to be there to help 
14 them or observe how they are doing? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And were you the field training officer 
17 for Darren Wilson when he was a Jennings Police 
18 Officer? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And do you remember when he came to 
21 Jennings, was this his first job out of the police 
22 academy? 
23 A 
24 Q 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. 
So he was a brand new police officer? 
Yes, ma'am.

1 Q And so did he ride along with you for at 
2 least six weeks before he then got in a vehicle on 
3 his own? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q Okay. And just in general, how did you 
6 think he did as a trainee during that six weeks? 
7 A He did very well. Out of the officers I 
8 have trained, he was one of those that was probably 
9 a better officer. 
10 Q And then after the six weeks were 
11 completed, did he then begin to ride on his own? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And did you continue to train him or be 
14 his mentor for that first year that he was a police 
15 officer in the City of Jennings? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Q Okay. Now, when a trainee begins to ride 
18 on their own, are they allowed to make their own 
19 arrests? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so they can function in every way as a 
22 police officer in the City of Jennings, except for 
23 the fact that they have somebody that's watching 
24 over them, correct?

1 Q Did you ever have any concerns about 
2 Officer Wilson having a bad temper? 
3 A No, ma'am, no. 
4 Q Did you ever have any concerns about 
5 Officer Wilson using excessive force during an 
6 arrest? 
7 A No, ma'am. 
8 Q How did you feel he worked with the 
9 community in the City of Jennings? 
10 A Urn, I thought he did very well. One point 
11 that really stands out that I remember distinctly 
12 while he was riding with me in the first six weeks, 
13 we were having a conversation and he brought up the 
14 topic he said, I feel comfortable with the police 
15 work side of it, but I have not had much experience 
16 in the African-American community, such as the one 
17 I'm working in now. I haven't been in that 
18 community. Can you help me with that? 
19 I really thought that that was, 
20 admired him for doing that because it is hard for 
21 somebody to admit that. He took a vested interest 
22 in learning about the community he was working in. 
23 Q So at the time that he was in the City of 
24 Jennings, would you say that the population of 
25 Jennings was, the majority of the population were

A 
Q 
It is, as it is today I would say. 
Did you ever witness him being what you 
4 consider inappropriate as far as anything that you 
5 thought was racist that he might do or say? 
6 A No, ma'am. 
7 Q Now, I explained to you that there was an 
8 interest of the grand jurors coming in and asking 
9 you some questions, so I'm done asking questions. 
10 Sheila, do you have any questions? 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Yeah, I do have just a few. 
12 So tell me how long did you work at 
13 Jennings before you became a field training officer? 
14 A Within my first year they had me start 
15 training at the end of my first year. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Your first year. Did 
17 you have to be on probation for a year. 
18 A I was still on probation when I started 
19 training officers. 
20 MS. WHIRLEY: You were on probation, but 
21 serving as a field training officer? 
22 
23 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you mention that 
24 you had been a field training officer at Normandy, 
25 which was before you went to Jennings?

MS. WHIRLEY: How long did you work at 
3 Normandy before becoming a field training officer. 
4 A Uh, probably about three years. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you were a field 
6 training officer at Normandy, I think you said, for 
7 two years.

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. WHIRLEY: '97. Okay. 
I worked last night. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. What did you teach or 
23 verify that Officer Wilson was proficient at? I 
24 mean, you were his field training officer for six 
25 weeks, how did you verify that he knew what he was

1 doing well enough to let him be on his own? 
2 A In the City of Jennings as a field 
3 training officer it was computer based program, it 
4 has specific goals, also specific topics that were 
5 covered. You know, like constitutional law, your 
6 state law, your policies, your procedures and also 
7 went over the reports, like fraud report, so you had 
8 all of that. It was already lined out for you. 
9 And there was three things that you 
10 had to do, you had to explain that to the officer 
11 that you were training. 
12 The second one was that they had to 
13 be able to articulate it back to you and then the 
14 third was they I had to actually see them perform 
15 that duty. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: A lot of that is done in the 
17 police academy, is that not correct? You have 
18 constitutional law, criminal law, report writing, 
19 same thing you just mentioned? 
20

Q

Correct. 
Actually happened in the police academy? 
Correct. 
So you're just kind of verifying that he

Correct.

1 Q Now, do you write an assessment or some 
2 type of evaluation after the training of the 
3 officer? 
4 A Again, that's all in that computer based 
5 program that the City of Jennings has every day. 
6 You did a daily observation report and you would go 
7 through the list and put the date in what you did 
8 that day. I don't remember weekly or monthly, but 
9 at the end you signed off on that officer. You 
10 signed off after six weeks stating that they are 
11 ready to go on to be shadowed, as we call it. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: You did sign off on Officer 
13 Wilson? 
14 A Yes. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: He met every benchmark that 
16 he was supposed to meet? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Did you train more than one 
19 trainee at a time when you were training Officer 
20 Wilson or did you just train Officer Wilson.

22 officer.

1 that you were field training officer for Officer 
2 Wilson. 
3 A He started with us in 2009, mid 2009. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And were there ever 
5 any complaints from the residents about him? 
6 A I never had any issues with him or none 
7 were brought to me. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: So it is possible there 
9 were, but you don't know? 
10 
11 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you already 
12 answered no complaints about excessive use of force, 
13 correct? 
14 A No, ma'am, none. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: What did you teach, is there 
16 anything taught about use of force while you're 
17 training officers? 
18 A Yes, ma'am. Two things that are big 
19 issues with law enforcement. You go over right away 
20 with them pretty much one is use of force. The 
21 second is your emergency vehicle operations, those 
22 are just two things that officers civil liability 
23 affects people's lives. You get your policy out of 
24 your agency at the time, you go over it with them, 
25 make sure they have that. Make sure that they refer
