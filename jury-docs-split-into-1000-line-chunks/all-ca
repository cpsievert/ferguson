11 this your best recollection of this incident? 
12 WITNESS 10: Yes. 
13 DETECTIVE Okay. And nothing has 
14 been embellished, you know, I mean, you're being 
15 upfront, honest. There's nothing that you're making 
16 more out of or nothing that a you are leaving out on 
17 either end of the spectrum; is that --

20 anything else that you would like to add? Anything 
21 else that you feel is important that we should know? 
22 Any questions that we did not ask you? 
23 And that's not a trick question, that's 
24 just something that I want to give everybody an 
25 opportunity to, you know, speak their peace.

1 WITNESS 10: Urn, I just, urn, I just, uh, I 
2 feel sad about this whole situation that, urn, it had 
3 to end like this. And, urn, it's just, just hearing 
4 everybody's point of view, I feel that, urn, most 
5 people think that, urn, Mike basically f'd the 
6 police. They think the police are bad for them up 
7 until the time they're in need of the police. 
8 And, uh, I just wanted to come forward and 
9 tell it how I seen it because I feel like it's very 
10 rare that somebody's going to come forward and tell 
11 actually what happened.

WITNESS 10: No. 
DETECTIVE Okay. You have 
16 anything? If there is nothing else, the time is

19 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody need to hear 
20 anything over regarding the recorded statement of 
21 Witness Number 10? You have the transcripts that 
22 you can keep in your packet and, of course, at any

1 video that was recorded by a cell phone. This video 
2 was obtained off of the internet. It is contained 
3 on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 26 that I've marked and 
4 might be better for me to do it, I know where to cue 
5 it up to. 
6 As I said, this is not very long and 
7 actually, this clip appears twice on this disc. One 
8 clip includes the video, which I will describe it, 
9 is after the shooting. 
10 The other clip of this contains just the 
11 audio and it has just a plain view screen and all 
12 you are hearing is the audio. It is the same clip, 
13 it is just without the video. I don't know if after 
14 you see the video on if it would assist you to then 
15 just do the audio to just kind of close your eyes 
16 and try to listen because as I said, it is difficult 
17 
18 
to hear because voices, that 
identified as own, is actually a background 
has 
19 speaker in this clip. Can I black that screen while 
20 I'm trying to find it or no? 
21 since this is not very long. It 
22 probably is okay for us to just record. Nobody says 
23 any identifying information on the recording. And 
24 also it would probably be difficult for you to even 
25 to attempt to transcribe it. We don't have a

1 transcript of this and I think one of the reasons, 
2 as you will see, it is very difficult to hear it, 
3 and I don't want to be in a position that I'm saying 
4 this is what we think is being said because it is 
5 your job to decide what you think is being said. 
6 And the entire clip is ten minutes long, 
7 however, I'm going to put the cursor forward to 
8 about a little past six minutes because that is the 
9 time when the conversation occurs that 
10 is talking. 
11 Again, this video in its entirety is ten 
12 minutes long. If you want to watch the entire 
13 video, you certainly can. 
14 I'm going to start the clip at exactly six 
15 minutes. 
16 (Clip is being played at this time.) 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, there again, the 
18 entire clip is ten minutes. If you want to watch 
19 the whole clip or if you want to watch a certain 
20 part of it again or if you want to just do the audio 
21 portion and listen, it is up to you. 
22 Let's just hear the audio. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: So you'd like to just hear 
24 the audio portion? You want me to start at six 
25 minutes or you want me to play the whole thing?

1 I think it would be okay 
2 if you start it at the exact same timeframe. 
3 (playing of the audio recording.) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Start it at 5:59. You 
5 know, I'm not sure that that starts at the same 
6 place that I'm hearing this. Can I review this over 
7 the lunch hour and maybe we can, I don't want to 
8 represent to you that it starts at the same place 
9 because in my mind, I'm thinking it is not at the 
10 same place. 
11 So what's in the beginning 
12 of it, the rest of the six minutes? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: If you want to watch it, I 
14 mean, I don't want to necessarily characterize it 
15 except to say it is all after the shooting and that 
16 it appears to be someone who is recording with a 
17 cell phone or handheld device and then you hear 
18 people in the crowd talking, you hear people near 
19 the camera talking, I don't know if it is the person 
20 who is holding the camera that is doing all the 
21 talking. 
22 Okay. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: You can certainly watch the 
24 whole thing if you want. But before we listen to 
25 that audio portion, let me listen to it during the

1 lunch hour and make sure. I don't want to start it 
2 at a different place and get you confused about 
3 that. 
4 So at this time then, I will just remove 
5 the disc and try to do this at the lunch hour when I 
6 have time to look at it. 
7 Okay. The next thing we are going to play 
8 for you is a disc that is marked Grand Jury Number 
9 27, and it contains several clips which are media 
10 interviews that were done by , who 
11 you will recall testified yesterday, not yesterday, 
12 Tuesday. 
13 And we can go ahead, there is 33 minutes 
14 of video clips. I might speak during and in between 
15 them. Leave the recorder on. 
(Clips are being played) . 16 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: All right. That was a clip 
18 that was aired on August 13th, 2014 on KMOV. 
19 The next clip was aired August 13th, 2014 
20 on CNN Tonight. 
21 (clip is being played.) 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: So the next clip is a 
23 continuation of that. Actually, it appears there is 
24 a total three clips of that interview on CNN.

9 I'll going to play a clip that aired on 
10 August 14th on MSNBC and on a program called last

1 you just watched, but it is all segments of the 
2 interview that you've already seen. So I don't 
3 think it is appropriate for you to, you know, the 
4 reporter's commentary is really not evidence and it 
5 shouldn't play into your decision, I'm not going to 
6 play the final clip that's on Grand Jury Exhibit 
7 Number 27, all right. 
8 Did anybody want to see any of these clips 
9 over again? 
10 This next interview is fairly short, so I 
11 thought maybe we would go ahead and listen to that 
12 and then if you want to take a break. Have you all 
13 ordered lunch? I'm going to pass around a

7 I know your attorney has already spoken to 
8 you, we are going to talk to you today about what 
9 happened on August 9th of this year. So with that 
10 being said, I think would like to say an 
11 opening paragraph or two and then we will start with 
12 what you saw on that day. 
13 I'm actually going to do it. 
14 So and I are both federal prosecutors. I'm 
15 based in Washington D.C., he's based here in St. 
16 Louis. Obviously, we're with the FBI. We wanted to 
17 talk to you because we know that you are already met 
18 with the St. Louis County police detective, but we 
19 are doing our own individual investigations, that is 
20 why we want to meet with you and hear what you have 
21 to say, okay? 
22 Okay. 
23 So basically, as you know, 
24 everything is being recorded. So if you nod your 
25 head or shake your head and I will say is that a yes

2 Okay. 
3 That's just to get your answers 
4 out loud so when we listen to it afterwards, we 
5 don't have to guess what your reaction was, right? 
6 And if you don't understand a question 
7 that any of us ask you, please stop us and make us 
8 clarify because, you know, we intend to talk fast 
9 sometimes. 
10 Uh-huh. 
11 And sometimes we ask bad 
12 questions. We try not to, but if you answer we are 
13 going to assume that you understood. If at any 
14 point you get confused or -- don't just guess, you 
15 were the one that was there. 
16 We are certainly not trying to suggest an 
17 answer. If you think we are looking for an answer, 
18 all we are looking for is the truth. 
19 So, urn, want to make sure that you feel 
20 comfortable in answering the questions and certainly 
21 feel free to correct us if we mischaracterize it, 
22 okay: 
23 Okay. 
24 And we tell this to all the 
25 witnesses, this is a federal investigation and if

2 material or important it is a crime, I like to make 
3 sure that everybody knows that. 
4 Okay. 
5 Urn, and also really important, 
6 we're not going to tell anybody what you told us, so 
7 we're not going to go to another witness and say, 
8 you know, said this or said that, just like 
9 we're not going to say to you, I know a witness told 
10 us something different or told us something the 
11 same. 
12 So it is really important for us to find 
13 out when you actually firsthand saw and heard. And 
14 we knew a lot went on, especially that day on 
15 August 9th. 
16 Okay, okay. 
17 And since that's normal and 
18 that's human nature. 
19 Uh-huh. 
20 Uh, but we just want to make 
21 sure that you are actually telling us what you know 
22 versus what you assume.

9 Instead of telling us it is 
10 rain, just tell us what you saw. 
11 Okay. 
12 If you don't know something or 
13 you can't remember something, that's a perfectly 
14 acceptable answer. A lot of times we like to ask 
15 details to see if we can trigger something. 
16 Uh-huh. 
17 So we can get more details 
18 because we weren't there. 
19 Uh-huh. 
20 So we may quiz you on some 
21 stuff. We're not trying to get an answer other than 
22 the truth. If you don't know, it's perfectly fine 
23 to say I don't know.

Okay. I think that's all 
2 the background we need from you. 
3 So could you just tell us in your own 
4 words and from the beginning what happened that 
5 Saturday, August the 9th. 
6 Okay. As I was coming 
7 around the curve, I hear like tires squeaking, like 
8 "urrrr". And as I get up on the truck, I see them 
9 wrestling through the window. I tried to pull my 
10 phone out because it just didn't look normal for 
11 someone to be wrestling through a cop's window. 
12 So I saw them like pulling back and forth, 
13 like he was trying to pull out, the cop is pulling 
14 in. And when I tried to pull my phone out, the shot 
15 came out, so I like went to the left to try to get 
16 out of the way. 
17 As I'm going to the left, I see the kid, 
18 there ain't no way and that's when he takes off 
19 running. 
20 The cop follows him, shooting behind him, 
21 the kid's body jerks as if he was hit, he turns 
22 around and puts his hands up and the cop continued 
23 to fire until he goes down. 
24 Okay. Where were you coming 
25 around the corner, does this look familiar?

7 They were right here. 
8 Okay. 
9 I was back here whenever I 
10 heard tire squeaking, so I was 
11 Which direction was the car 
12 driving?

14 that way. 
15 
16 
17 
Okay. So it was a truck. 
Yes. 
All right. And you said you 
18 heard the squeals of the tire and then what 
19 happened? 
20 That's whenever I came 
21 around the corner and I saw them wrestling through 
22 the window. 
23 Okay. So you came around

18 As I get up to here, I see 
19 them wrestling through the window and I try to take 
20 my phone out. 
21 Where is your phone. 
22 My phone was probably on my 
23 lap or something. I remember, because as a matter 
24 of fact, I had my phone in my hand. I was trying to

5 made a lift right here. 
6 Uh-huh. 
7 And I pulled right into 
8 there. 
9 Uh-huh. 
10 And the kid yanked away as 
11 I was turning this way and he started running back 
12 there. 
13 Can you point on here where

10 Where was he? 
11 It was a car right behind 
12 him stopped, right behind the officer. I didn't see 
13 this car until I got right here and that's whenever 
14 I saw Dorian duck down on the side of that car. 
15 Okay. Do you know what kind

2 Uh-huh. What do you mean by

4 It appears to me as Michael 
5 is pulling off and the officer is pulling in, kind 
6 of like a tug of war. 
7 Uh-huh. Did you see hands 
8 touching? 
9 I saw Michael's like 
10 pushing up against the thing and whenever he yanked 
11 off, I saw his hands go like that. 
12 Did you see the officers 
13 hands on Michael Brown at all. 
14 I couldn't see his hands, I 
15 just saw he kept trying to pull away, I saw Michael
