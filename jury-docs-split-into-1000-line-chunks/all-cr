1 We saw a lot of 
2 news clips also, including the video you shot on 
3 your phone following the incident. 
4 
5 
A Okay. 
So my question for you, in 
6 the video the two officers, and obviously you 
7 witnessed the event, you saw Officer Darren Wilson, 
8 how certain are you in the video that you shot of 
9 those two officers that the one on the right is 
10 Officer Darren Wilson? 
11 A Okay. I'm want to say 99.9 percent 
12 certain. They look nothing alike. You can tell one 
13 was short and kind of chubby, the other one is tall 
14 and more built. He was the only one running and the 
15 only one that had left the scene before everybody 
16 gathered there. 
17 Between the two people, I'm 
18 100 percent sure between those two people, it was 
19 not the guy on left, it was the guy on the right 
20 99.9 percent accuracy. 
21 Of the two 
22 people, are you sure it was Darren Wilson or is that 
23 someone who looked more like Darren Wilson? I mean, 
24 are you sure when you are taping that was Darren 
25 Wilson?

1 A I'm sure that was Darren Wilson.

4 the FBI and I'm going to reference page 11 and 12.

A 
8 interview? 
Okay. 
That's not the one. 
MS. ALIZADEH: You talking about the FBI 
9 Yeah. 
10 
11 
MS. ALIZADEH: I have one. 
And again, I'm confused, 
12 that's why I'm asking you these questions. 
13 
14 
A Okay. 
This is some kind of car 
15 accident or something. I just automatically looked 
16 right out my window and right now I'm looking out 
17 the window to see a police car right in the middle 
18 of the street. I see a young man standing, and 
19 that's what you said earlier today. 
20 So then you go, I couldn't really tell 
21 what was going on. There was a lot of movement, but 
22 then you say I'm looking at pull into the 
23 driveway after the shot was fired. 
24 Now, the shot fired out the window, so 
25 that's my question. Because you go on to say, you

1 gather your purse and some items and at this time 
2 Michael is running down the street and Darren is 
3 chasing him. So I'm looking at the officer. 
4 
5 A 
I'm really confused by this. 
Uh-huh. 
6 I just want to know from 
7 page ten where you are talking about seeing him 
8 doing a lot of movement. 
9 A Okay. 
10 Is that where you heard 
11 the first shot because on the next page I'm looking 
12 at pulling into the driveway, a shot was 
13 fired. 
14 A Okay. They did all go on at the same 
15 time. 
16 Okay. 
17 A It was like a movement, it was like the 
18 window, you are looking out the window and then 
19 movement, shot, all of that happening. Out of the 
20 
21 
22 
corner of my eye I could see just turning. 
It was all simultaneous? 
A Exactly. She was already by this point to 
23 turn, she was probably, I don't know, she was 
24 already right there and she just turned into the lot

1 And that's why, 
2 , if that shot could have been his hand and 
3 then jerked from the shot being fired in the car, 
4 these things were all happening at the same time and 
5 that's why you thought that? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Thank you. 
8 A You're welcome. 
9 When you 
10 recorded the video, is that the video of who you 
11 think is Darren Wilson, is that the same person you 
12 saw getting out of the police vehicle? 
13 
14 
A Yes. 
Okay. During your 
15 recording of the video, could you tell us what you 
16 saw after, I guess, what the police officer was 
17 doing after Michael Brown fell to the ground? 
18 A Okay. You want me to tell you what the 
19 police officer's doing? Okay. So, while I'm 
20 watching him, I'm not really looking at my phone, 
21 I'm just looking at the things that happen. I have 
22 my phone facing on him so I can get whatever it 
23 could get. I'm looking at him just talk to the 
24 other officer. They are kind of like just 
25 whispering. He didn't look as if he used the same

1 type of protocol as other police officers, if that 
2 makes sense. 
3 Like usually okay, I going back to 
4 what I saw. I'm looking at him standing here 
5 talking to the other officer, he's just standing 
6 there looking over the body, just looking like, like 
7 just a weird look. Just looking at it. He then 
8 just starts pacing back and forth next to the body, 
9 not like back and forth, like immediately back and 
10 forth, it was just kind of a slow movement while he 
11 was looking at the body. He keeps walking and 
12 looked backs at the body and then finally just walks 
13 away and just leaves. After he walks out of my 
14 video, I don't see him any more. 
15 Did you 
16 ever see him make like a radio call? 
17 A Yeah, the officer on the left was the one 
18 doing this on his little walkie-talkie or something, 
19 which was connected. He was just talking, Darren 
20 Wilson was talking to him, probably explaining what 
21 was going on. He was just, he was like, I was 
22 outside at that point, but I still didn't hear him 
23 say anything, I didn't hear the exact words. 
24 One more question, 
25 Did he appear to look injured in any way,

8 MS. ALIZADEH: But you did see that his

10 A When I first was talking to the police 
11 officer, I was trying to make the distinction to 
12 him, it looked red out of anger.

14 and it looked red?

Exactly. 
MS. ALIZADEH: It was enough you remember 
I tried to make the distinction, it did 
5 look red out of anger to me. He looked pissed off 
6 while he was running. He was running full speed, it 
7 could have been the wind making his skin red, it 
8 could have been anything, but I did say that it was 
9 red. 
10 And, yeah, we 
11 are kind of picky. But later in the interview they 
12 asked you about that, and they said it was emotion. 
13 Could it have been worry, could it have been fright. 
14 You said, yes, it could have been one of those. 
15 A Yes, it could have been. 
16 It could have been. You, 
17 at this point, were you trying to tell the people 
18 that were interviewing you that you felt that it was 
19 an emotional red, but you don't recall what kind of 
20 emotion it was? 
21 A The emotion that I picked up was anger. 
22 So she got to telling me it doesn't have to be 
23 anger, it could be. I said, you're right, it very 
24 well could be anything, but the emotion I picked up 
25 was anger.

8 as I was looking. And when I was looking back on my

10 originally noticed. This is another reason that I 
11 presumed it to have been anger.

A 
Okay.

25 him. I don't know what happened with the white car,
