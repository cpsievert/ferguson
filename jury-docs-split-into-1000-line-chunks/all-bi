5 they say something to you first? 
6 A No, you want me to just go with the whole 
7 thing? 
8 Q Sure, go ahead, let's start there. 
9 A I see them walking down the middle of the 
10 street. And first thing that struck me was they're 
11 walking in the middle of the street. I had already 
12 seen a couple cars trying to pass, but they couldn't 
13 have traffic normal because they were in the middle, 
14 so one had to stop to let the car go around and then 
15 another car would come. And the next thing I 
16 noticed was the size of the individuals because 
17 either the first one was really small or the second 
18 one was really big. 
19 And just for the conversation, I 
20 didn't know this then, but the first one's name was 
21 Dorian Johnson, the second one was Michael Brown. 
22 That was discovered, I think, the following day is 
23 when I learned the names. I had never seen them 
24 before.

2 marijuana leaves as a pattern on them. They were 
3 the taller socks that go halfway up your shin. 
4 As I approached them, I stopped a 
5 couple feet in front of Johnson as they are walking 
6 towards me, I am going towards them. And I allowed 
7 him to keep walking towards my window, which was 
8 down. As Johnson came around my driver's side 
9 mirror I said, "why don't you guys walk on the 
10 sidewalk." He kept walking, as he is walking he 
11 said, "we are almost to our destination." 
12 Q Do you think he used those words 
13 destination, we are almost to our destination? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. He said we are almost to our 
15 destination and he pointed this direction over my 
16 vehicle. So like in a northeasternly (sic) 
17 direction. And as he did that, he kept walking and 
18 Brown was starting to come around the mirror and as 
19 he came around the mirror I said, "well, what's 
20 wrong with the sidewalk." Brown then replied, urn, 
21 it has vulgar language.

1 expected response from a simple request. 
2 When I start looking at Brown, first 
3 thing I notice is in his right hand, his hand is 
4 full of Cigarillos. And that's when it clicked for 
5 me because I now saw the Cigarillos, I looked in my 
6 mirror, I did a doublecheck that Johnson was wearing 
7 a black shirt, these are the two from the stealing. 
8 And they kept walking, as I said, 
9 they never once stopped, never got on the sidewalk, 
10 they stayed in the middle of the road. 
11 So I got on my radio and Frank 21 is 
12 my call sign that day, I said Frank 21 I'm on 
13 Canfield with two, send me another car. 
14 I then placed my car in reverse and 
15 backed up and I backed up just past them and then 
16 angled my vehicle, the back of my vehicle to kind of 
17 cut them off kind to keep them somewhat contained. 
18 As I did that, I go to open the door 
19 and I say, hey, come here for a minute to Brown. As 
20 I'm opening the door he turns, faces me, looks at me 
21 and says, "what the fuck are you going to do about 
22 it", and shuts my door, slammed it shut. I haven't 
23 even got it open enough to get my leg out, it was 
24 only a few inches. 
25 I then looked at him and told him to

1 get back and he was just staring at me, almost like 
2 to intimidate me or to overpower me. The intense 
3 face he had was just not what I expected from any of 
4 this. 
5 I then opened my door again and used 
6 my door to push him backwards, and while I'm doing 
7 that I tell him to, "get the fuck back", and then I 
8 use my door to push him. 
9 Q You tell him to, "get the fuck back"? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q Okay. 
12 A He then grabs my door again and shuts my 
13 door. At that time is when I saw him coming into my 
14 vehicle. His head was higher than the top of my 
15 car. And I see him ducking and as he is ducking, 
16 his hands are up and he is coming in my vehicle. 
17 I had shielded myself in this type of 
18 manner and kind of looked away, so I don't remember 
19 seeing him come at me, but I was hit right here in 
20 the side of the face with a fist. I don't think it 
21 was a full-on swing, I think it was a full-on swing, 
22 but not a full shot. I think my arm deflected some 
23 of it, but there was still a significant amount of 
24 contact that was made to my face. 
25 Q Now, he was hitting you with what hand?

1 A I believe it was his right, just judging 
2 by how we were situated. 
3 Q Right. 
4 A But like I said, I had turned away, had my 
5 eyes, I was shielding myself.

Q 
A 
Q 
Where did you see the Cigarillos at? 
They were in his right hand. 
Okay. Were there any broken Cigarillos or 
9 anything in your car later? 
10 A No, I don't remember seeing anything on 
11 the ground or anything. 
12 Q Okay. 
13 A After he hit me then, it stopped for a 
14 second. He kind of like, I remember getting hit and 
15 he kind of like grabbed and pulled, and then it 
16 stopped. When I looked up, if this is my car door, 
17 I'm sitting here facing that way, he's here. He 
18 turns like this and now the Cigarillos I see in his 
19 left hand. He's going like this and he says, "hey 
20 man, hold these." 
21 Q So you start out with Cigarillos in his 
22 right hand? 
23 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
At this point they are in his left hand? 
Correct.

1 Q He didn't have like two hands of 
2 Cigarillos?

A 
Q 
A 
No, I only saw them in one hand. 
You only saw them in one, okay, go ahead. 
And he reaches back and he says, "hey man, 
6 hold these." I'm assuming to Johnson, but I 
7 couldn't see Johnson from my line of sight. 
8 Q But you could tell he was giving Johnson 
9 Cigarillos?

12 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, I saw them in his hand go around. 
All right. 
And he said, "hey man, hold these." And 
13 at that point I tried to hold his right arm because 
14 it was like this at my car. This is my car window. 
15 I tried to hold his right arm and use my left hand 
16 to get out to have some type of control and not be 
17 trapped in my car any more. And when I grabbed him, 
18 the only way I can describe it is I felt like a 
19 five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Holding onto a what? 
Hulk Hogan, that's just how big he felt 
22 and how small I felt just from grasping his arm. 
23 And as I'm trying to open the door is 
24 when, and I can't really get it open because he is 
25 standing only maybe 6 inches from my door, but as I

1 was trying to pull the handle, I see his hand coming 
2 back around like this and he hit me with this part 
3 of his right here, just a full swing all the way 
4 back around and hit me right here. (indicating) 
5 After he did that, next thing I 
6 remember is how do I get this guy away from me. 
7 What do I do not to get beaten inside my car. 
8 I remember having my hands up and I 
9 thought to myself, you know, what do I do. 
10 I considered using my mace, however, 
11 I wasn't willing to sacrifice my left hand, which is 
12 blocking my face to go for it. I couldn't reach 
13 around on my right to get it and if I would have 
14 gotten it out, the chances of it being effective 
15 were slim to none. His hands were in front of his 
16 face, it would have blocked the mace from hitting 
17 him in the face and if any of that got on me, I know 
18 what it does to me and I would have been out of the 
19 game. I wear contacts, if that touches any part of 
20 my eyes, then I can't see at all. 
21 Like I said, I don't carry a taser, I 
22 considered my asp, but to get that out since I kind 
23 of sit on it, I usually have to lean forward and 
24 pull myself forward to the steering wheel to get it 
25 out. Again, I wasn't willing to let go of the one

1 defense I had against being hit. The whole time, I 
2 can't tell you if he was swinging at me or grabbing 
3 me or pushing me or what, but there was just stuff 
4 going on and I was looking down figuring out what to 
5 do. 
6 Also, when I was grabbing my asp, I 
7 knew if I did even get it out, I'm not going to be 
8 able to expand it inside the car or am I going to be 
9 able to make a swing that will be effective in any 
10 manner. 
11 Next I considered my flashlight. I 
12 keep that on the passenger side of the car. I 
13 wasn't going to, again, reach over like this to grab 
14 it and then even if I did grab it, would it even be 
15 effective. We are so close and confined. 
16 So the only other option I thought I 
17 had was my gun. I drew my gun, I turned. It is 
18 kind of hard to describe it, I turn and I go like 
19 this. He is standing here. I said, "get back or 
20 I'm going to shoot you." 
21 He immediately grabs my gun and says, 
22 "you are too much of a pussy to shoot me." The way 
23 he grabbed it, do you have a picture? 
24 Q I do have some pictures of your gun. 
25 Well, you can tell us if it is your gun, I believe

1 it is. 
2 A My gun was basically pointed this way. 
3 I'm in my car, he's here, it is pointed this way, 
4 but he grabs it with his right hand, not his left, 
5 he grabs with his right one and he twists it and 
6 then he digs it down into my hip. (indicating) 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: Kathi, can you do the 
8 computer? I'm going to let you see these photos 
9 from Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10, and there's some 
10 numbers on the back of these photos just so we can 
11 keep track of what you are looking at. And I'm 
12 going to announce what they are and then I will let 
13 you tell us a little bit about them, okay? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
All right. 
Let me just get my glasses. These are 
16 Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10, but the photo that I'm 
17 showing you is 60, 66, 63, so they're not in order 
18 and then 69, so if you could look at all of those 
19 photos. And tell me if that represents what you 
20 know to be your weapon and your ammunition? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, it does. 
Let me see if we can get this, let me try 
23 to get this started. We'll talk a little bit about 
24 while we're working on that. So those are photos of 
25 your weapons; is that correct?
