Okay. 
I mean, he turned around, and I'm assuming 
3 that he was just stunned, that's how it appeared to 
4 me. That he looked down at his hands and he saw 
5 blood. He turned around and he just started walking 
6 back towards the officer.

You were there? 
I assumed that that's what he was doing, 
11 but I couldn't hear words being, between the two 
12 people because I don't recall them saying anything, 
13 I don't recall. 
14 Q I'm sorry, I'm trying not to talk at the

23 fall after the last shooting?

25 about right here. (indicating)

13 shoot him that last time? 
14 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
A 
No. 
Why? 
Because he had stopped, I mean, he was 
17 kind of standing there and he just started boom, 
18 boom, boom, boom, and he just fell. 
19 Q Okay. So when you said he had stopped? 
20 A He was just standing there, he wasn't 
21 moving, he wasn't running, he wasn't doing anything. 
22 Q So the last round of shots, Michael Brown 
23 was not even walking towards the officer? 
24 A No. He walked and then it was like as he 
25 was shooting, he just started falling like a domino,

2 Q Okay. So explain to me, I don't want to 
3 be confused. Why you didn't think it was necessary 
4 for him to shoot those last rounds of shots at 
5 Michael Brown? 
6 A I just think it was too much. I mean, 
7 that's just me being a mother, this being a child, 
8 he was not charging at him, he did not have a weapon 
9 that I could see, I mean, I guess because these are

11 was shooting. And that's when he backed away from

18 a little bit more clarification. This is not a safe 
19 area. Is there gang activity in the area that you 
20 know? 
21 A Honestly, I don't, I don't know. I just 
22 don't want my child there. When I say that, it is 
23 
24 
just that my son is years old, he's 
, he's a good kid. Things happen, police 
25 are always down there. I don't know what goes on.

Every time I tell him what to do and he

1 Road, there are no lights on Parker, he had his high 
2 beams on. The police officer pulled him over and he 
3 stopped, he was not disrespectful, he was not 
4 belligerent, he pulled out his insurance, his 
5 license and the police officer told him, young man, 
6 I'm just giving you a warning, turn your high beams 
7 off. And my child was so afraid, the officer wanted 
8 to know if he needed us to come and pick him up. 
9 So he respects the authority, 
10 however, I don't want him to be in a situation where 
11 he has to second guess anything that my husband and 
12 I have told him about, what he's supposed to do when 
13 he's encountered by a person of authority. My child 
14 has a 3.5 GPA. He's never been suspended, he's 
15 never been in trouble, but it is always that one 
16 incident. 
17 When he leaves the house, he's only 
18 to have two people in his car outside of his sister.

20 well, but we try to train him and teach him to do 
21 things that he's supposed to do. But that's not 
22 always the case. And when you have other people in 
23 your car, you don't know what they have on them. So

11 to 100. And honestly, I think it was just something

4 We had a change of plans today. The 
5 witness for this afternoon left me a message needing 
6 to reschedule, so I have now gotten ahold of the 
7 firearms examiner who is going to come over at 
8 1:00 or whenever you are done with your lunch break. 
9 So he will give his testimony after lunch. I'm 
10 going to try to get somebody else. He won't take an 
11 hour and a half, but I will try to get another 
12 police officer or someone else to come in to round 
13 out the rest of the afternoon. 
14 And as of right now, I've got to see 
15 what's going on outside of this room. If you want 
16 to take a quick break since we will start back up 
17 with listening to more statements. 
18 (Recess). 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: It is 10:54, this is Kathi 
20 Alizadeh. Sheila Whirley is not in the room, she's 
21 just outside. All 12 grand jurors are present, as 
22 
23

asked her to come over and she needs to 
24 address you as a group. There won't be any 
25 individual questioning, but she's going to talk to

2 Neither Sheila nor I will be in the room 
3 when she's here to talk to you. 
4 THE COURT: It is Monday, October 6th, and 
5 I'm back in front of you mainly because I'm always 
6 thinking about you and I have a little bit of 
7 information that I want to share with you. And I 
8 hope that what I'm here to say will also guide you. 
9 Urn, I received some information that some 
10 of you, and by the way, I have no names, and you are 
11 not at the principal's office right now, you have 
12 not been called to the principal's office. I want 
13 to assure you about that, but some of you may have 
14 done some independent investigation or some 
15 research, and I'm here to caution you about that. 
16 Your job, as you know, when I told you 
17 when you started here will be to listen to the 
18 evidence that you're going to hear and then at some 
19 point, you're going to be deliberating. 
20 It's very important that you all come to 
21 deliberate, that you are all considering the same 
22 evidence. You will each have thoughts about the 
23 evidence you've heard, you will each have opinions, 
24 but the very important thing to give the decision 
25 you make credibility and value is that you are all

1 considering the same information and evidence. 
2 And so I'm here to caution you do not go 
3 out and do independent research and investigation. 
4 If there is something you want, you tell the 
5 prosecutors. They will go and get that for you. 
6 And if they can't get it for you, they'll tell you 
7 why they can't get it. 
8 Ask for anything you think you need to 
9 reach the decision you're going to be reaching, and 
10 I can't caution you enough about that. 
11 I think of you often and I think of you 
12 because, and I told you this before, I told you at 
13 the beginning and I still tell you this, you are the 
14 face of our community. This decision is important, 
15 you are good people. You collectively are our St. 
16 Louis County. We have St. Louis County, that's our 
17 community here. 
18 You are, you are the face of our 
19 community. Your decision will be the decision of 
20 the community because you good people have listened 
21 to all of this evidence and then reached your 
22 decision. 
23 The decision you reach will be thoughtful, 
24 it will be thorough, and it will be based on as much 
25 evidence as you ask for and as can be brought to

1 you. 
2 And just so you are deliberating and 
3 talking back and forth, just so you all know, you're 
4 thinking about the same evidence. That's why it is 
5 so important that you not do this independent 
6 research, independent investigation. 
7 So I'm going to ask you to please, if 
8 there's something you have, it has to be shared 
9 collectively. I'm going to ask you from this point 
10 forward, do not go forward and do anything 
11 independent. Ask the prosecutors for it. 
12 I guess I've stated what I really wanted 
13 to state, but I have such faith in you. I think 
14 you, no matter what the decision is, your decision 
15 is going to be the result of a well thought out and 
16 conscientious approach to considering it. That's 
17 what is provided for in the law. You're going 
18 through a very hard task at this time. 
19 But when you go through that task, you 
20 should know at the end of the day, and I will know 
21 at the end of the day, you have done everything that 
22 is provided for under the law in our justice system 
23 when grand juries sit, and you have done everything 
24 that has been asked of you as a citizen of St. Louis 
25 County.

1 So my caution to you is if there is 
2 anything you want, you tell these prosecutors, they 
3 will get you that information. And if they can't, 
4 they will tell you why, ask them why. You are 
5 certainly free to do that. 
6 But keep yourself safe too. I respect the 
7 law and I follow the law and I'm following the law 
8 right through to the very end. And, urn, I will 
9 answer questions that people have because people are 
10 free to ask questions in our justice system. 
11 If the press comes to me and ask me 
12 questions, I am going to follow the law in that 
13 regard. I believe I have followed the law up to 
14 this point with regard to any questions from the 
15 media, I will continue to do that, but when you do 
16 independent investigation, I worry that you keep, 
17 that you may expose yourself to dangerous 
18 situations, and you may create a situation where 
19 people start talking about you and reporting they've 
20 seen this, they've seen that, and it may lead to 
21 more problems than we could ever imagine. 
22 So please keep your research and 
23 investigation here in this room, please keep 
24 yourselves safe and please know that you are the 
25 very good people of St. Louis County, we are lucky

1 to have in St. Louis County doing this very hard

with , I believe that that is where she 
lives, which on the map is right here, Building

5 And I will also let you know that we have 
6 a map that has been put together for you that has 
7 the dots on it of every one of the witnesses who are 
8 testifying and you will have a legend that will have 
9 the number of the witness and then the name. 
10 So eventually when all the witnesses are

together, but right now since we haven't heard

all the witnesses, we are going to wait until 
18 we get all of those people on to testify. So you 
19 don't have to worry about trying to remember so much 
20 as far as where everybody was because there will be 
21 a map given to you that kind of lays that out. 
22 Urn, also, there is a recorded statement of
