2 of his throat, his neck? 
3 A I don't believe his neck was swabbed, no. 
4 Q Okay. And if it was, you would know about 
5 that; is that right? 
A 6 I would have a report, yes. 
7 Q Okay. Now, you actually had an interview 
8 with the officer, Darren Wilson, on, was it the 
9 lOth? 
10 A Yes, ma'am. 
11 When you interviewed him? Q 
A 
13 And you allowed him to tell you whatever Q 
14 he wanted to tell you, right? 
15 A That's correct. 
16 Q You weren't stopping him from g1v1ng you 
17 information at any point; is that right? 
18 A I asked clarifying questions, but I did 
19 not stop him, no. 
20 Q You even asked him was there anything that 
21 he wanted to tell you that you hadn't asked? 
22 A I do that at the end of all interviews, 
23 yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And it was recorded? 
25 A It was, yes. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 76 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q And I believe when you asked him that his 
2 response was, I think we're good, does that sound 
3 right? 
That sounds right, yes. 4 
5 
A 
Q So he never told you that he chased down, 
6 chased after Michael Brown because, and continued to 
7 pursue him and eventually killed him because he was 
8 in fear that Michael Brown would attack other 
9 officers who were coming to the scene, did he ever 
10 tell you that? 
11 A He did not say that, no. 
12 
13 
14 time. 
Q Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: That's all I have at this 
15 GRAND JUROR: I know that you and, I guess 
16 it was Detective and Detective 
17 Detective , I think he was responsible for 
18 collecting the duty belt; 1s that right. 
19 A Detective collected the duty belt. 
20 GRAND JUROR: Detective collected 
21 the duty belt? 
22 A Yes. 
23 GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
24 Darren Wilson, did he tell you he wanted to use his 
25 pepper spray at one time, but he didn't. He thought 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 77 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 about using it and then he thought aga1n because he 
2 didn't want it to come back in on him? 
3 A I don't remember the exact phrase that he 
4 used, but he made mention that he thought about 
5 us1ng his OC spray or his 
6 
7 A 
GRAND JUROR: Mace. 
Mace, as you said. But he also made 
8 mention that he realized he was in a confined space, 
9 mean1ng his vehicle and in a confined space, that 
10 obviously can affect other people, not just the 
11 intended target I think 1s what he was implying. 
12 GRAND JUROR: So we later found out from 
13 that mace or pepper spray 1s 
14 assigned to each patrolman and we got our report 
15 from, I guess , and no pepper spray was turned 
16 1n. Did you know about that? 
17 A No, I did not. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me clarify this, okay. 
19 So, Detective, the duty belt, what's a duty belt? 
20 A A duty belt is essentially a belt that 
21 goes, obviously, on top of the pants and shirt that 
22 you always wear above a normal belt that contains 
23 the equipment that a police officer is going to wear 
24 during the course of his duty. 
25 So it has a place for his weapon, his 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 78 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 extra magazines, his baton if he carr1es one, his 
2 handcuffs, his radio holders, his mace, his taser, 
3 anything that would be deemed necessary for an 
4 officer to use in the course of his duties. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: And you are aware, aren't 
6 you, that on the night or the afternoon following 
7 the shooting, Detective , who is the one who 
8 went to the Ferguson Police Department and seized 
9 the gun, did not seize Officer Wilson's duty belt, 
10 correct? 
11 A I'm aware of that, yes. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: And did not inspect the 
13 duty belt or photograph the duty belt, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: And was it sometime later 
16 1n the investigation that you contacted me and 
17 indicated that Darren Wilson's attorney asked us if 
18 we wanted the duty belt? 
19 
20 
A That's correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And what date was that that 
21 Darren Wilson's attorney contacted you, asking if 
22 you wanted the duty belt? 
23 A I'll look it up here to be sure. Friday, 
24 September 12th. 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: So more than a month after 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 79 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the shooting, correct? 
2 
3 
A Correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And did the attorney tell 
4 you where the duty belt had been all this time. 
5 A He did. He indicated that the duty belt 
6 was placed in the trunk of Darren Wilson's personal 
7 vehicle when he left the Ferguson police station and 
8 that is where that duty belt remained until it was 
9 brought to our attention. And then from there he 
10 removed the belt from his vehicle and put it in a 
11 box and that box was then released to us. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So typically, Detective, lS 
13 a duty belt actually the personal property of the 
14 officer, is that something that they go out and get 
15 for themselves and it is their duty belt or did they 
16 trade duty belts with other officers. 
17 A I can't speak personally but for St. Louis 
18 County, St. Louis County provides those duty belts 
19 to each individual officer, but obviously property 
20 of St. Louis County. But in the sense of trading 
21 with other officers, no, there is no trading with 
22 other officers. Once that belt is assigned to a 
23 particular person, it is that particular person's 
24 belt. 
25 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So at the end of their 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 80 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 duty they would, they could take that belt home with 
2 them that had their gun, their handcuffs, magazines? 
3 
4 
A 
Q 
5 with them? 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Whatever 1s on the bet, that's goes home 
It does, yes. 
They don't leave it at the station for the 
8 next shift? 
9 A They do not. 
10 Q Okay. So now when you called me up and 
11 actually talked to me about having been contacted by 
12 Darren Wilson's attorney about the duty belt, we had 
13 a discussion about that; is that right? 
14 A We did. 
15 Q And we talked about whether or not we 
16 should se1ze that duty belt? 
17 A We did. 
18 Q And between you and I we decided it was a 
19 good idea to get it? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And when the duty belt was seized, 
22 however, the officer's gun, of course, is not 1n it 
23 because that was seized by Detective 
24 correct? 
25 A That's correct. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 81 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 Q The other items that are contained in a 
2 duty belt, do you recall if those were in the duty 
3 belt? 
4 A I would have to look at the photos to know 
5 for sure. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I believe, have we 
7 seen photos of the duty belt, have you guys seen 
8 those? 
9 GRAND JUROR: We have a list of what was 
10 on it and what was fingerprinted. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me double check because 
12 I know I didn't call the witness who seized the duty 
13 belt. We have the duty belt as one of the items for 
14 you all to look at, but as far as whether there was 
15 anything in the duty belt, those photographs would 
16 show it. When we break for lunch before you begin 
17 deliberating, let me go back and check and give you 
18 those photos, okay. 
19 But at any rate, if there was things on 
20 the duty belt after the shooting, it is obviously 
21 conceivable that Darren Wilson, since he had 
22 possession of that duty belt from the day of the 
23 shooting until it was seized September 12th, could 
24 have removed things, could have changed things 
25 around and what have you, correct? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 82 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
A That's possible. 
MS. ALIZADEH: We also discussed whether 
3 or not we would try to process the duty belt either 
4 for DNA or fingerprints, correct? 
5 A We did. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: And we discussed the fact 
7 that if you process for DNA, then you really kind of 
8 destroy the prints that might be on the item and 
9 v1ce versa, if you actually process for prints, then 
10 you might obliterate any DNA that might be on the 
11 item. 
12 So did we discuss and talk about having it 
13 processed for prints? 
14 
15 
A We did. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And you're aware that the 
16 duty belt was negative for Michael Brown's prints? 
17 
18 
A It was. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I've got the duty belt, so 
19 whatever is on it, if there was anything on it when 
20 it was seized that would still be on it, would that 
21 be fair to say? 
22 
23 yes. 
24 
A It would still be 1n the same condition, 
MS. ALIZADEH: And that would be police 
25 procedure when something is seized, you package it 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 83 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 and document it 1n the condition that it was when 
2 you seized it and would have been photographed in 
3 that condition as well? 
4 
5 
A Yes, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I do have photographs. 
6 I haven't g1ven them to you, I'll go get them. 
If 
7 GRAND JUROR: Considering this is a crime 
8 that we are sitting here discussing, urn, wouldn't 
9 everything on Police Officer Wilson be considered 
10 evidence? My question is, why wouldn't his duty 
11 belt be detained the day of the shooting when 
12 pictures were taken of him before he went to the 
13 emergency room and of his uniform, why wouldn't 
14 everything be considered evidence that day because 
15 that 1s very important? 
16 A Obviously, I wasn't at the Ferguson police 
17 station when the items that were originally seized 
18 on August 9th were seized. I agree with you in that 
19 it's important. I wasn't made aware of the fact 
20 that it wasn't seized until obviously a later date 
21 and I can't answer that question because I wasn't 
22 there. 
23 GRAND JUROR: So how could you do an 
24 investigation if you haven't collected evidence? 
25 A Well, clearly we collected evidence. We 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 84 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 just did not seize that duty belt on that particular 
2 day mean1ng on August 9th. We did seize, obviously, 
3 his weapon and his clothing and those things, but we 
4 did not se1ze his duty belt. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me just ask, Detective, 
6 how long have you been a detective for St. Louis 
7 County? 
8 
9 
A Almost eight years. 
MS. ALIZADEH: And in your exper1ence, 
10 have you ever had cases where during the course of 
11 the investigation, other things are made known and 
12 then you wish you would have done something that you 
13 now no longer have the opportunity to do? 
14 A Absolutely. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Detective, I mean, 
16 Officer Wilson, was interviewed by at 
17 the hospital, correct? 
18 A Correct. 
19 Q And we know his duty belt wasn't seized 
20 that day? 
21 A That's correct. 
22 Q And it was the next day that you 
23 interviewed him at your headquarters, correct? 
24 
25 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And I imagine was he in street clothes 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 85 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 about mentally doing a mental, I guess, inventory of 
9 the items on his duty belt during the time he says 
10 Michael Brown was assaulting him? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
He did make reference to that, yes. 
And yet you didn't make any decision at 
13 that time to seize the duty belt? 
14 A I think at that point I didn't know that 
15 it had not been seized. 
16 GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
17 Officer Darren Wilson on the lOth, what did he 
18 indicate to you as the reason why Michael Brown 1s 
19 leaving the car, why Officer Wilson exited his 
20 vehicle to begin pursuit what was his justification? 
21 I know what he told you us, I'd be interested in 
22 what he told you? 
23 A I think two separate questions there, am I 
24 correct? The first question is, would you repeat 
25 the first question? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 86 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: What did Darren Wilson 
2 explain was his reason for exiting his police 
3 vehicle and pursuing Michael Brown on foot? 
4 
5 
6 that? 
7 
8 
A 
A 
To arrest him. 
GRAND JUROR: That's what he told you on 
Yes, s1r. 
GRAND JUROR: I know we've heard evidence 
9 that Michael Brown after he turned around and 
10 advanced back towards Officer Wilson, and we have 
11 our diagram of the crime scene with the measurements 
12 on it and I just want to make sure I'm interpreting 
13 all of this right. So as far as physical evidence, 
14 we have the blood on the ground that was about 21 or 
15 22 feet from where Michael Brown ended up. So we 
16 know for a fact that's a m1n1mum distance he might 
17 have advanced and from eyewitness testimony that 
18 placed him at the corner of Coppercreek, that 
19 dimension looks like it is closer to 48 to 50 feet; 
20 1s that correct? So that would be like an outer 
21 A I'm going to look at this diagram also 
22 just so I'm sure we are on the same page here. 
23 So you're saying, obviously, this 
24 would be zero right here, right. 
25 GRAND JUROR: The distance was 48 feet 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 87 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 2 inches according to this diagram. 
2 
3 
A Correct, yes, s1r. So we would say, and 
you made reference to the blood on the ground. So 
4 from this point here, the red stains in the roadway 
5 are identified what was later determined to be 
6 Michael Brown's blood as Items 19 and 20 on the key 
7 for the diagram. So Items 19 and 20, so the zero 1s 
8 here, identified as being 31 feet and 26 feet 
9 7 inches, and this direction here, and then you're 
10 correct in saying if we continue to move west on 
11 Canfield Drive, Michael Brown's left foot and right 
12 foot for that matter are, 48 feet 2 inches, yes, 
13 s1r. 
14 GRAND JUROR: If I did the calculation 
15 that was 21 and a half feet? 
16 
17 
A Yes, sir. 
GRAND JUROR: Physical evidence, 
18 eyewitness reports would have doubled that. 
19 A 21, 22 feet between the blood and where 
20 Michael Brown's body was when we arrived, yes. 
21 GRAND JUROR: Okay. And a second 
22 question. We heard the audiotape that had the last 
23 ten shots on it, can you tell us exactly what that 
24 timeframe was from the first shot to the tenth shot 
25 there? We tried to approximate it, it was s1x or 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 88 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 seven seconds, but do you know exactly? 
2 A I know that that audio was sent to someone 
3 at the FBI in Quantico who does testing relating to 
4 audio and things of that nature. I don't have that 
5 report in front of me and I wouldn't be comfortable 
6 in saying what those, what that analyst identified. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: I do have the report. I 
8 can g1ve it to you. He did not time, there is 
9 nothing about the duration of the shots. The report 
10 just indicates that there were ten, what appeared to 
11 be ten apparent gunshots and a male voice speaking. 
12 It was just an analyst of the audio and it doesn't 
13 really say, it says nothing about duration of the 
14 shots. 
15 So I'd be happy to get that report for 
16 you. 
17 GRAND JUROR: There wasn't a craft line 
18 that showed time of duration? 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: No, that wasn't done. 
20 A Yes, sir. 
21 GRAND JUROR: In your professional 
22 op1n1on, I'm not a blood splatter analyst, but say 
23 Michael Brown 1s standing around the area where we 
24 know his body fell and he's shot in the head, could 
25 where the blood landed potentially have been, I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 89 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 don't know some trajectory or we to expect or 
2 understand that, I don't know what my question 1s. 
3 If he was traveling from the baseline you 
4 marked as zero the corner of Coppercreek and 
5 Canfield that would somehow trail, is there a way to 
6 know? 
7 A I'm not a blood spatter analyst either, 
8 but I think 22 feet would be an extremely 
9 unrealistic expectation that blood is going to 
10 travel that far. 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: Did you have occas1on 
talk to ? 
A I did. 
to 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 GRAND JUROR: We heard of some testimony 
16 about, but we haven't heard directly, can you g1ve 
17 us a quick synopsis of what he said happened? 
A I guess, let me clarify first. When you 18 
19 are talking about you are making 
20 reference 
21 GRAND JUROR: To the person in the video 
22 that we have seen, because what I'm trying to 
23 determine is, you know, what was his demeanor 1n the 
24 store in person versus what we are seeing on a 
25 screen. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 90 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 A The and the individual 1n the 
2 video, obviously, we may have discussed this last 
3 week does not speak English. So when we talk to 
4 him, we talk to him with an interpreter. 
5 
6 A 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
And through the interpreter he indicated 
7 that you're saying demeanor, meaning Michael Brown's 
8 demeanor? 
9 
10 A 
GRAND JUROR: Yes. 
He said Michael Brown walked 1n and was 
11 us1ng curse words. He couldn't recall what those 
12 curse words were. There was some degree of a 
13 language barrier there and he collaborated 
14 essentially what you saw 1n the video. 
15 I showed him the video during the 
16 course of the interview that I conducted with him, I 
17 showed him the video and he corroborated that 1s 
18 obviously what took place from his perspective, but 
19 in terms of actual language, he knew that there were 
20 curse words he said, but the language barrier 
21 prevented him from explaining any further what he 
22 was say1ng. 
23 
24 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
GRAND JUROR: In your interview with 
25 Darren Wilson, his interaction with Michael Brown, 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 91 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 that he thought Michael Brown had a weapon of any 
2 kind? 
3 
4 
A No. 
GRAND JUROR: He didn't indicate or no, he 
5 didn't have a weapon? He didn't mention it at all 
6 or he said yes, I know he didn't. 
7 A I would want to check the transcript for 
8 an exact account, however, at the point that I, 
9 remember, at the point that I interviewed Darren 
10 Wilson, there had already been one cursory interview 
11 completed with him or a safety statement completed 
12 with him. And in that safety statement and in that 
13 cursory interview, obviously, he made no mention of 
14 a weapon. So to some degree it was implied that 
15 there was no weapon involved 1n this on Michael 
16 Brown's part. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Detective , do you 
18 recall, and his statement will speak for itself and 
19 you have a transcript of his statement, but do you 
20 recall in his statement to you him saying that he 
21 saw Michael Brown's hand go into his waistband? 
22 
23 
A He did say that, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: But he never said that he 
24 saw a weapon? 
25 A Correct. Just 1n terms of see1ng a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 92 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 weapon, no, he never indicated that he saw one. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Did he ever tell you that 
3 he thought Michael Brown was going for a weapon? 
4 A In the sense of when Darren Wilson is 
5 making reference to Michael Brown putting his right 
6 hand, he described it as he put his right hand in 
7 his waistband and then started coming towards Darren 
8 Wilson. That would have been an instance where it 
9 could have been implied that, yes, there was a 
10 weapon there. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: He never said that, the 
12 interview will speak for itself, I want y'all to 
13 review it if you need to. 
14 But he never said to you, I thought he was 
15 go1ng for a weapon so I had so shoot him, or do you 
16 recall? 
17 A I'm go1ng to check my report. 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I'm going from my 
19 memory as well, I don't have copy of the transcript 
20 1n front of me. 
21 A So 1n the transcript here he makes 
22 reference to during his first stride, he took his 
23 right hand, put it under his shirt and put it in his 
24 waistband. And then as he continues, he again makes 
25 reference to still charging, and again, I'm reading 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 93 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 the transcript here, still charging, hand still 1n 
2 his waistband, hasn't slowed down. And then he 
3 again makes reference to the same thing, still 
4 running at me, hadn't slowed down, hands still 1n 
5 his waistband. 
6 So he makes reference to it three 
7 times there and then one final time when he says, 
8 when he went down, his hand was still under his 
9 right hand, was still under his body, looks like it 
10 was still in his waistband. 
11 So in that sense does he ever 
12 specifically say the word weapon? No. In that 
13 conversation that I'm having with him, me, as a 
14 police officer knowing that if an individual has his 
15 hand in his waistband, that 1s of concern to me 
16 personally. 
17 And so it was implied, 1n my op1n1on, 
18 that he was making reference, that Darren Wilson was 
19 making reference to believing that there could have 
20 been a weapon 1n Michael Brown's waistband, however, 
21 as you said, he never specifically mentioned the 
22 word weapon. 
23 GRAND JUROR: On that same note, we know 
24 that Michael Brown's hand was, had the severe lnJury 
25 with blood, so you would be able to look at the 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 94 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 shirt and shorts to be able to see if there was 
2 blood in that specific area, correct? I don't know 
3 if you can to verify, did you verify that? His 
4 comment that he saw him at his waistband or shorts 
5 or shirt, did you look to see on Michael Brown's 
6 actual shirt or shorts if there is blood in that 
7 area? 
8 A There 1s both his shirt and his shorts are 
9 very bloody so. 
10 MS. ALIZADEH: It may be difficult to tell 
11 whether it was from that or from the body laying in 
12 the street and so forth. 
13 GRAND JUROR: When you interviewed Darren 
14 Wilson, did he at any time tell you how many times 
15 he thought he shot his weapon? 
16 A He didn't recall. And realistically in my 
17 experience that is a normal acceptable answer to 
18 hear from a police officer who has been involved 1n 
19 a critical incident. Very often police officers 
20 either don't know, or get the number of shots 
21 incorrect. And I don't see that as being something 
22 that frequently occurs. 
23 
24 
25 
Detective 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Did he mention it to 
1n the preliminary. 
In terms of how many shots? You would 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 95 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 have to ask Detective that. 
2 GRAND JUROR: For some reason I got he 
3 said he shot four times, four shots. 
4 A 
5 shots. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
A 
A 
I'm making reference to in terms of total 
GRAND JUROR: Uh-huh. 
Are you making reference to something? 
GRAND JUROR: Total shots, yeah. 
No. I mean, clearly, I think he probably 
10 could deduce that when he went back to the station 
11 that his weapon carries 12 rounds in the magaz1ne 
12 plus one in the chamber. And, you know, he can, 
13 obviously, I don't know that he did, count how many 
14 rounds he had left. But he didn't make reference 
15 to, he didn't know when I asked him. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: If you are looking for 
17 where that might come from, keep 1n mind that I had 
18 Sergeant testify about what he first told him, 
19 so you can review Sergeant 's testimony. We had 
20 testify about his cursory interview at 
21 the hospital, so you can review that. Neither one 
22 of those were recorded interviews keep in mind. And 
23 then there was the recorded interview with Detective 
24 , which you have that transcript. 
25 And then finally, Special Agent 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 96 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 testified that she interviewed him, but her 
2 interview was not recorded as well. So you wouldn't 
3 maybe, you could look back at the transcript of her 
4 testimony and then also keep in mind that Darren 
5 Wilson testified before this grand jury and you 
6 could review his testimony to see if there's mention 
7 of how many shots. 
8 
9 
A Yes, ma'am. 
GRAND JUROR: What is the policy and 
10 procedure of when a police officer goes to the 
11 hospital to be examined as far as who is present 1n 
12 the room with the patient and the doctor? 
13 A Well, I don't know that I can answer that 
14 question. Obviously, Ferguson Police Department may 
15 have their own policy in terms of how they handle a 
16 situation like that. I would say with St. Louis 
17 County, obviously, you would have the patient and I 
18 would assume that you would probably have a 
19 superv1sor there who is there to provide support to 
20 an injured officer. I'm just talking in general 
21 terms here, provide support to an injured officer. 
22 And you may have another police officer there aga1n 
23 to provide support or something needs to take place, 
24 but I can't specifically answer for Ferguson Police 
25 Department. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 97 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 GRAND JUROR: And they would be present in 
2 the examine room? 
3 
4 
5 
A 
A 
During any kind of exam1ne taking place? 
GRAND JUROR: (Nods head. ) 
My guess would be that would be up to each 
6 individual officer whether they were comfortable 
7 with a co-worker or a supervisor being present. 
8 Obviously, if they weren't 
9 comfortable, I'm sure a supervisor or co-worker 
10 would leave, but if they are comfortable, I'm sure 
11 they could stay too. 
12 GRAND JUROR: And when the doctor is 
13 exam1n1ng the patient, would there be a reason for 
14 the supervisor to be answering questions? 
15 A I guess it would probably depend on what 
16 type of questions they would be answering. 
17 
18 A 
GRAND JUROR: But they're not the patient? 
There is obviously an aspect to some sort 
19 of workman's camp or payment 1ssues or any number of 
20 things like that could arise that a superv1sor may 
21 take upon his, may take responsibility for. But 
22 specifically in any specific situation, I don't 
23 know. I think it would be entirely different. 
24 Obviously, just as if any of us got 
25 hurt 1n a work place environment, I'm sure a 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 98 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 supervisor and/or co-worker would be there to assist 
2 1n whatever way they could through the process. 
3 GRAND JUROR: I have one question, I have 
4 a couple of questions, one in particular is about 
5 his visit to the emergency room. It says in his 
6 triage report that the patient presented with St. 
7 Louis County Police to the emergency room for 
8 evaluation from home. 
9 And when we had somebody testify here, I 
10 just want, do you know if he went home first? 
11 A He did not go home. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
A He went to the Ferguson Police Department 
at the direction of Sergeant and he waited 
there until Detective 
obviously, Detective 
arrived. And, 
drove, not with, but 
17 followed Darren Wilson and I believe Colonel 
18 from the Ferguson police station to the 
19 emergency room. 
20 GRAND JUROR: Do you know where Darren 
21 Wilson lives, or what street, or what I'm trying to 
22 determine is how far away he lives from the 
23 hospital? 
24 
25 
A He lives quite a ways away. 
GRAND JUROR: I just want to make sure I 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 99 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 understand what you were trying to say earlier, I 
2 know everybody has asked some questions about some 
3 of the things he told us here versus some of the 
4 things he told you about. 
5 A Sure. 
6 GRAND JUROR: I want to make sure I'm 
7 understanding what you are say1ng because with my 
8 work I'll talk a certain way with my co-workers then 
9 I would with this guy right here. So I'm assuming 
10 that it is acceptable for things to be inferred, I'm 
11 a little nervous, it is acceptable to go unspoken 
12 that you know could have happened, that he would 
13 have to explain to us. 
14 
15 
16 
A Can you give me a specific example of what 
you are making reference to? 
GRAND JUROR: Several things. I can't 
17 remember what Sheila asked, but she asked a question 
18 and then he asked a question about did he say he was 
19 unarmed. He said, well, several times that his hand 
20 was still 1n his waistband and I can see where some 
21 people would say that he was holding an lnJury or 
22 something, but as a police officer, and as a fellow 
23 police officer, you don't know that's what he was 
24 doing, you think he could be, so you're taking as a 
25 police officer that doesn't have to be explained to 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 100 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 you. 
2 A Correct, I think just like it is in any 
3 industry or any line of work, I think there are 
4 obviously things that don't necessarily need to be 
5 explained or as you said, implied in any industry. 
6 And you make reference to the hand in 
7 the waistband. A hand in the waistband to me in a 
8 situation is an alarm in any given situation because 
9 I don't know as a police officer, I'm talking 1n 
10 general terms here now, I don't know is that 
11 person's hand cold or is it that they're going to 
12 pull out a knife or a gun or baton or whatever. 
13 GRAND JUROR: So it is possible that the 
14 difference is in things that he told you and the way 
15 he explained things how he told us could simply be 
16 you are a police officer and you know the situation, 
17 you know the type. 
18 A I think that's possible, yes. 
19 Specifically in the situation with the hand 1n the 
20 waist, I believe I knew what he was making reference 
21 to when he's talking about he makes mention to it 
22 four times, you know. 
23 
24 A 
GRAND JUROR: It 1s a concern? 
It was obviously a concern to him and to 
25 me as a police officer, it would be a concern to me 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 101 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 also. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me ask. I'm sure your 
3 lunch 1s here. If you want to follow-up with him 
4 after lunch, we can do that or you think there's 
5 another five minutes worth of questions we can try 
6 to finish with him. He's sticking around. 
7 If for some reason during lunch you want 
8 to ask him something else, you know, we'll bring him 
9 back. But I know your lunch is probably here. Is 
10 there anything press1ng right now that you want to 
11 ask him before break? 
12 GRAND JUROR: When you spoke with or 
13 interviewed Officer Darren Wilson, at that time was 
14 he represented by an attorney? 
15 
16 
A He was, yes. 
GRAND JUROR: At any time did his attorney 
17 say that there's certain things that you cannot ask 
18 him? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
A 
He did not, no. 
GRAND JUROR: He did not. 
No. As a matter of fact, I think during 
22 the course of the interview his attorney maybe said 
23 two words. 
24 GRAND JUROR: So he was present there with 
25 Darren Wilson? 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 102 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
A Yes, ma'am, yes. He was present in the 
conference room when we interviewed him. So it was 
myself, Detective , Darren Wilson, and Darren 
4 Wilson's attorney 1n the conference room. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Correct me if I'm wrong, I 
6 believe we've heard that his attorney was also 
7 present with him at the hospital? 
8 
9 
A He was, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Had actually ridden from 
10 the Ferguson Police Department with Colonel 
11 1n the car with Darren Wilson, correct? 
12 A I don't remember specifically if he was 1n 
13 the car, but he definitely was at the Ferguson 
14 Police Department and he definitely was at Christian 
15 Northwest Hospital with Darren Wilson, yes. 
16 GRAND JUROR: A public citizen or police 
17 officer walking down to the park, they're sitting 1n 
18 a car and they are strangled and beaten to death, 
19 that's a homicide and there is no weapon involved; 
20 1s that correct? Are physical hands ever a weapon 
21 or you beat me to death? 
22 A Is it a homicide? Yes. A homicide is 
23 simply a manner of death, but more specifically a 
24 homicide is a death at the hands of another person 
25 so yes, it would be a homicide. 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 103 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 
2 
3 
A 
GRAND JUROR: And hands would be a weapon? 
Could be absolutely, yes. 
GRAND JUROR: So I'm getting to the point 
4 this officer felt he was in danger of being beaten 
5 to death sitting in his car, you could almost say 
6 there was a weapon involved at that point, that's 
7 where I'm confused a little bit. I understand no 
8 weapon 1n the form of a pistol or handgun, if you 
9 are 1n danger, that your life was in danger that you 
10 are being beaten to death, is there a weapon there 
11 or not? 
12 A Well, there's a weapon 1n the sense there 
13 1s something in a hand? 
14 
15 
16 yes. 
17 
A 
GRAND JUROR: Right. 
No. Can you use your hands a weapons, 
GRAND JUROR: Right. There lS no 
18 requirement to see a physical weapon, gun, knife, 
19 for a police officer or citizen to defend themself, 
20 or 1n the case of a police officer to use deadly 
21 force. You don't need to see a handgun to defend 
22 yourself with deadly force if you are police 
23 officer, you assume your life is in danger by means 
24 other than a physical weapon? 
25 A If a police officer 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 104 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 MS. ALIZADEH: Let me stop you here. 
2 We're going to give you prior to your deliberations 
3 what the law states when a law enforcement officer 
4 can use force, when a person defending themselves 
5 can use force, and when they can use deadly force. 
6 And so, you know, this would be maybe his 
7 understanding of the law, but we have taken great 
8 pains to make sure we are go1ng to get you the law 
9 so that I don't want anybody to misinterpret it. 
10 I'm just going to stop you there and we'll give it 
11 to you before your deliberations okay? 
GRAND JUROR: Okay. 
So 
12 
13 GRAND JUROR: Kind of a follow-up on what 
14 he's say1ng. 
15 Due to Michael Brown's s1ze and demeanor, 
16 could Darren Wilson have considered him as a person 
17 as being a weapon? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: You know, these are all 
19 things there are, 1s the definition of deadly weapon 
20 including 1n there? 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: We can put it 1n there, 
22 deadly force is in there. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Here lS the thing. You all 
24 know from being a grand jury for several months, 
25 that there's, you know, for example, with armed 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 105 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 criminal action, you know, you have to have 
2 committed a crime by, with, through the use of a 
3 dangerous instrument, a deadly weapon and there are 
4 definitely definitions as to what is a deadly weapon 
5 and a dangerous instrument. 
6 I believe once you see the law that we've 
7 written, it talks about what a person, their 
8 reasonable belief 1s. And so those things that you 
9 are asking is, could a person reasonably believe 
10 that their life was threatened, that's the crux of 
11 what you all have to talk about. And again, it 1s 
12 necessarily appropriate for him to answer those 
13 questions, whether or not Darren Wilson could have 
14 reasonably felt that he was, his life was 1n danger 
15 1s something you all have to decide. And be guided 
16 by what the evidence is and then what the law is 
17 that Sheila and I have put together based on the 
18 statutes and criminal instructions and jury trials, 
19 okay. 
20 I don't want you to, I don't think it is 
21 appropriate for him to interpret the law. That's 
22 going to be your job and if you have questions about 
23 the law, because under the grand jury rules, we are 
24 your legal advisers. So if there are questions 
25 about the law as you are deliberating, you ask us 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 106 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 those questions because we are your legal advisers. 
2 GRAND JUROR: Without relation to the law, 
3 have you 1n your dealings as a police officer, ever 
4 seen anyone knocked out by one punched? 
5 A Have I personally seen it? No. Have I 
6 responded to calls where someone has been knocked 
7 out with one punch by a neighbor, a person at a bar? 
8 Yes. 
9 GRAND JUROR: Everything that they are 
10 talking about, I just want to get back to the basics 
11 of what happened or see what happened. Necessarily 
12 walking 1n the middle of the street is not that big 
13 of a deal, but when it got to the point, I've heard 
14 it described as a tussle, a struggle and everything 
15 like that, so when a citizen and a police officer 
16 are 1n a tussle, that's a crime by the person 
17 tussling with the police officer? 
18 
19 there. 
20 
21 
22 
MS. ALIZADEH: I'm going to stop you 
GRAND JUROR: Why? 
MS. WHIRLEY: We have a rule on that too. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Because there are 1ssues 
23 about who was the initial aggressor, whether or not 
24 the officer was making a lawful arrest, those are 
25 all things that the law will tell you. You can 
GorePerry Reporting & Video 314.241.6750 1.800.878.6750 107 
Grand Jury- Ferguson Police Shooting Grand Jury 11/21/2014 
1 consider whether you believe the officer's actions 
2 were lawful, and those are things that once you read 
3 the law. 
4 GRAND JUROR: So you are go1ng to g1ve us 
5 those guidelines for us? 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Right. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: We're not go1ng to g1ve you 
8 the facts and say if he did this and then this, if
