If I was out and he started like chasing

1 Q You are in a car, you are more mobile in a 
2 car than you are on foot, right?

Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Officer Wilson, I'm 
not trying get in your head, I mean, I guess we all 
are trying to get in your head at some point to know 
what you were thinking at the time, but, I mean, 
your initial confrontation or your initial contact 
with them, I mean, you didn't see any of them with 
14 weapons, correct? 
15 A No. 
16 Q And they weren't subjects that you knew to 
17 be armed and dangerous? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
No. 
And you stop and encounter pedestrians 
20 probably almost on a daily basis when you are on 
21 patrol, would that be fair to say? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so did you at that point have any 
24 reason to anticipate that this, that Michael Brown, 
25 the Michael Brown subject was going to provoke or

No, not at that moment, no. 
You described the first shot, was his

5 
6 
A 
Q 
I believe so. 
And then the second shot, was his body in 
7 contact with you on the second shot? 
8 A Probably not on the second one. I know 
9 when I first pulled the trigger it was, but it 
10 didn't shoot and then that's when I racked the gun 
11 and then shot again. 
12 Q And you used both hands, you had to use 
13 both hands to rack the gun? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Was he still trying to hit you when you 
16 went to rack the gun?

19 get the blood off your palm?

21 blood on my palm until I was driving back to the

1 ever just think about getting in that bad boy and

3 A No, I didn't. My thought is, I was still 
4 dealing with a threat at my car. You know, we're 
5 trained not to run away from a threat, to deal with 
6 a threat and that is what I was doing. That never 
7 entered my mind to flee.

9 do you recall grabbing Michael Brown by the throat?

1 process. You're in the car and someone, you're 
2 struggling, tugging back and forth, did you ever 
3 think that he had a gun right then and there, he 
4 could have used it at any time? 
5 A I wasn't thinking about that at that time. 
6 I was thinking about defending myself whenever he 
7 was hitting me in the car. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: 
9 So kind of going 
10 go on that as well. So the comment that you made to 
11 your supervisor Sergeant when he got there at 
12 the scene was that he went for my gun, I had to 
13 shoot him. I think that kind of goes along with 
14 that. Because I think when I hear someone say he 
15 went for my gun, if I literally take that comment, I 
16 would assume that someone literally went to your 
17 holster and tried to pull it out. Either 
18 unholstering it or literally taking it from you. 
19 And in this instance that was not the 
20 case. You had already unholstered and you were 
21 aiming at him. He essentially in his, your point of 
22 view and the point of view of who we can no longer 
23 obtain that, he deflected or pushed it towards you, 
24 but he did not at any point try to pull it from your 
25 holster is, I guess, my question?

10 complete control of that weapon at that time.

18 went there and his finger was in the process of

1 department, after you washed off and everything, did 
2 you ever think at what time that I need to write a 
3 report while it is fresh on my mind? 
4 A No. The protocol is whenever you are 
5 involved in a significant use of force, that you 
6 contact your FOP representative and then he will

8 are the clear head in that situation. They have not

19 nothing behind him. And after the first round of

3 little bit about what you did that morning when you 
4 were on duty. The day before, typical shift, were 
5 you off that day?

7 On August 8th?

3 So very short trip? 
A Yeah. 4 
5 And that was my thought 
6 too, but being in communication, I think, you know, 
7 in that situation, my first thought is to contact a

10 sort of communication from that point moving forward

1 A No, I haven't talked to the chief or 
2 anybody at the department in length about what 
3 happened. I told my sergeant what happened at that 
4 time, that was the end of our conversations with 
5 anybody from the department.

with 
A 
FBI agent; is that correct? 
Yes. 
11 Okay. At which time, I 
12 hope I'm getting this correct, I believe that there

And that would be

right? 
Okay. And they gave you a

11 whatever? 
12 
13 
A Yes. 
Okay. And you were 
14 required or they asked you to pick out Dorian 
15 Johnson at that time? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Were you able to pick him 
18 out at that time? 
19 A I selected who I believe was Dorian 
20 Johnson, they never confirmed if it was or not. 
21 They never did, okay. You 
22 don't know the results of that?

not in any way, are you? 
A No, I'm not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Prior to this incident, had 
4 you ever had any contact with any of the county 
5 detectives that you've met throughout this 
6 investigation? 
7 A No, I have not. 
8 Q Any of the agents, FBI agents or federal

10 A No, I have not. 
11 You felt like 
12 your life was in jeopardy when you were sitting in 
13 the vehicle?

1 something that we have not asked you that you want 
2 us to know or you think it is important for the 
3 jurors to consider regarding this incident? 
4 A One thing you guys haven't asked that has 
5 been asked of me in other interviews is, was he a 
6 threat, was Michael Brown a threat when he was 
7 running away. People asked why would you chase him 
8 if he was running away now. 
9 I had already called for assistance. 
10 If someone arrives and sees him running, another 
11 officer and goes around the back half of the 
12 apartment complexes and tries to stop him, what 
13 would stop him from doing what he just did to me to 
14 him or worse, knowing he has already done it to one 
15 cop. And that was, he still posed a threat, not 
16 only to me, to anybody else that confronted him. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: Any questions? 
18 Along those 
19 lines, you feel like as a police officer it is your 
20 obligation to follow that suspect? 
21 
22 
23 then. 
24 
A Yes, sir. 
MS. ALIZADEH: All right. If that's it
