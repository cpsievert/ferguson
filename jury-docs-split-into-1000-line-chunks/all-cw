2 Q Could you please state your name and spell 
3 it for the court reporter? 
4 A 
5 Q Urn, can you please tell me how you're 
6 employed? 
7 A I am a police officer with St. Louis 
8 County Police Department, assigned as a firearm and 
9 tool mark examiner in the crime laboratory. 
10 Q And so you originally received your 
11 training to be a police officer; is that right? 
12 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
When did you become a police officer? 
In early, I'm sorry, 1991. I became an 
15 officer commissioned and hired by St. Louis County 
16 and have not worked for any other departments. 
17 Q So as a police officer after your 
18 graduation from the academy and during your training 
19 with the academy, you learned how to use firearms, 
20 correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then at some point you went from being 
23 a uniformed officer to having this specialized area 
24 of tool marks and firearms examiner, correct? 
25 A That's correct.

1 Q So can you explain for the jurors, first 
2 of all, when is it that you went and got your 
3 training for that? 
4 A After four and a half years on patrol, I 
5 went into the Crime Scene Unit and was in the Crime 
6 Scene Unit for six and a half years. 
7 So approximately 2002 I was assigned 
8 in the crime laboratory, trained under other 
9 qualified firearm examiners, both on the job and 
10 through available training outside the laboratory by 
11 firearm manufacturers, ammunition manufacturers, ATF 
12 training opportunities, FBI training opportunities 
13 and so forth. Completed that training in 2004 and 
14 have been an examiner ever since, even becoming the 
15 supervisor of the section, I think, two and half, 
16 almost three years ago now. 
17 Q 
18 you said? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
So you began in the firearms lab in 2002 
Yes. 
So there's, you had approximately two 
21 years of training before becoming a firearms 
22 examiner? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A qualified examiner, yes. 
Now, to be a qualified examiner, do you 
25 have to have any type of certification or

1 qualification? 
2 A There are opportunities for certification 
3 through an international organization. They're not 
4 required, only a small percentage of examiners take 
5 that opportunity and I have not, so I am not 
6 certified through them, but I have been qualified 
7 both in state and federal courts numerous times as 
8 the expert witness. 
9 Q So for approximately ten years you've been 
10 working solely and strictly as a tool marks and 
11 firearms examiner for St. Louis County Police 
12 Department? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
And can you give me an estimate of how 
15 many times you have testified as an expert witness 
16 in that area in state and federal courts? 
17 A I wish I had counted them. Truthfully my 
18 best estimate would be dozens, not 50, but more than 
19 25. 
20 Q Okay. And in those cases, have you been 
21 qualified to testify as an expert in the field of 
22 tool marks and firearms examination? 
23 
24

Q 
Yes. 
So can you explain for the jurors,

3 A Uh-huh. 
4 Q The investigation into the shooting of 
5 Michael Brown. You were looking at firearms and 
6 ballistic materials; is that correct? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q Okay. So while it might be very 
9 interesting to talk about tool marks and what you do 
10 with them, let's skip that part of your expertise 
11 and we'll go straight to the firearms portion of it, 
12 is that all right?

Q

Now, in the laboratory setting at St. 
15 Louis County Police Department Crime Laboratory, are 
16 evidence items submitted to you for you to examine 
17 and test?

19 
A 
Q 
Yes, they are. 
And in this particular case, which is in 
20 relation to St. Louis County Police Department's 
21 Complaint Number 14-43984, were there items 
22 submitted to you for you to examine and test? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So first off, let's talk about a weapon.

1 and examine? 
2 A There was a firearm submitted for my 
3 examination, yes. 
4 Q And I say weapon, I guess that's pretty 
5 all inclusive. The weapon in particular is a 
6 firearm, correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q And you tested that weapon and compared it 
9 to some other materials that have been submitted to 
10 you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Did you put your conclusions in a report 
13 that you then gave to me?

A 
Q 
I did. 
All right. And I'm going to show you

21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. 
I'm going to pass this around so everybody 
23 can have a copy of that as well. So Officer

1 examination? 
2 A In this particular case, after opening the 
3 package to observe the weapon, firearm, I discovered 
4 that it had what appeared to be blood on it. In the 
5 interest of safety for myself and others that might 
6 handle this firearm after me, I cleaned it with 
7 bleach to kill any biohazards and remove that 
8 apparent blood from the firearm. 
9 
10 
Q Okay. So let's back up now. This weapon 
was submitted to you by Detective is 
11 that correct? 
12 A The seizing detective was 
13 From him it went to a secure vault that they have 
14 access to for dropping off evidence after hours. 
15 That vault is then accessed by Property Control 
16 Unit, and in this case , who is the 
17 supervisor of the Property Control Unit. Removed it 
18 from that vault and brought it to me. 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
So what day did you receive that firearm? 
October 11th of 2014. I'm sorry, did I 
21 say October? I meant August, I'm sorry. 
22 Q That would have been a Monday, correct, or 
23 maybe. If the 9th was a Saturday, that would make 
24 the 11th a Monday? 
25 A That sounds correct.

1 Q Can you describe how this weapon, this 
2 firearm was packaged and how you first saw it? 
3 A It was packaged in a box that we have 
4 specifically on our department for the storage of 
5 firearms and it is sealed with evidence tamperproof 
6 tape. In other words, if the tape is torn to open 
7 the package, you can tell by the tearing of the 
8 tape. 
9 And it is also itemized on an 
10 evidence receipt that accompanies that box. So its 
11 submission has some of the case information and the 
12 contents of the box listed thereon. 
13 Q Now, when you received the box, did you 
14 examine it to determine whether or not the tape that 
15 sealed the box had been tampered with? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
It was sealed when I received it. 
Had you noticed, or in any case when you 
18 noticed that there has been a tear in the evidence 
19 tape, would you notify the seizing detective 
20 immediately? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. So in this case, it appeared to 
23 still be intact, correct?

Q 
Yes. 
Was there anything unusual about the way

1 it was packaged? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Not to my recollection. 
Now, there has been testimony from 
Page 76 
4 Detective , and I'm just going to ask you to 
5 take my word on this, that when he first found the 
6 weapon or first got the weapon I'll say, that it had 
7 been packaged, so to speak. And he described to the 
8 jurors the way that was. 
9 The weapon had been placed in like an 
10 evidence envelope and the magazine and live round 
11 had been removed from the weapon and the slide had 
12 been locked in its back position. Did you see any 
13 evidence envelope with the box that you opened up, 
14 was there anything like that in there? 
15 A Truthfully, I don't recall, however, 
16 that's not unusual. So the answer to your earlier 
17 question anything unusual, no, because it's not 
18 infrequent that that does occur, especially the 
19 firearm being made safe and unloaded and the action 
20 locked up and so forth, that is actually a 
21 requirement of the laboratory that we not have 
22 loaded or unsafe firearms. 
23 Specifically in this case I don't 
24 recall an envelope, but if there was in that box, it 
25 would still be there today.

1 Q Okay. Whatever the condition it was in 
2 was not unusual to you? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q And, in fact, the St. Louis County Police 
5 Department's Crime Laboratory examines firearms and 
6 ballistic materials from any police department in 
7 St. Louis County that would submit them to you; is 
8 that fair to say? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes, including federal agencies, yes. 
And I would imagine, and I'm not sure, 
11 would it be fair to say that just different 
12 departments, they may have a different way of 
13 packaging a firearm? In other words, they might not 
14 use the same box that the county uses and so forth? 
15 A That's absolutely true. In fact, that's 
16 why it is not unusual because we have a requirement 
17 that the guns be boxed. It is for a safer storage 
18 and so forth, easier to store. 
19 Those agencies that will use those 
20 envelopes, when they arrive at our lab we will offer 
21 them boxes. It is not unusual to have that envelope 
22 in that box, no matter how they choose to submit it. 
23 Still other agencies will choose boxes very 
24 different from our own. Simply whatever they have 
25 available because then they meet the requirement of

3 
Q 
Detective 
Now, we have also heard testimony from 
that when he seizes a weapon, in 
4 order to package it and submit it for examination, 
5 that he would zip tie through the ejection port of 
6 the weapon in order to prevent that slide from 
7 moving. Did you notice if that had been done in 
8 this case? 
9 A I didn't pay particular attention to note, 
10 but every firearm is required to have a safety of 
11 some sort applied to it for its submission and that 
12 is the most common. And, in fact, when I'm done 
13 examining, I put on the very same zip tie. 
14 Q And then he also testified that he would 
15 use some kind of led identification number seal that 
16 he would put on the trigger guard of the weapon to 
17 mark it, so to speak, or number it. Is that also 
18 something that you use for sealing? 
19 A Absolutely, it's a led tab that has a 
20 steel wire coming from it. That led is manufactured 
21 for our department with our name on one side and 
22 forgive me, our number on one side that is unique. 
23 It is an incremental numbering system on those led 
24 seals. They are unique so they're not repeated. So 
25 that number, when that led wire goes through the

1 trigger back into the led and is crimped on with the 
2 led crimper, it embosses St. Louis County on it 
3 ideally. Then that is a unique number identifiable 
4 to that specific firearm and yes, I am very use to 
5 seeing those. 
6 Q All right. So when you first receive that 
7 weapon and you look at it, did it appear to be 
8 handled properly in your opinion, came to you at 
9 least in a condition that didn't raise any 
10 suspicions with you? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
13 weapon is? 
14 A 
Correct, I found it as I would expect to. 
Okay. So can you describe what this 
Yes, it is a pistol. It's made, as you 
15 can see on your copies, by Sig Sauer, Incorporated. 
16 They're located in Exeter, New Hampshire. This 
17 model is a P229 and the caliber of it is .40 Smith & 
18 Wesson. 
19 Again, it is a pistol, the finish I 
20 call black, that's mainly for the color. 
21 Manufacturer's have many different names for their 
22 finishing processes. We don't try to keep up with 
23 those. We simply try to know what color that finish 
24 is. It has six lands and groves with a left twist 
25 inside the barrel, and this firearm has serial

1 number 55B003794. 
2 Q All right. The things that you indicated 
3 just now about the weapon, are those things you can 
4 see in your visual examination of the weapon or did 
5 you have to like actually look through some kind of 
6 device in order to determine that it had six lands 
7 and grooves with a right side twist, I mean, a 
8 left-hand twist? 
9 A That is the interior of the barrel. It 
10 took some lighting to eliminate that. It can be 
11 seen with the naked eye, however, low power 
12 magnification is best. I have an eye loop, it is a 
13 jeweler's loop, it is only 5X, it is not very much 
14 at all. Like a magnifying glass, it is not very 
15 much at all. It makes it easier to see. So I can 
16 look into the barrel and determine the number of 
17 lands and groves and the direction of that twist. 
18 Q In regard to the caliber of the weapon, 
19 what does that mean? 
20 A The number is roughly the diameter from 
21 the raised area of the land on one side to the 
22 raised area of the land on the other side on the 
23 interior of the bullet. Interior diameter, if you 
24 will. 
25 Q The interior of the barrel?

1 A Of the barrel. However, that's not an 
2 exact measurement. There are different tolerances 
3 that the manufacturers have. The S & W after that 
4 number is Smith & Wesson is what that stands for. 
5 They developed that caliber, so .40 Smith & Wesson 
6 caliber is a name of this caliber of ammunition that 
7 this firearm is designed to fire. 
8 Q All right. And when you say that you 
9 cleaned the weapon of blood, did you do any testing 
10 on that to determine it was blood? 
11 A The testing of any blood or search for any 
12 fingerprints if it was necessary is all done before 
13 the firearm comes to me in the laboratory. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
Okay.

17 results.

Q 
Yes. 
Not this particular one, but the Sig Sauer 
24 .40 caliber pistol?

1 we are issued as county police officers. 
2 Q All right. And so after having cleaned 
3 the firearm, what do you do then to continue your 
4 examination of the weapon? 
5 A I then made note of these observations and 
6 then began to do some more observations and some 
7 simple tests to include determinating the capacity 
8 of a magazine that was submitted with the firearm 
9 and that was 12. 
10 The firearm has no safety, I took 
11 note of that. 
12 Q Is that unusual that a weapon of this type 
13 does not have a safety? Is it manufactured without 
14 a safety or is it somehow removed from the weapon? 
15 A This firearm and many others have internal 
16 safeties and when we speak of a safety, we are 
17 referring specifically to an external safety that 
18 can be applied by the person possessing the firearm. 
19 There are no external safeties on this firearm, but 
20 there was never designed to be. It was not removed 
21 from this weapon, it is simply not present. 
22 Q Okay. And so then you also indicated 
23 there was a magazine submitted with this weapon, 
24 correct? 
25 A Yes.

1 Q Can you describe for the grand jurors what 
2 is a magazine, it is not People or Time, obviously, 
3 but what was the magazine that was submitted to you? 
4 A Some people call it a clip, but it's that 
5 detachable part of the firearm that contains the 
6 ammunition. You can load it with as many as you 
7 like up to its capacity and in this case as many as 
8 12 live cartridges inside the magazine. The 
9 magazine when you desire, when you use your desires, 
10 would seep into that firearm and lock into it and 
11 contain that ammunition. 
12 The firing cycle, it would take 
13 individual cartilages to load and fire from that 
14 magazine. And to continue to do so as many times as 
15 you fire it until the ammunition supply is 
16 exhausted. 
17 Q So the magazine that was submitted to you, 
18 was it empty as submitted to you? 
19 A We receive it in both manners, where it is 
20 loaded and unloaded. I don't remember at the moment 
21 if he unloaded the magazine or not. 
22 Q Do you recall if there were any live 
23 rounds that were submitted with this weapon? 
24 A I did have one live cartridge submitted 
25 with the magazine and firearm.

1 Q So now I called it a round and you just 
2 called it a cartridge. Can you describe for the 
3 grand jurors what you mean by a cartridge? 
4 A A cartridge is the unfired ammunition. It 
5 is a live cartridge where the primer is ready to be 
6 fired, I'm sorry, there is gunpowder contained in 
7 the cartridge case. And the bullet is seated in the 
8 mouth of that cartridge case. Again, it is unfired. 
9 A round is a interchangeable term if 
10 you will, perhaps a layperson's term. It can mean 
11 the same thing, but among fire examiners the 
12 definition of that is a live cartridge. 
13 Q What else did you note about this weapon 
14 that you indicated in your report. You have here 
15 trigger pull SA, not applicable. What does that 
16 mean? 
17 A Trigger pull single action and next to 
18 that is DA, for double action, I put not applicable 
19 because I did not test the different trigger pulls 
20 that firearm has. It is a measurement taken in 
21 pounds. And the reason why I did not report that is 
22 because it can vary. One pull of the trigger might 
23 be 5 pounds and the next one might be 7 pounds. 
24 Unless it becomes a key element in the case, it is 
25 simply too variable to have much meaning to me and

1 for me to testify to it. It is seemingly 
2 unimportant. 
3 Q So in that case where someone says I was 
4 holding the weapon and I barely touched the trigger 
5 might be relevant, but in this case it was not; is 
6 that correct? 
7 A To my understanding, correct. There is no 
8 denial of firing the weapon, there is no question of 
9 how long the trigger pull might have been and things 
10 of that nature, so it was not recorded. 
11 Q And then CYL and CYL rotation, what do 
12 those terms mean? 
13 A CYL is standing for cylinder. And that is 
14 for a revolver type weapon, this is a pistol, so it 
15 does not have that cylinder, so it is not 
16 applicable. 
17 Q All right. And then you described the 
18 barrel length in inches; is that correct? 
19 A That's correct, three and three quarter 
20 inches. 
21 Q And then muzzle trigger length you have 
22 NA, is that because it is a short pistol as opposed 
23 to a long gun? 
24 A That's correct. That's more intended for 
25 the overall length of firearms. Sometimes that

1 length becomes an issue in the application of 
2 statutes. For example, sawed off gun, it has to be 
3 a certain length to be legal. And if it is any 
4 shorter than that, the measurement would have been 
5 taking there. 
6 Q Now, we've described the action of this 
7 weapon or firearm as being semiautomatic. 
8 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
What does that mean? 
Semiautomatic pistols fire one bullet, 
11 fire one cartridge with each pull of the trigger. 
12 So if you pulled that trigger one time, even if you 
13 hold it back and don't release it, it is only going 
14 to fire the one time. You have to release the 
15 trigger then until it resets internally and then if 
16 you pull that trigger again, assuming you have more 
17 ammunition it would then fire again. 
18 But again, it only fires one time 
19 with each pull of the trigger. 
20 Q Now, you described in this case the 
21 magazine that was submitted to you as having a 
22 capacity of 12 cartridges. Can this weapon, when 
23 the magazine is seated in the handle of the weapon, 
24 can it have more than 12 cartridges and be fully 
25 loaded.

1 A Yes. If you were to seat the magazine and 
2 work the action of the firearm, open the slide, 
3 release the slide, it would feed that top cartridge 
4 from the magazine into the chamber of the barrel. 
5 If you remove that magazine, and you have 11 in it, 
6 if you put another one in it. So it is now again at 
7 capacity with 12, reseat that magazine, you now have 
8 a total of 13 live cartridges available to be fired 
9 in that magazine, I'm sorry, in that firearm without 
10 reloading it again. 
11 Q And you identified the cartridge, the live 
12 round I called it, but the cartridge that you were 
13 submitted, you've listed as one Federal JHP, what 
14 does that mean? 
15 A The Federal is the marketed name stamped 
16 on the head stamp or on the base, if you will. If 
17 you stand that cartridge up on the bottom, it says 
18 Federal, that's who markets that ammunition. And 
19 JHP stands for Jacketed Hollow Point, that is the 
20 style of the bullet that's loaded into that 
21 cartridge case. 
22 Q And the cartridge that was submitted to 
23 you, is this the type and caliber of a cartridge 
24 that could be fired from that weapon? 
25 A It is. I did not note the caliber next to

1 that cartridge because it is the same caliber that 
2 the firearm is designed to fire. Sometimes 
3 ammunition that is submitted differs from the 
4 firearm, but I note when it is different here. And 
5 because there is no such note. I know that that is 
6 a .40 Smith & Wesson caliber cartridge. 
7 Q All right. You also indicated that you 
8 had been submitted five bullets. Can you explain 
9 what is a bullet, how is a bullet different from a 
10 cartridge? 
11 A The cartridge is the combination of all 
12 the elements needed to fire a weapon. The primer in 
13 the cartridge case that contains the gunpowder and 
14 the bullet. 
15 So when you're firing a cartridge, a 
16 firing pin strikes the primer, which is a very small 
17 explosive. So that sets off that explosion, that 
18 miniature explosion sends fire into the open chamber 
19 of that cartridge case where the gunpowder is. 
20 So that fire then ignites the 
21 gunpowder. It doesn't detonate, which means to burn 
22 instantly, it burns rapidly, it deflagrates, which 
23 means it creates pressure. So that pressure that is 
24 created by the burning gunpowder is the same 
25 pressure that pushes the bullet out of that

1 cartridge case through the barrel towards its 
2 target. 
3 Q And then the bullet is the piece that 
4 comes out of the barrel of the gun and is what we 
5 normally think of as a bullet, it is what it shoots 
6 at targets or things? 
7 A Correct. In this case, for example, the 
8 submitted cartridge is a jacketed hollow point 
9 bullet. So that bullet would leave the cartridge 
10 case after having been fired, go through the barrel 
11 of the firearm. It's designed to make minimal, but 
12 contact with the lands and groves in that barrel to 
13 impart spin to the bullet so that when it leaves the 
14 barrel, it's a spinning bullet in flight now. 
15 The purpose of that is if you think 
16 of the analogy of a football, if you throw a spiral 
17 football, it will go farther and more accurately 
18 then an end over end football. It is the same 
19 principles at work here. If the bullet is spinning, 
20 it will go farther and more accurately than 
21 tumbling. That rifling is what gives it that 
22 stability. 
23 Q So the bullet is forced through the barrel 
24 of the gun, what happens to then the rest of the 
25 cartridge?

The energy that pushes that bullet out the 
2 barrel is equal, but opposite on that cartridge 
3 case. And in essence on the gun in the shooter's 
4 hand itself. That's the recoil that you see in 
5 cowboy movies. 
6 That cartridge case after it has 
7 fired that bullet, it is marked in several ways by 
8 that firearm. First, as I mentioned the firing pin 
9 striking that primer will leave a mark. 
10 The pleasure from the firing process 
11 pushing that cartridge case rearward against the 
12 breech of the firearm impresses the contours of that 
13 breach into the surface of that fired cartridge 
14 case. 
15 In this case, speaking of pistols, 
16 the action of the firearm is intended to extract 
17 that fired cartridge case from the chamber. So 
18 there is a little hook on the firearm that grabs the 
19 rim of that fired cartridge case and pulls it out, 
20 pulls it rearward of that chamber as it is pulled 
21 rearward then it is designed to hit what's called an 
22 ejector. It is nothing more than a little piece 
23 that when that cartridge case is pulled rearward, it 
24 hits that ejector to deflect it out of the open side 
25 of that slide of the firearm.

1 So to answer your question in a short 
2 order, after firing the bullet, the cartridge case 
3 is ejected from the pistol and then before the 
4 action closes, it needs the next cartridge from the 
5 magazine to reload it if there is one available. 
6 Q So, what you just described from pulling 
7 the trigger and the firing pin hitting the cartridge 
8 and the bullet being expelled from the gun and the 
9 casing coming out and the next cartridge being 
10 loaded up into the firing position, is that called a 
11 cycle, is that the firing cycle? 
12 A Yes. 
13 Q And that happens at one pull of the 
14 trigger, correct? 
15 A That will happen with each pull of a 
16 trigger on a semiautomatic pistol like this. 
17 Q So it doesn't require someone actually 
18 pulling the slide back in order to cause the gun to 
19 cycle again? 
20 A No, it doesn't. In fact, if you were to 
21 that, you would be ejecting a live cartridge and not 
22 have as much firing capacity because you would be 
23 wasting your ammunition. 
24 Q Can you explain, because there has been 
25 testimony perhaps that when this weapon was fired

1 during the incident of August 9th, that the officer 
2 pulled the trigger on a couple of different times

4 weapon yourself?

A 
Q

Q 
I did. 
Was it normal, did it fire normally? 
Yes, I noted no defects at all. 
Is there anything that you can explain 
9 that would have happen that would cause a weapon to 
10 not fire the cartridge if on this weapon pulled the 
11 trigger back? 
12 A To be clear, you're asking for speculation 
13 or generally speaking, correct. 
14 Q Sure, right. I know you don't know what 
15 happened in this case. 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I'm just asking you what could possibly be 
18 the reasons that you could pull the trigger and the 
19 weapon wouldn't fire? 
20 A Okay. Sometimes ammunition is simply bad 
21 ammo, maybe the primer doesn't have a priming 
22 compound in it. So no matter how many times you 
23 strike it, it is not going to fire. 
24 Sometimes a firearm might fail to 
25 feed a cartridge from the magazine, so you might try

1 to cycle it and it doesn't feed that cartridge, so 
2 there is no cartridge in it to fire. 
3 There are other scenarios if you are 
4 successful firing one cartridge, but it fails to 
5 extract, in other words, the hook doesn't grab the 
6 rim and pull it out or if it fails to eject and it 
7 pulls out from that hook, but it doesn't eject 
8 before the action closes on it. It might have it 
9 standing to where the open end of that fired 
10 cartridge case pointing up and out of the gun, they 
11 call it a stovepipe, like a stovepipe on the top of 
12 your house. 
13 Another factor might be in some way 
14 the action is impeded during the firing process. 
15 Perhaps unimpeded a firearm and ammunition might all 
16 be in perfect working condition, but if there was 
17 something blocking the action to where it couldn't 
18 cycle freely, then it might cause some of these 
19 other events to occur, especially not being able to 
20 fire after one shot because it wasn't allowed to 
21 cycle enough to feed the next one. There could be 
22 many others.

24 particular weapon, when you fire it, I don't know 
25 that this is the technical term for it, but the
