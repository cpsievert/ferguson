8 color to a yellow issue color, correct? 
A Yes. 9 
10 
11 
Q Do all bruises go through that continuum? 
A No, it really depends on the area. It 
12 also depends on the severity of the initial injury. 
13 So sometimes it can start as just a mild redness and 
14 then it resolves or it can go through the color 
15 stages of red to purple, blue and then fading to 
16 green and yellow. 
17 Q Did you notice any swelling to Darren 
18 Wilson face? 
A Nothing significant, no. 19 
20 Q Okay. And, obviously, probably we've all 
21 seen pictures and you've probably seen in real life 
22 when someone, like the entire side of their face is 
23 swollen, that would be something very evident and 
24 apparent, correct? 
25 A Correct.

1 Q Are there times when people may have some 
2 slight swelling, but you can't tell if that might, 
3 they have a chubby face or that's just the way their 
4 face looks normally, for example? 
5 A Correct. Several times patients will come 
6 in complaining of swelling and it is just not 
7 evident to us because we don't see what their normal 
8 tissue looks like on a normal day. So if he 
9 complained of any swelling, it wasn't noticeable

16 cause a contusion?

20 contusion on your face?

5 consistent with having been scratched? 
6 A Yes, there were several linear marks,

does that look like the patient you 
that day? 
Yes. 
Is that how he appeared when you saw him? 
Yes. 
Did you seize any specimens from him by 
12 any chance or take anything from him? 
13 A He submitted a urine drug screen, not to 
14 us, but to an outside company called Guardian that 
15 we contact for work related injuries.

17 he was on duty, correct?

And so that's considered a work related

1 Q Okay. And so did you or another nurse 
2 take his urine sample when he was there? 
3 A No. A representative from the company 
4 Guardian comes into the department and handles that 
5 full aspect of it. 
6 Q And the testing of the urine sample is 
7 done by that company? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then I'm just going to show you some 
10 pictures that have been taken while he was at the 
11 hospital, do you note any of the redness in any of 
12 these pictures in particular that help to 
13 demonstrate what you saw that day? 
14 A Yeah, his primary complaint was to the 
15 right side of the jaw, and so you can see a little 
16 bit of redness there and a little bit of redness 
17 there. We didn't notice any issues to the left side 
18 of the jaw. 
19 Q Did he complain of pain to the left side 
20 of the jaw? 
21 A Very, very mild pain to the left side of 
22 the jaw.

A 
Q 
Correct. 
Are there any of these images where they 
7 depict the injuries that you describe or that are 
8 shown that we might use? 
9 A A little bit of redness here at the 
10 hairline. It is a little difficult to see in the 
11 photograph the actual kind of linear marks that I 
12 saw during the examine, but you can kind of see some 
13 lines developing with the redness. 
14 Q Okay. And so you were pointing out Image 
15 Number 12 as showing the redness of the hairline? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q And was it in this area that you saw the 
18 linear marks?

5 the hairline, right?

A No. 
Q Did he talk about any pain in that area? 
A Nothing of significance, no.

10 
11 Q Now, and I talked to you just briefly 
12 before this and I told you that Officer Wilson was 
13 photographed, similar photographs were taken of him, 
14 I believe, on the 13th, which would have been 
15 actually on the 12th. And I asked you, we talked 
16 about bruising and how bruises appear and how long 
17 it takes bruises to appear. 
18 In these photographs do you see any 
19 apparent bruising that might demonstrate that is 
20 consistent with your diagnosis of a contusion? 
21 A It appears the redness that he had 
22 initially has resolved. I don't see any of the 
23 purple discoloration that sometimes follows 
24 contusions.

1 redness three days, I'm not sure what time those 
2 pictures were taken, but let's just say roughly 
3 three days after the injury resulted or occurred, 
4 does that change your opinion as to the diagnosis? 
5 A No, because it will not always progress to 
6 that point that it turns into that distinctive 
7 purple bruising that we are used to seeing. 
8 Q You still, in your opinion, is the same 
9 that you've diagnosed Darren Wilson with a contusion 
10 of his mandible? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And he was x-rayed and there is no 
13 fracture or any other injuries to his jaw or face;

Right, yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, do you have 
MS. WHIRLEY: Urn, yes. Progressing from 
19 redness to the face to bruising, which you looked at 
20 the photos of him a couple of days later and there 
21 was no bruising according to the photos, and you 
22 only saw redness on the face, correct, no bruising? 
23 A Correct.

25 of the face to a bruise, would that depend on the

Page 86 
1 impact, how hard a person is struck? 
2 A Yes. You know, generally the harder the 
3 impact, the more blood vessel involvement. So a 
4 bruise is caused by broken blood vessel. So the 
5 harder the punch, the harder the impact, the more 
6 likely you are to have more blood vessels being 
7 broken. And that's when those blood vessels start 
8 to bleed, that's what creates that purple 
9 discoloration as that blood kind of seeps out 
10 underneath the layer. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: If the face is red, but 
12 never turns purple, does that mean that the impact 
13 was not hard enough to break any blood vessels? 
14 A It was likely that the impact just 
15 involved the very superficial capillary layers, as 
16 opposed to deeper tissue which would result in the 
17 deeper purple bruising. 
18 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. I don't think I heard

1 his eyes at all? 
2 A No, he did not complain of any eye pain or 
3 nose pain or tooth pain or any head pain. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Head pain you said. 
5 A No head pain. There was no evidence of 
6 any injury to these areas. 
7 MS. WHIRLEY: So in your opinion there are 
8 no permanent injuries? 
9 
10 
A Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: And you said there were no 
11 fractures. Would he have needed to take time off 
12 because of the injury that he was treated for? 
13 A No. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: No. And as far as the 
15 document saying that he was injured by being 
16 stricken or however it is phrased, that is his 
17 self-reporting, correct? 
18

Could you see redness of the face?

2 MS. WHIRLEY: Based on what he told you, 
3 self-reporting? 
4 A Yes. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: I could get redness to the 
6 face from several different ways or mechanism?

17 A Yes.

21 concerned about that home answer on the application.

2 Road. 
3 A On Graham Road, yes. 
4 So you are right across the 
5 street from the physician building? 
6 A Yes, yeah. 
7 You said the area and the 
8 severity of the injury can be affected by how the 
9 bruise continues to manifest itself, correct? 
10 A Yes, a worsening, a deeper bruise 
11 typically indicates a more severe injury. 
12 And Naprosyn is an 
13 anti-inflammatory drug. 
14 A Yes. 
15 So with the application of 
16 ice, what you told him to do, apply ice. 
17 A Yes. 
18 And consumption of an 
19 anti-inflammatory also have an affect on how the 
20 bruising would manifest itself? 
21 A Yes. So the sooner ice is applied, the 
22 sooner anti-inflammatory medicines are taken, the 
23 more likely that a bruise or injury would resolve 
24 sooner than if no treatment were taken.

1 anti-inflammatory drug while he was there? 
2 A Yes, he was given a single dose of 
3 Naprosyn. 
4 And a single dose is 500 
5 milligrams? 
6 A Yes. 
7 And that's stronger than 
8 anything you can buy, you can't buy Naprosyn over 
9 the counter? 
10 A No. 
11 That's very close to 
12 Ibuprofen? 
13 A It is. It was Aleve, so basically

A Yes, there was no swelling that was seen.

A Just the redness. Naprosyn is also a pain 
21 reliever. So even without any evidence with his

23 something similar.

1 you ask a patient for pain, kind of how that relates 
2 to what they feel versus what you as a professional 
3 can evaluate? 
4 A The pain scale, is that what you mean? 
5 
6 A 
Yes. 
That is very subjective. So that the way 
7 that it is worded generally is, rate your pain on a 
8 scale of one to ten, ten being the worse pain that 
9 you've ever experienced or could ever imagine 
10 experiencing. So for someone who has never 
11 experienced much pain in their life may have what 
12 others would call relatively mild pain, but still 
13 may be the worst pain that they personally ever 
14 experienced. They may rate it on a higher scale. 
15 So it very much differs from 
16 person to person. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Nothing that a doctor or 
19 nurse no matter their education or training could 
20 disagree with or agree with? 
21 A It is not, there's no set guidelines as

17 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
18 I have a question. 
19 Considering that you did give Naprosyn, did you feel 
20 that there was a need to prescribe an 
21 anti-inflammatory instead of just a pain killer, did 
22 you feel that the injuries looked like, you know, an 
23 anti-inflammatory was needed? 
24 A Yeah, given the injury. Usually, whether 
25 it be a contusion or a sprain or a strain, we do try

1 to do anti-inflammatory medicines versus like a 
2 narcotic pain reliever. Simply because it does have 
3 that anti-inflammatory effect, which generally helps 
4 with the pain and helps resolve the injury a little 
5 bit more. 
6 I kind of secondarily prescribe 
7 Naprosyn versus a narcotic because I knew that he 
8 was going to be submitting a urine drug screen and I 
9 did not want something that I gave him to interfere 
10 with that. 
11 Did you feel his injuries 
12 were consistent with the need to have an 
13 anti-inflammatory drug? 
14 A Yes. 
15 At any time did Darren 
16 Wilson mention he had already seen an EMT? 
17 A No, he did not. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anyone else?

20 MS. ALIZADEH: So Kathi Alizadeh, it is 
21 about two minutes after 2:00. We just finished with 
22 the last witness of the day and you were scheduled 
23 to be here till 2:30. I think it is a good idea if 
24 you want to cut out now. 
25 We talked off the record earlier today

1 about scheduling and things that you might need 
2 because as we all have said, we're getting close to 
3 the end. Did you have a chance to talk during your 
4 lunch hour about whether or not you thought you 
5 might want some additional evidence or witnesses 
6 that you haven't heard yet or seen yet or whether or 
7 not you want to recall any witnesses that you've 
8 already heard from that you now have questions for? 
9 Did you all talk about that at all? 
10 We haven't talked about, I 
11 don't think there is anybody at this point. It is 
12 possible when we start getting into the 
13 deliberations that, you know, if there is a 
14 controversy, we may want to recall somebody. I 
15 would not expect that to be the case. 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Here is our plan. Y'all 
17 are here Thursday till 5:00. As I mentioned 
18 previously, Dr. is going to be here and I 
19 think he's going to be here at 8:30. He will be the 
20 first witness of the day. We still are trying to 
21 track down up to five lay people that may or may not 
22 show up on Thursday. 
23 And then, of course, we talked about 
24 Detective being kind of the last witness who 
25 would wrap things up and kind of summarize and

1 answer any leftover questions that you might have 
2 about the investigation. 
3 I didn't realize when we started up that 
4 we didn't have all 12 grand jurors, we weren't 
5 hearing evidence, we were just talking about the end 
6 of the day has come and that if any additional 
7 witness or evidence I need you to get that to me as 
8 soon as possible. 
9 Thursday at 8:30 we are going to start 
10 
11 
with Dr. We may have some lay witnesses if I 
can find them, then may be testifying if 
12 we have the time, he's going to be the last witness 
13 of the grand jury. 
14 And then you may or may not if Thursday is 
15 our last day, you may or may not begin your 
16 deliberations then. And as I said before, you know, 
17 the end of the day is at 5:00. You want to keep 
18 going until 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, it doesn't 
19 matter to us. We're here, be here as long as you 
20 need. 
21 If you do not begin deliberations that day 
22 or if you don't complete your deliberations that 
23 day, the next day you have scheduled is the 
24 following Friday, a week, a little more than a week 
25 after that. So that would be right now the plan is

1 that if we don't finish the evidence, we will see 
2 you on that following Friday. 
3 If we do finish the evidence, it will 
4 begin deliberations and continue or you'll come back 
5 the following Friday. Is that a plan that everybody 
6 is okay with? Okay. 
7 In the meantime, I know you have asked for 
8 someone to help you in your deliberations. 
9 Obviously, things to write with and things to put on 
10 the wall. Did they show you the thing we are going 
11 to put on the wall? 
12 It is a like this, it is big enough to 
13 push pins into, but it is bigger than that. I think 
14 we might try to put a couple of these two things 
15 right here. And then if you need more, we'll get 
16 more. 
17 We're going to have a flip chart, we have 
18 the easel which is excellent and then we'll give 
19 you, you know, Posted Notes, push pins, everything 
20 else. If you want different color highlighters 
21 because you are doing that, we'll get you whatever 
22 you need. 
23 And with that, any questions at the end of 
24 the day as we are coming to a close? 
25 Also the charges, what do

1 you call them? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We're going to do that 
3 tomorrow, because we didn't have time last night and 
4 today we started up with this. Either the rest of 
5 today or by tomorrow we will give to you for 
6 indictments for you to consider and then we'll give 
7 you the law on self-defense because we've already 
8 given you the excessive force or the use of force 
9 statute. 
10 Anything else? 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: We still talking about the 
12 probable cause and that standard. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: We had a conversation with 
14 that even last night and we still have to kind of 
15 work that out, we're not really sure. 
16 Probable cause, you are 
17 still looking at? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: We both agree that you 
19 can't return an indictment unless you believe there 
20 is probable cause to believe that a crime occurred 
21 and that the defendant or suspect or the person 
22 you're considering committed it. But the question 
23 is, if you're going to consider self-defense and use 
24 of lawful use of force to affect an arrest are 
25 affirmative defenses and they're what we call

1 complete defenses. 
2 And so if you believe that the person 
3 acted in lawful self-defense or if you believe the 
4 person was justified in the use of force as a law 
5 enforcement officer, then it is a complete defense, 
6 there would be no indictment on any charge. 
7 The question we don't really know is that 
8 beyond a reasonable doubt, what is the standard by 
9 which you have to consider that. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Those two issues. 10 
11 Will that be outlined in 
12 writing for us as well? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't know because we 
14 don't know. If this matter were a trial, it would 
15 be different because, obviously, in trial it is 
16 beyond a reasonable doubt. And in trial it is the 
17 obligation of the defense to raise the issue, and if 
18 the issue is raised, it becomes the obligation of 
19 the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
20 the person did not act in lawful self-defense or was 
21 not justified in the use of force, but that's in a 
22 trial setting. 
23 So we don't know how this, this 
24 investigation was, we talked about yesterday, is not 
25 typical on how we would present cases to the grand

1 jury. This is an investigation and I believe, and I 
2 think Sheila agrees, I don't want to speak for you, 
3 that your determination of whether or not force was 
4 justified either as self-defense or use of force to 
5 affect an arrest is a part of your decision process. 
6 So that's something for you to consider. 
7 I don't think the answer is simply, well, we believe 
8 that a crime was committed, you know, probable cause 
9 to believe a crime was committed and he did it and 
10 not at all talk about those defenses. 
11 But I don't know, we don't know what kind 
12 of instruction to give you on, do you have to 
13 believe that there's probable cause to believe that 
14 he used excessive force. I don't know, we don't 
15 know that. We don't want to tell you the wrong 
16 thing. So we're still trying to work that out. 
17 Okay. I hope I haven't said too much. We 
18 want you to make the right decision, we want your 
19 decision to be based on the law. And given that 
20 neither Sheila nor I have ever had this experience 
21 before and actually, we talked, there's only been 
22 one grand jury investigation on officer's use of 
23 force in the past 15 years that anybody can 
24 remember, so we're kind of not sure how to proceed.

4 We are your legal advisers under the law,

6 Of course, presenting all the evidence that we can
