Yes. 
Was he covered with a sheet at that time? 
Yes. 
Did you see any emergency vehicles that 
7 were nonpolice officers vehicles at that time 
8 firetrucks, ambulances or anything of that nature? 
9 A In the scene itself, no. I couldn't say 
10 outside of the scene, there may have been. 
11 Q Okay. Was the scene already taped off 
12 when you got up there? 
13 A It was. 
14 Q And you said there were a number of people 
15 on foot, or pedestrians that were in the area? 
16 A Correct. 
17 Q Can you describe how many and what the 
18 mood or the, what was going on when you got up 
19 there? 
20 A Sure. The area was essentially taped off 
21 using yellow crime scene tape. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
You can use this laser pointer. 
For example, if you look here at Building 
24 18, and you look at Building 17, the tape would have 
25 been draped from 17 to 18. And then I believe from

2 across this general direction where Canfield Drive 
3 and the circle area of Canfield Drive meet, and then 
4 down roughly, again, down around to Building 18.

6 used, sometimes vehicles were used, sometimes trees

Was Darren Wilson's vehicle still on the 
It was. 
Was his vehicle in the crime scene? 
It was. 
And to your knowledge, was his vehicle in 
17 the same place where it was when he stopped the 
18 vehicle and eventually got out of the car? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
All right. And so was there any 
21 discussion amongst your squad and your supervisor 
22 about how, well, how was it decided that you would 
23 be assigned to be the primary case officer on this? 
24 A I volunteered. My caseload was at the 
25 time what I considered lower than the other

1 detectives who were working, so I volunteered to 
2 take it. 
3 Q You said I'll handle this? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q So from that point on, are you directing 
6 the investigation? 
7 A For the most part, yes. 
8 Q And as the primary officer, do you get 
9 information from other detectives about what they 
10 are doing? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And do you assign other detectives or 
13 other police officers tasks or responsibilities or 
14 duties in the investigation?

Yes. 
And do you relay information that you are

And so how long were you up at the scene 
I would say I left roughly 7:00p.m. 
And you're aware that the shooting 
23 actually took place shortly, and I mean within 
24 minutes after the noon hour that day, correct?

1 Q And so, and you're aware that the body of 
2 Michael Brown actually laid on the roadway for 
3 several hours, as much as four or four and a half 
4 hours before it was eventually removed and 
5 transported to the Medical Examiner's Office, 
6 correct? 
7 A Correct. 
8 Q In your experience as a crime scene, well, 
9 as a detective, is that longer than usual? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No. 
Was there anything going on at the scene 
12 that inhibited or complicated the crime scene 
13 investigation that was going on? 
14 A Absolutely, yes. 
Q And what was that? 15 
16 A The crowd who essentially was standing 
17 around the crime scene tape on all points was upset, 
18 they were yelling obscenities on a regular basis at 
19 police, they were threatening to kill the police. 
20 At one point gunshots were fired from 
21 an area relatively close to the crime scene and I 
22 couldn't say exactly, but I would say it came from 
23 roughly this area right in here around Building 16 
24 and 17. 
25 There were people who were attempting

1 to breach the crime scene, meaning go under the 
2 crime scene tape for whatever reason. That happened 
3 on several occasions. It was a very chaotic scene. 
4 It was a scene that I had never experienced anything 
5 like that. 
6 Q Now, you mention that when you got there, 
7 you didn't have a bulletproof vest on. Was there a 
8 decision at sometime for you and your fellow police 
9 officers to put on a bulletproof vest? 
10 A After those gunshots were fired, we all 
11 returned to our cars where we keep our vest and we 
12 put our vest on. 
13 Q Other than the vest, did you have any 
14 other protective gear, like did you have those riot 
15 helmets with the face shields?

17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A

I did not. 
Any batons that you were carrying? 
No. 
Did you see other officers on the scene 
20 that were dressed in riot gear? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Riot gear, no. 
Did you see, and you've heard people talk 
23 about that there were dogs on the scene? 
24 A Initially, no. As the incident 
25 progressed, yes, dogs were requested.

8 scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
That's correct. 
Why were dogs requested to respond to the 
In an attempt to secure the scene. 
Okay. At about what time was it that the 
11 decision was made to request canine units respond? 
12 A I couldn't say exactly, but at the time 
13 the gunshots went off we realized that we were 
14 dealing with a very volitate situation and request 
15 from several different units within the police 
16 department were made for assistance in securing the 
17 scene and in protecting the officers who were out 
18 there. 
19 Q Now, we've already heard testimony from 
20 officers who were involved in processing the crime 
21 scene and in your, how many years have you been a 
22 detective? 
23 A Roughly eight.

1 investigating? 
2 A It would be a complete guess, 60, 70, 
3 maybe. 
4 Q So you're familiar with the job and the 
5 duties that a crime scene, or we call them the ID 
6 unit, you're familiar with what they do when they 
7 arrive at a crime scene, correct? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
I am. 
And would it be fair to say that they, as 
10 the crime scene investigator, they consider that, 
11 that that's their scene to control, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Did you make the decision on who was to be 
14 the crime scene detective in charge of that scene 
15 that day? 
16 A I did not. 
17 Q So how is it that that, we know that 
18 Officer was the primary crime scene 
19 investigator. How was it that it was decided that 
20 Detective would be the crime scene 
21 investigator? 
22 A The crime scene detectives have areas that 
23 they are assigned and if an incident happens within 
24 their given area, typically they are responsible for 
25 that, however, the decision ultimately rests with

1 the crime scene supervisor to delegate out who is 
2 responsible for, for example, the Crime Scene Unit. 
3 Q Okay. So you all just called for Crime 
4 Scene to respond and then they determine, the Crime 
5 Scene supervisor determines who is going to respond 
6 that day, correct? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q Okay. When you first arrived around 
9 1:30-ish, was St. Louis County ID Unit on the scene? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
I believe they had just arrived. 
And when you arrived initially, did you 
12 notice that there were cones that had been placed at 
13 various locations in the street and within the crime 
14 scene itself? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
I did. 
Okay. Did you ever, prior to the Crime 
17 Scene Unit getting there and beginning their 
18 investigation, did you ever walk the crime scene?

20 
21 
22

Q

Before they began their investigation?

24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I did. 
Did you see other detectives walking and

1 other police officers walking in the street and in 
2 that area? 
3 A I did. 
4 Q Okay. Now, is that something that is, 
5 well, given that the crime scene unit had not yet 
6 arrived to begin processing the scene or had not 
7 begun to process the scene, would that be something 
8 that in hindsight or is that something that 
9 shouldn't happen, people walking through the crime 
10 scene before it is processed? 
11 A Ideally, no. In this particular instance, 
12 the scene was, obviously, an outdoor scene. There 
13 was a need to take an overall assessment of what the 
14 situation was at that point, and so without 
15 disturbing any evidence or without walking near 
16 evidence, yes. There was some walking that had 
17 taken place just to get an overall assessment. 
18 Q Okay. And so at this point then Detective 
19 arrived and began processing the crime scene. 
20 Was his job interrupted at any point?

1 A Essentially the same instances that I had 
2 previously mentioned. The threats coming from the 
3 crowd, people trying to, as I said, breach the crime 
4 scene, meaning come under the tape and come into the 
5 crime scene and then, of course, the gunshots. 
6 Q All right. Was this scene complicated 
7 because it was outdoors, just in general, does that 
8 complicate a crime scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
No, not necessarily. 
Okay. So you believe that the primary 
11 factors that complicated your job on-scene that day 
12 was the crowd? 
13 A Yes, I do. 
14 Q Urn, did you make any attempts, well, all 
15 right, so detectives, describe for the grand jurors 
16 then, once the crime scene was in the process of 
17 beginning their processing of the scene, what did 
18 you do to further the investigation? 
19 A As I said, I originally spoke with Chief 
20 who indicated that the best person from the 
21 Ferguson Police Department to talk to would be 
22 
23 
Sergeant 
Sergeant 
I then went over and spoke with 
, as long as with several other 
24 detectives that I worked with, and we again, had a 
25 brief conversation with Sergeant 
FAX 314-241-6750

who indicated

Page 195 
1 to us, I'm sorry, who provided to us the information 
2 that he knew at the time. 
3 And then from there based on the 
4 information that Sergeant had provided, we 
5 initiated the investigation. 
6 Q So did Sergeant tell you that the 
7 police officer involved in the shooting was Darren 
8 Wilson? 
A He did. 9 
10 Q And now, did you know when you volunteered 
11 to take this assignment that the officer's name was 
12 Darren Wilson? 
13 A I did not. 
14 Q Okay. Are you in to 
15 Darren Wilson? 
16 A Absolutely not, no. 
17 Q After you learned that Darren Wilson was 
18 the officer involved, did you make attempts to see 
19 if there was 
20 ? 
21 A I'm very familiar with in the 
22 St. Louis area, , no. 
23 Q Okay. Have you ever met Darren Wilson? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
I've never met him.

tell you

3 Q Did you then assign detectives to go to a 
4 different location? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
I did. 
Where did you assign detectives to go? 
I assigned Detective , also of the 
8 Bureau of Crimes Against Persons, to go to the 
9 Ferguson Police Department where officer Darren 
10 Wilson had driven to after the incident. 
11 Q So you learned that Darren Wilson had gone 
12 back to the Ferguson station? 
13 A I did. 
14 Q And so what about, was there any decision 
15 to send a different crime scene investigator to go 
16 and seize Darren Wilson's weapon and to collect any 
17 other evidence he might need to collect at the 
18 station? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
There was, yes, ma'am. 
Who did that?

1 Q And so was it from the scene that you were 
2 making decisions and directing various aspects of 
3 the investigation? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And all along the way were other 
6 detectives contacting you or giving you information 
7 about what they were finding, what they were 
8 learning and so forth? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
They were. 
Okay. And so when you were on the scene, 
11 Detective, did you learn that there were individuals 
12 who were residents or who had been down on Canfield 
13 that day who had scene some or part of the incident 
14 involving, between the officer and Michael Brown? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And were there, was there a decision to 
17 direct a couple of the crime scene officers to 
18 actually take, I don't know, I'm calling them 
19 perspective videos, do you know what I mean when I 
20 say perspective videos? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
I do. 
Describe for the grand jurors what a 
23 perspective video is?

1 standing when a particular incident happened. 
2 So, for example, if an incident 
3 happened in this room, my perspective would be from 
4 this chair right here, we would simply take video 
5 from the chair that I'm sitting in. 
6 Q And so during your investigation and, you 
7 know, we know that this is a complex with several 
8 buildings, several units in each building. We know 
9 that the incident occurs, there's several yards in 
10 between the beginning of the incident and the 
11 furthest east portion of where the incident 
12 occurred. 
13 And so did you learn that there were 
14 people in various buildings who had claimed to have 
15 scene part of this? 
16 A I did. 
17 Q Okay. And so during that afternoon, did 
18 you learn that there was oh, gosh, a woman named 
19 who claimed to have scene something 
20 
21 
22 
23 
from, I guess, Building is that correct?

5 what someone standing there might be able to see, is 
6 that fair to say?

11 in your investigation you were also aware that there 
12 were some witnesses who testified that they were, I
