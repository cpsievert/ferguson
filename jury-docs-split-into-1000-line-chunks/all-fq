1 is that he was charging the officer, but you don't 
2 know for sure exactly what was going on. You were 
3 lost, you were out of your surroundings? 
4 A Correct. 
5 So you can't really say 
6 exactly what was going on? 
7 A Correct. And also, according to my 
8 journal, I guess the recollection of the officer's 
9 talking to the two boys before he backed up was what 
10 I read online and not what I seen. 
11 So you think there could 
12 have been, and you have said this, there is a lot of 
13 blurry lines there as far as what you read and what 
14 you really saw. So all you have to do is these 
15 bullet points about what you think you saw on that 
16 day and this was at 4:00, so this was after a three 
17 and a half hour time frame when you are trying to 
18 find your way home, you are trying to find, you are 
19 getting lost in the neighborhood. 
20 I'm not saying you are lying, 
21 (sic) I'm really not. I think you are confused. I 
22 want you to understand what you're saying could have 
23 been misunderstood.

15 skipped a weekend too somewhere in here. 
16 August 30th was the last day.

18 days that you write in your journal, correct?

20 is, I believe, it skips from the 22nd to the 24th,

All right. And so you contacted the

4 to you or did you come to them or on the phone or 
5 what? 
6 A I went to them. I believe it was here, 
7 no, it was down the street at the headquarters, not 
8 the two court buildings, but. 
9 Q It was the county police and not the FBI 
10 or was it all of them? 
11 A No, it was the police. The FBI, there was 
12 a gentleman there from the FBI. 
13 Q When you call the police, what do you tell 
14 them? 
15 A I don't remember, it would have been in

2 Q So you don't know when you're telling the 
3 truth? 
4 A No. I know what I had seen and what I had 
5 read online for the first day itself right prior to 
6 going up there would have became jumbled, and than I 
7 would have gotten facts confused because my memory 
8 would have been gone as far as what I truly seen

10 Q My question to you, you're not sure when 
11 you are telling the truth and when you are telling 
12 something that you may have just read?

15 electronic technology in communications. I also 
16 hold a ham radio licenses and an FCC license, which 
17 gives me the opportunity to work on large 
18 transmitters for like broadcasters and everything.

2 updates on the new technology that was coming out. 
3 Q So were you working for the, as a Motorola 
4 salesperson back when the City of Ferguson got their 
5 radio system installed. 
6 A Right. Back then, and it has got to be 
7 six, seven, I would have to look back, I replaced 
8 their console, their dispatch console from a button 
9 to a CTR, a computer driven dispatch console, which 
10 is used just to dispatch and turn on the radio 
11 transmitters along with filling in with some new 
12 portable and mobile radios. 
13 There is about a 10 to 12 year life 
14 expectancy on mobiles and portables. At that time 
15 they needed new equipment and I sold them the new 
16 equipment and also programmed it with the 
17 frequencies that was needed. 
18 Q And you think that that was about six 
19 years ago or thereabouts? 
20 A Six to eight years. They usually buy 
21 different times of the year because of their

3 Q And so do you think, are you familiar with 
4 the radio system that the Ferguson Police Department 
5 uses? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Okay. And, urn, are you aware that 
8 Ferguson dispatches for themselves? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so what does that mean, what does a 
11 dispatcher, and explain what it means when a 
12 municipality may dispatch for themselves as opposed 
13 to something else. 
14 A Well, they take the 911 call, they're 
15 considered a peace effort. It is a public safety 
16 answering point, they take the 911 calls, they look, 
17 they usually have a CAD system, computer added 
18 dispatch piece of software that they type in the 
19 address and they assign it at car and that car is 
20 then dispatched through the console, radio console. 
21 Q And so I understand that this is all done 
22 with computers, but there is a person who is the 
23 dispatcher, correct? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 municipalities dispatch for themselves? 
2 A No, in Ferguson's case they have Country 
3 Club Hills and Calverton Park, and the new entity 
4 Flordell Hills. They dispatch for those three other 
5 agencies also. 
6 Q Are there some municipalities that you are 
7 aware of where St. Louis County communications 
8 dispatches for some municipalities? 
9 A Off the top of my head, there is like 23 
10 different agencies that they dispatch their 
11 departments. 
12 Q Okay. So let's get some, I guess, 
13 vocabulary out of the way. You talked about a 
14 transmitter. What is a transmitter? 
15 A Transmitter is basically a box and it has 
16 a components for transmitting at different power 
17 levels they are programmable it is also box 
18 transmitter also is a receiver so it also receives 
19 radio transmissions as well as when the dispatcher 
20 keys up or pushes the talk button it turns 
21 transmitter on and the voice goes out through the 
22 transmitter. 
23 Q Okay. And where is the Ferguson Police 
24 Department transmitter? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750

1 there is a cell tower that's back there and their 
2 tower and their antennas are on top of that tower. 
3 At the bottom of this tower is a little shelter that 
4 their transmitters are placed. 
5 Q So the antenna is on a tower and the 
6 transmitter is on a box inside the shelter? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And then this is behind the Ferguson 
9 Police Department? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And so the console where the dispatcher 
12 would sit, is that inside the Ferguson Police 
13 Department? 
14 A Yes, and it's wired line out to the 
15 transmitter. 
16 Q And is that on a, like a phone line or? 
17 A It is like a phone line. It is not going 
18 through the phone system system's network, but it is 
19 like a pair of Cat 5 or a twisted pair of wires that 
20 are going out to the transmit site. 
21 Q So the dispatcher can communicate via the 
22 transmitter and she can receive, I say she, the one 
23 I'm thinking of is a she, can receive communications 
24 via the receiver? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes.

Right. 
And so explain what a portable radio is? 
A portable radio is what you see on the 
6 officer. It can be held in his hand to transmit, or 
7 a lot of them, a majority of them have what we call 
8 a remote speaker mike, which you'll see right on 
9 their shoulder that they can just key up the radio 
10 and talk and the walkie-talkie or portable radio is 
11 on their hips. 
12 The mobile radio is mounted usually 
13 inside the car and is usually a higher powered type 
14 of road versus portable radio, which is a 5 watt 
15 radio. 
16 Q So I'm going to show you, I haven't marked 
17 it, it is simply for demonstration purposes, but is

1 Q And what would happen if an officer tries 
2 to transmit, for example, on his mobile mike, so the 
3 car radio, while his portable is on and turned up? 
4 A You get a horrible squealing. It is 
5 called acoustic feedback, and it's a horrible 
6 squeal, it's like you're in a room and the 
7 microphones are turned up real high and you get that 
8 squealing noise, that's what the officer gets. And 
9 also at that time that is also being transmitted 
10 back to the dispatcher. So she will sometimes say, 
11 turn your walkie down or turn your walkie off. 
12 Q Again, so we can kind of, the walkie 
13 refers to the portable radio? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Okay. And so can an officer be in his 
16 vehicle and have his mobile radio on a particular 
17 channel, but have his walkie on a different channel? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes.

20 do you get that squelch or that feedback? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
No. 
Okay. Is there anyway for an officer, how 
23 does an officer select a channel on the walkie? 
24 A He has, there's two buttons and the one on 
25 the outer and this is usually a standard on all

1 Motorola radios, the one on the outside is your on 
2 and off button, and your volume control and then the

4 little ratchet clicking noise to it. A lot of the 
5 officers know by clicking it two or three times on 
6 what channel they're on. 
7 Q And so on this particular radio, the 
8 buttons are different height, correct?
