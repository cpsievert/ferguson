INTRODUCTION 
MR. MCCULLOCH: Thank you. I'm Bob 
Page 5 
3 McCulloch, the Prosecutor, for the record. I want 
4 to talk to you a little bit about this. As you are 
5 well aware of what we are here about and that is the 
6 shooting death of Michael Brown. 
7 I want to tell you how this is going to 
8 proceed. Obviously, it is going to be different 
9 from a lot of the other cases that you've heard, 
10 that you've heard during your term. 
11 First things first. Let me introduce, I 
12 say a lot of this you already know. These two 
13 ladies, for the record, Kathi Alizadeh, Shelia 
14 Whirley, they will be the primary, if not the 
15 exclusive attorneys working in the grand jury on 
16 this case. 
17 Obviously, I hope, obviously, there be a 
18 lot of other people working on things outside of us 
19 getting it ready for the presentation that will be 
20 made by Kathi and/or Sheila. 
21 Kathi was the prosecutor I have on call 
22 for the month of August for all homicide calls. So 
23 she received the call about this shooting within 
24 minutes of the time the County Police were notified 
25 by the Ferguson Police. So she has been working

1 with the police and lots of other things on this 
2 since the very beginning. 
3 My procedure is always that I have a 
4 prosecutor on call solely for homicide cases and 
5 they stay with that case from start to finish, 
6 whatever that ultimately may be. 
7 Sheila, as you know, has been assigned to 
8 the grand jury for this term and so she will 
9 continue with this grand jury on this case for as 
10 long as it does take. 
11 There are a few things I do want to go 
12 over, first and foremost, to tell you that this is 
13 the first, last and probably the only time I think 
14 that you will see me in relation to this case. 
15 Certainly in the grand jury. Everything that we do, 
16 everything that you do, will be recorded with the 
17 court reporter, who is under the same oath, 
18 essentially, as all the witnesses. 
19 As I said, Kathi and Sheila will be the 
20 primary attorneys, the attorneys responsible for 
21 presenting everything to the grand jury. 
22 Really, I'm going to go over just a few 
23 things to make sure that we have kind of the ground 
24 rules, but the procedure covered. 
25 As you know, your term ends on the lOth of

1 September. You also have dockets, there is no 
2 docket next week, but on the 3rd and lOth, we have 
3 dockets. Those dockets will be adjusted, but they 
4 won't be canceled. But they will be adjusted to 
5 accommodate whatever time that we need for 
6 presentations on this case. 
7 This case is still in the middle of an 
8 investigation, there is a lot going on and certainly 
9 you are well aware of what's going on in the 
10 evenings and during the day and even out in front of 
11 the courthouse here on occasions. 
12 So there is a lot that is still going on 
13 with the officers gathering the evidence, evidence 
14 is being tested, being evaluated. I say evaluated, 
15 it is being looked at, firearms evidence, the 
16 firearms people are looking at that, DNA evidence, 
17 the DNA are examining that. 
18 In addition, the federal government, U.S. 
19 Department of Justice, is doing a parallel, but an 
20 independent investigation of the same thing. 
21 So a lot of, actually everything pretty 
22 much that the County Police or any other state or 
23 local department is doing is being replicated by the 
24 U.S. Attorney, by the FBI, or by the Justice 
25 Department, they are all part of the Justice

1 Department. 
2 As that is going back and forth and there 
3 is some witnesses they will be talking to that the 
4 County Police may not necessarily be talking to. 
5 Some that the County had talked to that they haven't 
6 or won't talk to. And so, but all of that will be 
7 traded. We're giving them all the statements we 
8 have, they are passing statements and any other 
9 information that they have on this matter back to 
10 us. 
11 So it is still independent of one another, 
12 but sharing the information because what is 
13 significant to this case is also significant to 
14 theirs. They are looking at different 
15 possibilities. 
16 The federal government and the state 
17 government are not the same. We have these criminal 
18 charges, they look at potential civil rights 
19 violations, but for the same conduct that we are 
20 looking at for any potential criminal violations. 
21 So that may add a little bit, a little bit 
22 of a delay. I really don't want to say a delay, but 
23 kind of giving things to you out of order here 
24 somewhat. Like a trial, lots of information is 
25 going to come to you and it is going to come out of

1 chronological order. We will kind of go through 
2 that just as a schedule. The schedule is just that. 
3 There will be time if we have a particular 
4 area, just for example, the DNA evidence. If that 
5 is available or when that is available and all of it 
6 is available, not just part of it, we will have the 
7 time that is in the next two weeks to present that 
8 to you all at once. If it is a number of witness 
9 statements, we will present all of those to you. We 
10 will have it all organized and bring it in. 
11 By the time everything is finished, you 
12 will have heard everything, you will have every 
13 statement, there will be as many witnesses to come 
14 in and testify. 
15 If they made statements, you will not only 
16 get the statements they made, whether they are to 
17 police, FBI, or television or on the internet or 
18 anything else. If we've got those statements, you 
19 will have those statements. You will also have the 
20 witness who will come in and testify as to that. 
21 Some certainly might be they are just 
22 statements that are floating around on the internet 
23 and nobody knows who is making that statement, but 
24 everybody is doing that and the FBI is doing what 
25 they can to locate any of those or the source of

1 them. 
2 So the schedule though after 
3 September lOth, your term is extended, and the only 
4 matter that you will hear anything on will be this 
5 Michael Brown case, the Michael Brown shooting. All 
6 you get is that so you won't have the docket. There 
7 will be another grand jury that starts the week 
8 after that who will be doing what you have been 
9 doing for the past four months. 
10 By the way, greatly appreciate your 
11 service on that. I don't want to lose that in the 
12 message here. You have done a great job, a great 
13 service for the people of this county. 
14 But the schedule will then, it is as 
15 flexible as flexible can be. It is the only matter 
16 that you have and so there is no requirement that 
17 you meet on Wednesdays. So whenever all 12 people 
18 are available, because all the evidence will be 
19 presented to all 12, so we get all 12 of you 
20 together, we will work with everybody's schedule. 
21 Obviously, we want to be as expeditious as 
22 possible, but not rush through it. If that means we 
23 are meeting four hours in the morning and whatever 
24 works is what we are going to do. Saturdays, 
25 evenings, however it works for everybody's schedule,

1 and as long as you get it. If all 12 of you have an 
2 entire day, we will have an entire day. 
3 If you have four hours sometime, we will 
4 work all of that out, but we will work, obviously, 
5 around your schedules and you know how that's been. 
6 It is a little easier, I suppose, when you could 
7 tell family and employers and the like every 
8 Wednesday you had to be gone. So this will be a 
9 little different, so we will have to coordinate all 
10 of that. 
11 Also, not necessarily a requirement, we do 
12 want to meet here, but there is no requirement of 
13 that. If it turns out to be a Wednesday, then we'll 
14 figure out something on that. 
15 Everything will be recorded. Starting 
16 with the oath by the court reporter and everything 
17 that I'm saying now and everything that anybody 
18 says, whether it is a witness, whether it is one of 
19 the attorneys, or one of the jurors, will be 
20 recorded as we are going along. 
21 The value in the court reporter is that 
22 we're getting at least a rough transcript as we are 
23 going along. So that will, we won't have to wait 
24 six months for all of these tapes to be typed up if 
25 we did it in some other fashion.

1 The other is that the questions, you know, 
2 unlike a trial jury, you know, you can and have been 
3 discussing what you've heard on perhaps between 
4 witnesses or during breaks and the like. Remind you 
5 that's part of your deliberation and so none of that 
6 happens while there is anybody else in the room and 
7 that includes, of course, the attorney and the court 
8 reporter. 
9 At the end of every witness, the reporter 
10 will make an announcement that essentially he is 
11 going to finalize the disc. For every witness who 
12 testifies and every session of their testimony, 
13 there will be a separate disc made so that when he 
14 finalizes that, what it does is it finalizes the 
15 disc. 
16 After that, it can't be altered, nothing 
17 can be added, nothing can be deleted. And so if 
18 that witness comes back at some other time, there 
19 will be a separate disc for that and we will do the 
20 same. We will do that with every person who comes 
21 in and testifies. 
22 You will have presented to you every bit 
23 of evidence from the photos, from the scene of the 
24 shooting, diagrams of that, the physical evidence 
25 that was seized at the time, at the location, the

1 DNA evidence, anything and everything that pertains 
2 to this case will be presented to the grand jury. 
3 It will all be available to you for your review as 
4 it is coming in. 
5 Sheila, primarily, will be at least 
6 getting things started in terms of asking the 
7 witness questions, much as you've seen her for the 
8 whole summer doing that. 
9 Jurors, and you're experienced enough now 
10 that you can ask whatever questions you want to ask. 
11 Any item, anything you want to ask any witness, 
12 absolutely ask that information. 
13 If something occurs to you sometime after 
14 that witness is gone, we will get the witness back 
15 at some point and ask those questions again. If 
16 somebody else says something, you need to clarify 
17 it, we will get witnesses back to do whatever it is 
18 that you need done. 
19 The one thing we can't do in terms of 
20 questions, let me back up a little bit on that while 
21 we are talking about the records on that. 
22 Just remember that it is going to take a 
23 few minutes to finalize this disc once that witness 
24 is finished testifying. So if you have discussion, 
25 you want to talk or ask each other questions,

1 anything at all about that, make sure you wait long 
2 enough that that is finalized and they understand 
3 is out of here and the attorneys out of here. 
4 They will stick around long enough to remind you of 
5 that, wait until everybody is gone before you talk 
6 about it because that's, that's not something that 
7 anybody but the jurors hear. 
8 If you have a question about procedure, 
9 the attorneys will answer that. Who is coming in 
10 next, you know, we are taking a break now or can we 
11 take a break now, anything along the procedure the 
12 attorneys will certainly answer that. 
13 If you have a question about what a 
14 witness said or what is going on or did this witness 
15 say this, they're not going to answer those 
16 questions. If anything, we will get the witness 
17 back to answer any more questions that you asked, 
18 but we are not going to answer those questions. 
19 Just a couple other things. I assume the 
20 judge talked to you this morning, of course, about 
21 your oath, of course, both very similar to what 
22 just took, whatever the witness will take, 
23 that these are confidential proceedings, that 
24 nothing leaves this room unless and until ordered by 
25 the court or some other legal method. I will talk

2 The other is the confidentiality and the 
3 oath and the anonymity. You are anonymous. You are 
4 protected by law from all, your names are not 
5 public, your addresses, no information about you is 
6 public. 
7 There may be some, the demographics of it, 
8 I think that is information that can be passed out 
9 in terms of, you know, race, gender. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Age. 10 
11 MR. MCCULLOCH: I won't say the age. The 
12 general location that we have. Say, I don't know, 
13 three grand jurors who live in municipalities and 12 
14 who live in unincorporated or nine live in 
15 unincorporated. We have X number who are outside of 
16 the 270 loop, X number inside. So many above 70, 
17 below 70, all of that demographic information, but 
18 nothing that would, anybody would ever be able to 
19 identify any individual from just that no matter how 
20 they try to put it together. 
21 And that is, I just want to share, that's 
22 protected by law that's been litigated and those 
23 names, the information does not get released. 
24 So the other is with the parking. We are 
25 trying to arrange the parking very similar to what

are meeting some other day, you 
7 know, there may be media around, but the good thing 
8 about construction going on next door is we can kind 
9 of work around the visibility of it, particularly 
10 with the parking that we had. We will have all of 
11 that arranged. 
12 And the media, you know, the media kind of 
13 comes and goes around here. I did a number of 
14 interviews with local people today for a couple 
15 reasons, one is to get it all out of the way. So 
16 we're finished with, for the most part, with any 
17 kind of interviews with that. 
18 I can't control whether anybody shows up 
19 outside and just hangs outside the doors and all of 
20 that. If there is a protest scheduled or the media 
21 is going to be here. We will work with that again. 
22 We will know who is there and what's there and all 
23 of that. If need be, get you in and get you out of 
24 the building without worrying about any of that.

1 coming in, don't wear the grand jury badge and that 
2 will, won't tip anybody off that you are on the 
3 grand jury, we will have all of that stuff. 
4 Am I missing anything? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Note taking. 5 
6 MR. MCCULLOCH: Oh, you are right. Note 
7 taking. You take, as you know, all the notes that 
8 you want. Write down anything and everything. If a 
9 thought occurs to you, you want to talk to the 
10 witness, take all the notes that you want. The 
11 notes, of course, can't leave here. They are your 
12 notes and your notes alone. 
13 Fellow grand jurors won't see your notes 
14 and you won't see their notes. At the end of the 
15 day or end of the session, the notes will be 
16 collected and they will be secured. Any evidence 
17 that is presented to you, physical evidence, of 
18 course, also will be collected and it will be 
19 secured. We have highly secure evidence lockers 
20 within the complex here. All of that will be that. 
21 At the end of that, you can use your notes 
22 for any deliberation when everything is finished. 
23 At the end, just so you know, there are going to be 
24 massive amounts of information and physical items 
25 that are coming here in the next month. You're not

1 going to remember everything. The witness today 
2 testifies, you're not going to remember that a month 
3 from now, but all of that and the transcripts will 
4 all be available and you'll have as long as you 
5 need, as long as you want to go through everything 
6 again before you start your deliberations. While 
7 you are doing deliberations, all of that is 
8 available. 
9 Unlike a trial jury where you have to send 
10 a note out to the judge and the judge would decide 
11 if you get something or you don't get something, 
12 that rule doesn't apply here. Everything will be 
13 here in the room with you and you will have access 
14 to all of it. You, of course, have access to your 
15 notes throughout all of that. 
16 At the end of all of that, you won't have 
17 access to those notes, is that it? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I want to say that what Bob 
19 said, everything is going to be recorded in this 
20 room while we're presenting this case. That, of 
21 course, doesn't include your deliberations, those 
22 will not be recorded. And when we have juries who 
23 are hearing evidence in trial, typically the jury, 
24 not typically, always the jury is told prior to 
25 trial to keep an open mind throughout the entire

1 process, don't form any opinions until you've heard 
2 all of the evidence. 
3 There's no requirement that you all can't 
4 talk about things amongst yourselves. So if there 
5 is something that you all talk about and decide, we 
6 would like to hear from this person or you have a 
7 question about us bringing another witness in, you 
8 all can discuss that amongst yourselves so long as 
9 you are not deliberating and starting to form 
10 opinions until you have heard everything, okay. 
11 So there will be times for you all when 
12 there is no recording going on, where you all can 
13 discuss your schedule, you know, when we might meet 
14 again, and if there's any questions that you have 
15 that you want us to try to provide the answer for. 
16 Again, as Bob said, Sheila and I can't 
17 answer other than just procedural things or 
18 questions of law. But if there is some question 
19 that you have, if we can find somebody who can 
20 answer that question for you, we will do so, we'll 
21 try to bring somebody in to answer those questions, 
22 okay?

24 do need, and I know you will keep an open mind on 
25 everything. You haven't heard a single thing yet

1 other than what has been in the media, believe me 
2 that's not evidence. Don't form any opinion on 
3 anything that you've heard, good, bad or ugly in the 
4 media. 
5 Everything that's been collected, every 
6 statement that has ever been made, it will all be 
7 here for you. You need to keep that open mind to 
8 give everybody, including the entire community, a 
9 full and as open as it can be, but certainly as 
10 thorough and as expedient of all the evidence that 
11 you can. 
12 I know people keep talking about the 
13 transparency, at the end of all of this, depending 
14 on your determination, as other cases, if there are 
15 charges that you find should be lodged and are 
16 lodged, then all of that information will come out 
17 pursuant to the course of the case. There are rules 
18 that apply then as to how things are handled and all 
19 of that. It doesn't come out right away because you 
20 can't prejudice a potential jury panel. So all of 
21 that evidence, just like here, is presented to a 
22 trial jury in the courtroom and not put out in the 
23 media. So everybody can see it and then make their 
24 mind up before they ever come into a courtroom.

4 deliberations aren't, as I said, your deliberations 
5 are not recorded and never will be recorded, notes 
6 won't be released, but every bit of evidence that 
7 you have, the testimony of the witnesses who come 
8 in, the statements of the witnesses, the physical 
9 evidence, the photographs, everything that you have 
10 seen and heard will be released to the public. That 
11 is as transparent as we can get short of putting a 
12 pool TV camera in here and that's not going to 
13 happen. 
14 It is, obviously, an awesome burden, but 
15 it is going to be an awful lot of work and we will 
16 make it as orderly and organized as we can to you. 
17 As I said, if there is anything at all 
18 that we can do to do that, working with your 
19 schedules, work longer, we have no set hours. So 
20 whatever it takes, we will get that to you. We 
21 don't want to rush through anything, but we also 
22 don't want to drag it out. 
23 I'm anticipating, in all honesty, without 
24 basing it on a whole lot, that we hope to have this 
25 completed by the middle of October. It doesn't mean

8 Any questions now, procedure that I can

10 Alternate jurors, do we 
11 have them? 
12 MR. MCCULLOCH: We are in the hope that 
13 all 12 of you are perfect, healthy specimens, who 
14 have no plans to leave town or go on vacation for 
15 two months. All 12 will hear everything and the 
16 only way we have alternates is to have them in here 
17 at the time and we do that at a trial, but here it 
18 is just, it doesn't work in the grand jury. So we 
19 have all 12 when we can get all 12 of you together. 
20 If we can only get 11 together, we are 
21 going to have to find a different time. I hope 
22 everybody can be as flexible as possible, and again, 
23 we will be as flexible as possible. We have no set 
24 hours. Every day is Monday, weekends, whatever 
25 works for you is when we are going to be here.

3 the last time you will see me. I can't imagine what 
4 it would be unless there is something that came up 
5 that you wanted to see me, so thanks. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: As Bob said, Sheila and I 
7 are both going to be presenting this case to you and 
8 there may be times where I know Sheila has a case 
9 set for trial next week and it might just be, of 
10 course, we don't have next week. There might be 
11 days where you are only go to see me, only go to see 
12 Sheila, we are trying to split up the work as much 
13 as we can just to make it easier for the both of us, 
14 but there is no, don't read into anything about why 
15 is Sheila only having this witness or Kathi is 
16 presenting this witness because we are just trying 
17 to split it up. 
18 And so on days when Sheila might be 
19 presenting somebody, if I can be, I will also be 
20 here in the room, but I won't be commenting, I won't 
21 be asking any questions, it will be Sheila 
22 presenting, and the same thing on a day where I 
23 might be presenting a witness, Sheila may be here, 
24 but it is just for our benefit. We both want to see 
25 as much and as hear as much as we can, but there

23 autopsy. They don't go to the scenes, we go to the

1 A And bring back information for them so 
2 they can properly do the autopsy. 
3 Q I see. When you go to the scene, do you 
4 have any special tools that you take with you? 
5 A We have cameras and things to establish 
6 the time of death, and other equipment that we 
7 collect evidence. 
8 Q Okay. So tell us what a medical examiner 
9 does once, well, first of all, how do you get the 
10 call? 
11 A Usually a police officer or hospital or 
12 paramedic will call us and let us know there is a 
13 deceased person. 
14 Q Do you have a certain timeframe that you 
15 must follow? I know the person is always deceased

2 A Delivery service is the person who picks 
3 up the body. 
4 Q Do you call the delivery service when you 
5 get the call? 
6 A Correct. 
7 Q Once you get there? 
8 A No, once I get the call, I call them to 
9 let them know what is going on, where it is at. 
10 Q They meet you there? 
11 A Right. 
12 Q So at the scene once you arrive, what do 
13 you do? Like take us through an investigation. 
14 A I try to meet the reporting officer, speak 
15 to him, find out what happened. They go and look at 
16 the body and see if everything is consistent with 
17 what he told me or whatever witnesses told him, and 
18 then I come back and I would talk to the family or 
19 one of the witnesses if they were there. 
20 Q So when you talk to people, it is not 
21 necessarily the people who directly saw the 
22 incident? 
23 
24 
A 
Q

You are getting kind of hearsay
