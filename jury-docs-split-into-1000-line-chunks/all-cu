10 So from your vantage point where you were Q 
11 standing, are you looking at the driver's side of 
12 the car or the passenger side? 
13 A Driver's side. Well, at the driver's 
14 side. We were on that side of the vehicle, I 
15 couldn't see what was on the other side of the car. 
16 Q Okay. So then after he comes back, 
17 reverses and stops his car at an angle, what do you 
18 see happen between the boys and the police officer? 
19 A I didn't see, I just didn't see anything 
20 actually happen. We just kind of heard the two 
21 gunshots and I told my husband, oh, no, he's 
22 shooting, they're shooting. 
23 Q At this point did you know who was 
24 shooting? 
25 A No.

8 A No, I mean, it was just, like I said, we 
9 were walking up the steps and then all of the sudden 
10 the car was coming down the street, the kids were 
11 coming down the street, and I assume that he did

1 on the driver's side, he kind of hid on the back 
2 side of the car and that's when he ran, I'm hoping 
3 I'm saying this right, there is a grassy area, he 
4 kind of ran over this way, he kind of ran this way. 
5 Q Okay. So he's running now east down 
6 Canfield? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And can you tell at this point if he's 
9 injured? 
10 A Well, he ran this way and then he kind of 
11 got into the grassy area and he kind of stopped and 
12 looked down at his hands. I'm assuming there was 
13 blood, but he looked down at his hands and then he 
14 turned back around, he turned back around and 
15 started going back towards the police officer. 
16 Q Okay. Let's stop now.

1 Q Okay. So what do you want to guess that

16 Q Were you or your husband or anyone else 
17 that you can hear yelling anything, that you recall, 
18 saying to your husband, why won't he stop?

3 A He just, I mean, he was walking back 
4 towards him and he started, he started shooting. He 
5 just kept shooting, he just kept shooting. And I

23 shooting. 
24 And, of course, he couldn't answer

21 stop, and he didn't.
