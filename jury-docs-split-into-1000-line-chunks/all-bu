18 the officer, before the officer fired, I mean not 
19 fired, but I'm not sure at what point, I can

took 
outside 
He -- he, they both walked past me. I 
went into I came back 
to get some more stuff and I 
6 looked down the street and I seen the police car at 
7 a slant and I seen Mr. Brown in the window of the 
8 police car. It looked, it appeared as they were 
9 wrestling through the window. And one gunshot had 
10 let off and Mr. Brown took off running. 
11 And my first thought was like, oh, my 
12 gosh, did I actually just witness a police officer 
13 being murdered because it took a while for the 
14 police officer to get out of the car and pursue the 
15 suspect. 
16 And I want to say maybe six seconds, but 
17 it seemed like it was forever after the-- the first 
18 gunshot. So the police officer exited the vehicle 
19 with his weapon drawn, pursuing Mr. Brown. 
20 Mr. Brown was quite a distance and he stopped. And 
21 when he stopped, he didn't get down on the ground or 
22 anything, he turned around and he did some type of 
23 movement. I never seen him put his hands up or 
24 anything. I can't recall the movement that he did. 
25 I'm not sure if he pulled his pants up or whatever

1 he did, but I seen some type of movement and he 
2 started charging towards the police officer. 
3 The police officer then returned fire, not 
4 returned fire, open fire on Mr. Brown. Urn, if I had 
5 to guess, the shots and, urn, the distance between 
6 him and Mr. Brown, it would have to be five to 
7 ten yards. 
8 And the shots that were fired was four, 
9 five or six shots fired, and Mr. Brown was still 
10 standing up. Urn, and my thoughts was wow, he's 
11 missing this guy this close, is he hitting him or 
12 because Mr. Brown there was no reaction from him to 
13 show that he was being hit. 
14 Urn, after that, Mr. Brown then paused, 
15 he -- he -- he stopped running and when he stopped 
16 running, the police officer stopped firing. And 
17 then Mr. Brown continued, started again to charge 
18 towards him and after that, the police officer 
19 returned fire and, urn, well, not returned, I'm using 
20 the wrong term, he started to fire once more at him. 
21 Urn, if I had to guess the rounds that were 
22 fired then, it would be four to five more shots.

5 was closer to the scene where the shooting was at, 
6 that occurred. They then drove off and made a -- a 
7 left into the apartments and drove around the 
8 apartment and then came and stopped.
